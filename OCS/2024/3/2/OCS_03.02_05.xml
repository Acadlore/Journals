      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Global water supplies are impacted by the Earth's water cycle, which is significantly affected by climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Hao et al., 2023</xref>). By speeding up evaporation and changing the distribution of precipitation, rising temperatures make droughts more frequent and severe in certain areas while raising the danger of flooding in others. Climate change makes urban floods more severe, particularly in developing countries. This study states that urgent action is required to protect vulnerable communities as climate change is predicted to increase rainfall unpredictability. This increased variability in precipitation patterns seriously threatens urban areas that need proper stormwater management systems. Extreme weather events impact water quality and are exacerbated by climate change. Enough rain can overwhelm water treatment plants and increase the outflow of pollutants. Warmer seas also tend to have higher rates of toxic algal blooms, degrading water quality. This study emphasizes how climate change worsens flood control and water management issues in rapidly urbanizing areas. Global water management systems are being strained by these changes, which also escalate competition for scarce water supplies and possible geopolitical tensions worldwide. Developing nations are more susceptible to these abrupt transitions, frequently requiring more significant infrastructure and resources. According to this study, addressing these problems through Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) may be a viable solution that complies with integrated flood risk management and green infrastructure objectives. Suction-controlled drainage systems and enhanced flood mitigation capabilities are highlighted as possible ways to improve climate resilience with SUDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Deng et al., 2024</xref>). Quantitative bibliometric techniques that detect, measure, and statistically analyze hydroclimatic changes are essential to understanding climate change impacts on water resources and flooding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Ngong Deng &amp;amp; Ikhsan, 2024</xref>). This study reviews the literature on critical bibliometric methods to assess climate change effects on hydrology and flood hazards, including trend analysis, correlation analysis, rainfall-runoff modeling, flood frequency analysis, and multivariate statistical approaches. The strengths and limitations of these techniques are discussed, along with essential findings, uncertainties, and future research needs. Successful bibliometric analysis is crucial for elucidating climate change and hydrology linkages to support adaptation efforts in water resource management and flood risk reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Deng et al., 2023</xref>). The articles analyze the projected impacts of climate change on drought frequency and intensity across the globe using VOSviewer techniques.</p><p>In climate change and global water research, trend analysis starts with careful data from trustworthy sources, including long-term hydrological and climate records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Zeleke et al., 2022</xref>). Then researchers carefully examine the data quality, using the proper statistical methods to deal with anomalies and gaps. Using the correct parameters in trend analysis is essential to obtaining insightful findings. To account for natural climate variability, researchers usually select a time series that spans at least three decades. Spatial scales can be used to examine the effects of climate change in various geographic contexts, from local to global. Important climate variables usually include temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration; important hydrological variables include streamflow, soil moisture, and groundwater levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Rossi &amp;amp; Peres, 2023</xref>). Trend analysis has numerous benefits that give policymakers quantifiable proof of long-term variations in water supplies, empowering them to make well-informed decisions. Trend analysis identifies regions most susceptible to the effects of climate change, supporting focused adaptation strategies. Correlation analysis starts with careful variable selection in climate change and water research, emphasizing pertinent hydrological and climate characteristics. To provide reliable results, data pre-treatment is crucial and should include multicollinearity tests and normalization. Depending on the data type, researchers can then calculate correlation coefficients like Pearson's r or Spearman's rho. Observed correlations are subjected to rigorous significance testing to ascertain their statistical validity. The last stage entails carefully interpreting the data and assessing the direction and strength of links between variables to decipher the intricate connections between climate and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Wang et al., 2023a</xref>).</p><p>The data distribution and the study's goals determine which parametric and non-parametric correlation techniques are best. The usual significance thresholds are Î± = 0.05 or 0.01 to balance the dangers of Types I and II errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alaoui et al., 2024</xref>). Researchers must also ensure that the spatial and temporal scales of climate and water variables are well matched and consider possible lag times in hydrological responses to climate forcings. Using correlation analysis in water and climate change studies has various benefits. It reveals complex connections between water and climatic variables, assisting in identifying essential factors influencing hydrological changes. Additionally, by facilitating the creation of prediction models, this approach improves the comprehension of the dynamics of water resources in the future. Furthermore, this approach needs to be modified to simplify complicated, non-linear connections in hydrological systems because it is susceptible to outliers and problems with data quality. Modeling rainfall runoff is a sophisticated way to comprehend how climate change affects water supplies. The first step in the process is the careful selection of the model. Depending on the research goals and the availability of data, one might choose between conceptual, physical, or data-driven techniques. The next step is data preparation, which entails gathering and pre-processing important input variables like temperature and rainfall. Parameter estimation is a crucial step in guaranteeing that model parameters accurately depict hydrological processes, and it involves calibrating model parameters using historical data. Thorough model validation with separate datasets is necessary to evaluate its predicted ability. Lastly, to assess potential effects on water supplies in the future, researchers run calibrated models using predicted climate data as part of climate change scenario analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Kone et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In rainfall-runoff modeling, choosing parameters necessitates striking a careful balance between computational efficiency and model complexity. The study objectives and available data must be carefully considered while selecting the spatial and temporal resolutions. To capture representative hydrological conditions, it is essential to choose the appropriate calibration periods. To evaluate the model's correctness, researchers must additionally use pertinent performance metrics, such as Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) or Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). Using rainfall-runoff modeling in water and climate change studies has various advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Huntjens et al., 2012</xref>). Quantitative forecasts of future water resources under different climate scenarios make robust impact assessments possible. Scenario analysis is made possible by this method, which aids in assessing various management techniques considering climatic unpredictability. Furthermore, complex models can include the effects of land use and climate change, providing a more complete picture of future hydrological circumstances. However, these models have certain drawbacks, such as the quality of the input data and parameter estimation, which can affect the results and lead to uncertainty propagation in climate projections through hydrological simulations. In addition, significant computational resources might be needed for complicated, distributed models, making their general deployment difficult. Utilizing bibliometric techniques in climate change and water research provides an effective way to discover patterns in research and areas of incomplete information. This method starts with carefully selecting databases, concentrating on extensive scientific repositories like the Scopus database. Subsequently, scholars develop intricate search tactics, creating exhaustive query phrases that encompass the entire range of pertinent material. Then data extraction gathers comprehensive bibliographic data, such as authors, titles, abstracts, and citation information. Subsequently, sophisticated bibliometric methods like co-citation analysis and keyword co-occurrence are employed to reveal trends and connections in the literature. Developing powerful visuals like network maps and time series plots is the last phase in effectively communicating research patterns and multidisciplinary relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Brandt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In bibliometric analysis, choosing a parameter needs considerable thought. Researchers must establish appropriate periods to document changing research trends. Choosing which document categories (articles, reviews, and conference papers) to include can significantly influence the outcome. Identifying pertinent subject areas ensures a targeted examination of water and climate change. To balance comprehensiveness with the requirement to emphasize crucial contributions, citation thresholds may be set to identify highly significant works. Using bibliometric analysis in water and climate change studies has many benefits. It offers a thorough summary of research trends and aids in identifying new areas of study and knowledge gaps. This approach directs scholars toward important contributions by highlighting significant writers, organizations, publications, and leading countries on the study subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Batisha, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, bibliometric analysis identifies interdisciplinary links that promote the exchange of ideas among linked fields. Still, this strategy might have drawbacks, such as the need to be more impartial toward English-language periodicals and reputable journals, ignoring significant contributions from underrepresented areas or newly established channels. Although applicable, citation counts may only sometimes accurately represent the significance or goals of research, requiring a thorough analysis of the findings. Through the collaborative integration of trend analysis, correlation analysis, rainfall-runoff modeling, and bibliometric techniques, scholars can enhance their comprehension of the effects of climate change on worldwide water resources. This multidisciplinary approach helps develop more efficient and sustainable water management plans in a changing environment by identifying essential knowledge gaps and supporting evidence-based decision-making.</p><p>A vital strength of the approach is using an ensemble of multiple climate models to capture some of the uncertainty in future climate projections. The flood bibliometric analysis method simulates a minimum number of articles, review papers, conference papers, and books published under different institutions, countries, and organizations to indicate drought hazards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Choi et al., 2023</xref>). The analysis uses a statistical relationship between past drought intensity and reported losses, disaggregated by the financial sector, to estimate economic losses from droughts. Based on historical data from the Scopus database, this empirical approach allows sector-specific vulnerabilities to be accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Kotlarz &amp;amp; Bejger, 2024</xref>). Bibliometric analysis is a valuable method for evaluating and measuring the current level of study regarding a particular topic by examining material that has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Agodzo et al., 2023</xref>). Bibliometrics can provide insights into the development, influence, hotspots, and emerging themes within an area of study by examining features such as publishing trends over time, highly cited works, influential authors, journals, institutions, and keywords. This work aims to perform an extensive bibliometric analysis of studies concerning the effects of climate change on water supplies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Agodzo et al., 2023</xref>). Publications on Scopus data can be examined to evaluate the productivity, citations, collaborations, funding sources, and topic clustering of this vital field of climate change research, using data from academic databases such as Scopus. The findings can shed light on essential publications, top universities, nations, and study areas influencing how the impact of climate change on water availability, quality, flooding, droughts, and other hydrological repercussions is perceived. In the end, bibliometric mapping offers a comprehensive picture of the current level of knowledge to drive future research efforts toward more effective water resource management and climate adaptation plans in the face of global warming.</p><p>Climate change has a significant impact on the global water supply. It alters the timing of rainfall, making severe natural disasters like floods and droughts more intense and frequent, and reducing the quantity and quality of water available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Van der Pol et al., 2015</xref>). These changes must be understood and anticipated by the agricultural sector, human health and safety, environmental protection, and the control of water resources. Bibliometric monitoring and analysis tools have drawn increased attention to studying water concerns related to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Hsieh &amp;amp; Yeh, 2024</xref>). Bibliometric methods use VOSviewer analysis as indicators or sensors to assess environmental conditions based on the number of authors studying climate change related to water issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Gabriele et al., 2022</xref>). This could include analyzing countries, institutions, and organizations that have published many articles on climate changeâs ability to reconstruct past hydrological conditions for water-related applications. It also encompasses monitoring areas, studies, and funding sources to focus on the effects of climate change on vegetation as biosensors of current water quality and quantity.</p><p>Using bibliometric indicators offers some potential advantages over conventional physical and chemical monitoring alone. Bibliometric method analysis integrates environmental signals over time, providing a more holistic picture with some bioindicators that can be highly sensitive to specific stressors. Additionally, historic bibliometric data preserved in natural archives like sediments or trees can extend the understanding of environmental baselines before human influences. However, bibliometric methods have limitations, such as complex biological responses, with multiple interacting factors driving observed changes. The sectoral vulnerability remains constant over time rather than adapting to climate change. There can be significant spatial and temporal variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>). Establishing quantitative linkages between bibliometric indicators and specific environmental drivers, like climate change, is challenging. Bibliometric investigations can offer essential insights when paired with other data sources and modeling techniques. This study discusses the benefits and drawbacks of employing different bibliometric approaches to examine how climate change is affecting water supplies. In addition, this research points out the most important discoveries made in this expanding field of study, discusses any lingering doubts, points out interesting new approaches and uses, and suggests areas for further investigation. To manage water resources successfully in a quickly changing environment, it is imperative to have a thorough understanding of the potential and constraints associated with bibliometric analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). This study addresses the advantages and disadvantages of current strategies for resolving floods and water scarcity issues. Some key conclusions from the review are as follows: drought frequency and intensity in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions are expected to rise; agriculture and the energy sector can be disproportionately affected; and rainfall may help some areas experience less water stress while making others experience more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Albatayneh, 2023</xref>). A more profound comprehension of dynamic sectoral vulnerabilities, independent and premeditated adaptation mechanisms, techniques, cascade impacts, and ecological impacts is among the future studies that need to be mentioned in the review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Van der Pol et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it is acknowledged that a critical obstacle to a deeper understanding and management of the intricate interactions between water shortages and climate change is the integration of climate models with multidisciplinary impact assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">McClelland, 2023</xref>). The review emphasizes the need for context-specific, interdisciplinary approaches to address the complex challenges of flooding and water scarcity brought on by climate change, even though it does not explicitly focus on bibliometric method analysis alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Stathi et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, it offers a thorough overview of knowledge, current initiatives, and research gaps.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Globally, society, its economic growth, and the environment are all at risk from the effects of climate change. These phenomena, mainly caused by human activities, cause the weather on Earth to change drastically and quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Levin et al., 2024</xref>). Economic existence, ecological systems, and humanity are all impacted by climate change. The severity of the issue is highlighted by the increasing frequency and intensity of catastrophic natural disasters, such as storms, flooding, droughts, and extreme weather, which endanger public health, food security, and the stability of the world economy. Scientific research is essential in this context. It allows us to evaluate the effects of climate change on different natural and human systems and comprehend its intricate dynamics. The principal manner in which climate change influences water resources is through alterations in the hydrological cycles. Weather and precipitation patterns change rainfall's quantity, timing, and magnitude. There's a chance that certain areas would have more extended droughts because of reduced precipitation, while other areas might get heavier rainfall, which would raise the possibility of flooding. This variability in water availability impacts energy production, agriculture, and water for consumption accessibility, making successful utilization of water resources difficult. Moreover, increased sea levels brought on by the disintegration of ice caps and mountains may deplete freshwater availability. This technique has the potential to negatively impact agricultural areas by decreasing the amount of accessible potable water and decreasing crop output and fertility. Floods and habitat degradation are more susceptible to these changes because they are more common in coastal populations. Water quality is also impacted by climate change. Elevated temperatures have the potential to cause increased evaporation rates, which in turn can concentrate pollutants in water bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Mahreen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, severe weather conditions like floods and heavy rains can overwhelm stormwater systems, contaminating water sources with sediments, pollutants, and pathogens. Such occurrences pose significant dangers to aquatic ecosystems and human health, necessitating large investments in infrastructure and water treatment to guarantee pure water for use and consumption. Climate change poses severe risks to human populations because of its numerous immediate and secondary impacts on their livelihoods, the availability of food and water, health, and displacement. Global warming and extreme weather events cause an increase in the incidence of heat-related illnesses, respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, and a wider spread of vector-borne infections. Variable precipitation patterns and unpredictable weather can hurt agricultural productivity, threaten food security and increase prices. Farmers and fishermen, for example, who rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, are particularly vulnerable economically, and displacement and climate-induced migration are driven by resource scarcity and environmental deterioration. Furthermore, as traditional modes of existence become unsustainable, communities' social and cultural fabric, especially those of indigenous and rural populations, is in danger. To address these complex issues and safeguard human well-being in the face of climate change, there must be calls for extensive adaptation and mitigation measures, international collaboration, and a dedication to sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Gude, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Science provides the resources required to create adaptation and mitigation plans that work, suggesting creative ways to lower greenhouse gas emissions, safeguard delicate ecosystems, and assist impacted communities. In addition to stimulating public discourse and influencing political choices, scientific research offers a strong foundation for creating bold, fact-based climate policy. Within this framework, bibliometrics, the quantitative analysis of scientific literature, is becoming an increasingly helpful instrument for evaluating and comprehending the development of research on climate change. Bibliometric analysis can be used to map the field's scientific landscape and discover emergent research subjects, significant contributors (researchers, institutions, and nations), collaborative networks, and publishing patterns. This method summarizes climate change's worldwide scientific research goals, emphasizing accomplishments, knowledge gaps, and prospective avenues for future investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Taseska et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, bibliometric analysis is a priceless tool for scientists, decision-makers, and other interested parties engaged in the battle against climate change. It offers them vital information to direct future endeavors and optimize the influence of scientific inquiry on this worldwide issue.</p>

      <title>3. Research methodology</title>
      <p>The research technique uses a thorough bibliometric approach to examine the literature on water-related aspects of climate change. The criteria for selecting data and the methods for processing it were thoughtfully created to guarantee thorough and pertinent outcomes. The primary data source for this study was the Scopus database because of its comprehensive coverage of scholarly articles and ease of use. This choice makes it possible to provide a current and comprehensive field representation. To ensure pertinence in presenting research patterns, the analysis concentrated on articles released in the previous ten years, specifically from 2014 to 2024. This timeline aims to provide enough information for insightful research while catching recent events. The Scopus database was searched using the phrase "climate change related to water issues" to locate pertinent publications. This general but targeted research question guarantees that a variety of papers are included while keeping the topic of the study precise. After this, the search results were exported as a Microsoft Excel (CSV) file, guaranteeing data availability and enabling additional analysis. Refinement and analysis of the gathered data required several steps in the data processing process. Using the built-in analytical capabilities of Scopus, the initial dataset was analyzed to produce an initial picture of the literary landscape. The data was then loaded into the VOSviewer program for a more thorough bibliometric study. The decision to use the VOSviewer was made because of its extensive use in bibliometric and citation research worldwide. This program may build and visualize intricate bibliometric networks while considering relational factors like co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, and source relationships. Using VOSviewer improves the study's repeatability because it is a widely available and well-documented tool in the field.</p><p>To give a thorough picture of the state of the field, the analysis concentrated on a few essential topics. These include grouping keywords associated with water and climate change, analyzing author partnerships, and classifying sustainable development. This multifaceted strategy guarantees a comprehensive examination of the topic from multiple angles. Non-English documents, reviews, book chapters, conference papers, and other non-article document formats were eliminated to improve the dataset further. The choice was made to concentrate on peer-reviewed research articles because they usually contain the most recent and meticulously examined scientific information. These methodological decisions make sense since they allow for a systematic, thorough, and repeatable study of the state of climate change research concerning the management of water resources. The research maintains transparency and facilitates future replication or extension by other scholars utilizing well-established bibliometric approaches and commonly used software tools. Through statistical analysis, this method captures the quantitative components of the literature and makes it possible to visualize the intricate linkages throughout the research community. Such visuals can highlight partnerships, patterns, and trends that conventional book review techniques would miss, providing insightful information about the field's history and present situation.</p><p>A thorough search and analysis of the literature on using the bibliometric method analysis in comparative studies reveals that over 1,159 articles have been indexed in the Elsevier Scopus database. There is an urgent need to systematically analyze and present a comprehensive overview of the climate change research status and water resources management in the application of review research, given the over 703 non-English documents, reviews, book chapters, and conference papers. Books, editorials, notes, erratums, letters, conference reviews, data papers, and short surveys were analyzed in the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis is considered a crucial method for investigating and evaluating the scientific literature to demonstrate any subject of study's present expansion and potential future directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Gyanendra et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, this work presents and examines the research and publication landscape of bibliometric method analysis using various applications, such as VOSviewer, in climate change. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the techniques for data recovery, screening, and analysis from published documents.</p>

            <title>4.2. Highly cited publications</title>
          
          <p>A bibliometric analysis tool, such as VOSviewer, was used to process the cleaned dataset, which shows the generated visualizations and metrics to analyze the growth of publications over time. With a participation percentage of 17% and the highest number of published articles (757) on âGeneral Earth and Planetary Sciences,â it stands out significantly from other journals. The leading journals are "Water Resources Research" and "Agricultural and Biological Sciences: Soil Science," with 4407 papers. Approximately half of the publications on this topic are published in these three journals. To examine this in more detail, the annual distribution of the number of papers published for each publication is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. The magazine "General Earth and Planetary Sciences" has been a top publication recently. In addition, the publication of works on this topic in 2014 has been greatly aided by the three journals "General Earth and Planetary Sciences," "Water Resources Research," and "Agricultural and Biological Sciences: Soil Science." Therefore, examining research sources can help scholars swiftly identify pertinent research papers from sources and choose an appropriate journal for the future publication of their manuscripts. With an emphasis on soil science and water resources, this study examines highly cited works in earth and planetary sciences. It shows that "General Earth and Planetary Sciences" is the most popular category and that most articles on the subject are published in three journals, indicating the interdisciplinary nature of the research. The primary contributions of the study are found in the way it uses bibliometric tools to illustrate publication trends over time, offering a thorough picture of the state of research and pinpointing the major journals responsible for most of the research output. The analysis recommends the following directions for further research: looking for developing themes in the context of highly cited articles, the geographic distribution of research, and financing sources and how they affect research objectives. The understanding of the area could also be improved by examining how research themes change over time, investigating authorship networks and collaboration patterns, and evaluating how publications affect practice and policy. Researchers can benefit significantly from these analyses, which help shape future research projects and publication plans in the earth and planetary sciences. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> shows the research sources.</p>

            <title>4.8. Leading funding organizations</title>
          
          <p>For upcoming resilience research, this study thoroughly describes the funding agencies and papers about climate change and water-related concerns. Global funding organizations are interested in improving resilience to climate change's consequences, particularly in water-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">PorÄbska et al., 2023</xref>). The funding of studies to increase understanding and develop strategies for lessening and mitigating the effects of climate change depends heavily on these organizations. The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) leads this study and has supported 105 publications on climate change. Because of its dedication to furthering science, the NSFC is positioned to significantly contribute to climate change resilience, particularly regarding water-related issues. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is closely trailing in the United States, having provided funding for 49 publications. Through its research grants, this prestigious organization fosters creative solutions in response to the pressing need to address the effects of climate change on ecosystems and water supplies. The European Commission and its Horizon 2020 Framework Program have also made significant contributions, which have financed 33 and 43 documents, respectively. These actions demonstrate how committed the European Union is to solving environmental challenges worldwide, particularly climate change's effects on water systems.</p>

      <title>5. Limitations and prospective paths</title>
      <p>Although it is extremely helpful to use bibliometric techniques to investigate climate change and its effects on water resources, those techniques have limitations. The study can unintentionally ignore essential insights from other sources and linguistic settings by concentrating only on English-language articles and using the Scopus database as its only source of information. This restricted focus may need to be extended to understand how research on the topic is seen globally. Moreover, the focus on highly cited papers may need to pay more attention to new ideas and developing patterns seen in the less cited literature, even though it may capture influential work. Given the study's narrow selection of bibliometric methodologies, a more in-depth analysis is possible. Increasing the number of methodological tools in the toolbox may produce more trustworthy and consistent outcomes, providing a more thorough grasp of the field of study. Furthermore, the broad classification of subjects without thoroughly examining groups limits comprehension of the complex connections among important domains like risk assessment, environmental monitoring, and sustainable development objectives. By addressing these constraints, future research could significantly improve the researchers' understanding of climate change's impacts. A more comprehensive understanding of the area would be possible using a wider range of document types and data sources than Scopus. A fully global view of sustainability studies would be captured by including publications written in many languages. Expanding the focus to encompass a more diverse array of publications, even ones with fewer citations, may reveal up-and-coming patterns and inventive methodologies that need to be noticed. On the other hand, a more comprehensive range of bibliometric approaches would produce more complex and trustworthy findings, providing a more in-depth understanding of research trends and partnerships. Lastly, a thorough examination of each of the individual categories of climate change, water management, sustainable development, environmental impact, groundwater, drought, and biodiversity would shed light on the intricate relationships among these crucial fields and possibly open new directions for cross-disciplinary study and real-world sustainability applications.</p><p>These limitations must be recognized and addressed to improve knowledge and create practical plans for strengthening resistance to the water-related problems brought on by a changing climate. The intrinsic complexity of biological reactions to environmental stressors is one of the most significant limits. It can be challenging to determine specific causal correlations between bibliometric markers and particular drivers, such as climate change, due to the complex web of interactions between different biotic and abiotic elements. Because hydrological systems and ecosystems are dynamic and constantly changing in response to a wide range of stimuli, it is challenging to identify and measure the effects of a single issue, like climate change, on water resources. Moreover, considerable temporal and regional variability in bibliometric indicators can impede the establishment of reliable quantitative relationships between these indicators and environmental variables. Hydrology, terrain, and climate impact the intricate spatial patterns and temporal dynamics that define water systems and their ecological processes. The results obtained from the bibliometric analysis may provide uncertainties and difficulties in interpretation and generalization due to this heterogeneity. The assumption that sectoral vulnerability stays constant over time rather than adjusting to the effects of climate change is another flaw noted in the document.</p><p>This presumption might not fully capture the dynamics of the natural world, as people and sectors frequently use adaptation methods and modify their activities in response to shifting environmental conditions. An insufficient understanding of the vulnerabilities and resilience of different sectors to water-related difficulties exacerbated by climate change may result from failing to account for these adaptive capacities. The statement also recognizes the significant challenge of combining multidisciplinary impact assessments with climate models, which is necessary for more thorough comprehension and management of the intricate relationships between water scarcity and climate change. Integration of climate models and impact assessments is complex since they frequently function in distinct discipline silos.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, the paper offers insightful analysis and identifies promising directions for further study on water and climate change challenges. One of the main recommendations is the necessity of context-specific, interdisciplinary approaches to handle the complex difficulties of flooding and water scarcity brought on by climate change. These problems cut across academic lines and necessitate integrating expertise from several disciplines, including policy studies, ecology, hydrology, climatology, and the social sciences. A more profound comprehension of the dynamic sectoral vulnerabilities and the strategies used by various sectors to adjust to the effects of climate change on water supplies can be facilitated by interdisciplinary collaborations. Researchers can better understand the complex interactions between natural systems, human activity, and climate change by combining a variety of viewpoints and approaches. This can result in more comprehensive and successful outcomes. To overcome this constraint, researchers from various disciplines must collaborate and share their expertise to create comprehensive frameworks that capture the complex relationships between these concerns.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Due to its disruption of the hydrological cycle and increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as storms, floods, and droughts, climate change poses a severe danger to the security of water supplies worldwide. This thorough research shows the importance of comprehending and managing the intricate links between climate change and water resources to assist adaptation initiatives, sustainable water management techniques, and flood risk reduction measures. To understand how climate change affects hydrology and flood dangers, this study emphasizes the importance of bibliometric analytic methods such as trend analysis, correlation studies, rainfall-runoff modeling, flood frequency analysis, and multivariate statistical approaches. The review recognizes the inherent limitations of these methods, which include the assumption of static sectoral vulnerability over time, the complexity of biological responses to environmental stressors, and the spatiotemporal variability in hydrological systems, even though these methods provide essential insights. The paper highlights the necessity of multidisciplinary, context-specific methods incorporating information from several disciplines, including the social sciences, hydrology, climatology, ecology, and policy studies. Such cooperative initiatives can help advance knowledge of the dynamic sectoral vulnerabilities, strategies for adaptation, cascade effects, and ecological responses to water difficulties brought on by climate change. The analysis acknowledges the major challenge of integrating interdisciplinary impact assessments with climate models. This integration is essential to understanding the complex interactions between water shortages and climate change. To overcome this hurdle, multidisciplinary cooperation and the creation of thorough frameworks that capture the intricate connections between these related problems are needed. The text also emphasizes the significance of ongoing research projects and financial assistance from different institutions, such as government agencies, international organizations, and national science foundations. This consistent investment can protect water supplies and ecosystem resilience in a fast-changing climate. It can also advance scientific knowledge and direct policy decisions. This study concludes by comprehensively reviewing knowledge, research trends, and prospects for water-related concerns and climate change. It draws attention to how quickly these problems must be solved via interdisciplinary thinking, collaboration, and blending different fields of expertise. By recognizing the shortcomings of the current paradigm and embracing novel approaches, researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders can collaborate to develop practical solutions that promote sustainable water management practices and strengthen resistance to the water-related effects of global climate change.</p><p>The critical funding for future research is the effectiveness of bibliometric analytic methods in understanding climate change impacts on hydrology and flood risks while acknowledging their limitations. Multidisciplinary, context-specific methods incorporating information from the social sciences, hydrology, climatology, ecology, and policy studies are required. The shift in climate change research focuses on understanding the climate system to develop climate technologies and regulations, covering a broader range of topics such as environmental health, rivers, and groundwater. The rapid growth of climate change vulnerability research since 2014, with water resource-related issues being a key focus area. The significant increase in the volume of climate change research from 2014 to 2024 reflects growing global interest in addressing this issue. The strong impact of climate change on groundwater resources, with projections showing reductions in recharge in arid and desert areas. Based on these findings, this study suggests several policy recommendations and directions for future research, aiming to a) encourage multidisciplinary collaboration and the development of comprehensive frameworks to capture the intricate connections between related issues such as water scarcity and climate change; b) encourage interdisciplinary thinking and teamwork to create workable solutions that improve sustainable water management techniques and increase resistance to the effects of climate change on water; c) implement education programs on responsible water use to counteract the effects of climate change; d) foster more scientific collaboration between developed and developing countries to address climate change challenges globally; e) develop adaptive approaches based on a thorough understanding of potential climate uncertainties, combining short-term and long-term plans, and considering factors such as robustness, flexibility, reliability, and vulnerability to climate change; f) expand research on the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources, particularly in arid and desert areas where recharge reductions are projected to be severe; and g) integrate climate change research with studies on environmental health, rivers, groundwater, and the circular economy to address the broader impacts on sustainable development, social and economic factors, and carbon sequestration.</p>
