      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Amid the escalating demand for DC power supply and DC grids, DC-DC converters have been extensively studied and employed across various DC circuits, encompassing renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and interfacing devices. A pivotal role in these applications is played by DC-DC converters, primarily serving as a nexus between the DC bus and DC load, each having diverse voltage or power specifications. Of all the DC-DC converters, the DC-DC buck converter stands as one of the most fundamental and emblematic. However, it has been observed that such converters inevitably encounter both internal and external disturbances, collectively termed as total disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. These disturbances have been identified to comprise uncertainties in power generation equipment, electromagnetic noise, and variations in load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Moreover, challenges posed by input variations have been perceived to be more intricate compared to load changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Such complications are believed to escalate risks of power loss and potential equipment damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>For buck converters, achieving optimal dynamic and static performance in the face of these disturbances and varying operational conditions has been deemed imperative. Previous research findings have indicated the potential benefits of refining circuit topology or control strategy to bolster the DC converter's anti-disturbance rejection capability and voltage tracking performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. In numerous practical scenarios, the introduction of cutting-edge control strategies has been recognized as a straightforward and viable solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Yet, achieving desired control outcomes has been achieved by overhauling existing DC converter circuits, often accompanied by significant costs and extended developmental cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. A myriad of controllers, including proportional-integral (PI) control, model predictive control (MPC), sliding mode control (SMC), fuzzy control, and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), have been explored for electrical power converters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. A notable approach, the fuzzy SMC, was designed to supplant the traditional PI controller, primarily to curtail chattering phenomena and heighten robustness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, an enhanced linear ADRC was suggested to address the pronounced degradation of power quality during microgrid disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of advanced control strategies is believed to facilitate effortless parameter tuning and promote superior dynamic and static performance of power converter systems.</p><p>Renowned for its adeptness in managing multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with diverse constraints, MPC has been extensively employed, particularly within the power electronics realm, owing to its robustness and commendable steady-state performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Typically, the core components of MPC encompass a predictive model, a cost function designated for weight tuning, and a receding horizon for periodic amendments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. A recent study proposed an MPC-based scheme tailored for a dual active bridge DC-DC converter to elevate its dynamic performance while adhering to current stress limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. An intriguing revelation in this field has been the fractional order of real-world inductance and capacitance, implying that the current and voltage derivative relations for these components deviate from the integer order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, the intrinsic ability of MPC to adjust its horizon periodically has been postulated to exhibit commendable resilience against non-linearities and system uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Consequently, MPC emerges as a promising alternative control technique for the DC-DC buck converter, aiming to mitigate external disturbances and model uncertainties.</p><p>Historical models of the DC-DC buck converter were conceptualized with capacitance voltage and inductance current as primary states. These models were often accompanied by both matched and mismatched disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The emergence of mismatched disturbances is suspected to potentially prolong convergence time, suggesting that disturbance capabilities might be compromised by these mismatched disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Traditional physical testing systems have found the differentiation of output voltage challenging. However, observer-based soft sensing technology was identified as an optimal solution in practical engineering contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Consequently, an output error tracking model has been proposed to address these challenges, given its capability to reclassify mismatched disturbance as matched disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, observer-based control methods such as extended state observer (ESO), disturbance observer (DO), and generalized proportional-integral observer (GPIO) have been acknowledged as efficacious methodologies for disturbance estimation and compensation, rooted in the inner model theory. Predominantly, these control techniques are observed to mitigate both internal and external disturbances through a feed-forward channel in real-world control systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. For instance, a robust DO-based adaptive SMC strategy was conceptualized for humanoid support robots, aiming to stabilize tracking errors within a stipulated timeframe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Similarly, an ESO focused on the state model was developed to address both external and internal disturbances and uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. In another endeavor, a GPIO-aligned super-twisting SMC was crafted to enhance the tracking precision of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed regulation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. However, potential challenges for these observer methods, such as lagging observer convergence rates or overwhelming observer computations when paired with MPC, have been highlighted.</p><p>In the context of DC-DC buck converters, the disturbances - both internal and external - have been meticulously examined and subsequently categorized as total disturbances. The primary impetus behind this study revolves around the development of an optimized voltage tracking strategy for DC-DC buck converters, especially in light of input fluctuations and load variations. Consequently, an RESO integrated with a model predictive controller has been proposed, aiming to expedite the voltage tracking process of the DC-DC buck converter. The adoption of the MPC approach facilitates a cohesive design methodology, ensuring adherence to physical constraints while maintaining optimal steady and dynamic performances. Furthermore, a discrete average model has been introduced to both design and predict the continuous conduction mode (CCM), solidifying system stability and bolstering its anti-disturbance capabilities.</p><p>The notable contributions of this research can be distilled into the following points:</p><p>• A novel model has been formulated that amalgamates both matched and mismatched disturbances under the umbrella of total disturbances. It was observed that the rate of convergence remained uninhibited by the presence of mismatched disturbances.</p><p>• The implementation of RESO showcased an enhanced anti-disturbance capacity, particularly in response to deviations in input voltage and load resistance, demonstrating a more rapid convergence compared to the conventional ESO.</p><p>The structure of this article is organized systematically. In Section II, the innovative state-space system model, focused on the tracking error of the buck converter, is elucidated. The underlying principles of the proposed RESO-MPC are explored in depth in Section III. Performance assessments, grounded in simulation cases, are presented in Section IV. The article culminates in Section V, drawing conclusions from the research undertaken.</p>

      <p>In this section, the architectural design of the RESO for state and disturbance estimation is elucidated. Parallelly, the fundamentals of MPC are laid down, affirming its role as the primary controller.</p><p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, the intricate design of the RESO-MPC architecture emerges. It can be discerned that the RESO is formulated primarily for estimating state variables and the collective disturbances. Utilizing the output voltage data, alongside the RESO-estimated values, the MPC is then assembled. Culminating this process, a PWM signal is sculpted based on the controller's output, steering the buck converter's switch.</p>

</inline-formula>, respectively. The convergence rate, dictated by the observer gain, is intriguing: a more substantial observer gain accelerates the ESO convergence rate. However, caution is mandated, as a surge in gain might induce oscillations. Thus, ADRC parameter selection becomes pivotal. Given that the ESO foundation is rooted in state feedback, the value of the state variable becomes essential. A noteworthy observation is the tight relationship between the estimation discrepancies of <inline-formula>

      <p>Within this section, the parameters pertaining to the DC-DC buck converter, as well as the resultant simulation data, are detailed. Emphasis is placed on discerning the robustness and steady-state efficacy of the proposed RESO-MPC scheme through comparative simulations against the conventional MPC. For the purpose of these simulations, the buck converter was operated in a CCM to ensure its alignment with the desired model. MATLAB/Simulink was employed for these simulations, with initial conditions being configured to match desired input voltage levels. Essential component parameters of the DC-DC buck converter are delineated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> illustrate the performance metrics of the RESO-MPC, ESO-MPC, and the conventional MPC in scenarios encompassing variations in input voltage, output load, and reference output voltage, respectively.

      <p>Drawing from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, it is observed that the settling time for output voltage governed by the RESO-MPC controller is accelerated by margins of 0.03s and 0.01s compared to the MPC controller, during input voltage and load resistance alterations, respectively. Further insights from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that during transitions of output voltage from 6 V to 8 V and from 8 V to 5 V, the RESO-MPC-controlled system demonstrated a swifter settling time by 0.01s and 0.005s, respectively, compared to its MPC counterpart. Additionally, a discernable reduction in response curve variance of the output voltage, amounting to 0.12 V and 0.8 V, is noted under the RESO-MPC controller, as contrasted with the MPC controller during input voltage fluctuations.</p>

      <p>The analyzed simulation outcomes underscore the superior anti-disturbance and dynamic performance inherent to the RESO-MPC controller relative to the traditional MPC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> corroborate the enhanced disturbance rejection capability of the RESO-MPC controller in the presence of external perturbations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> further accentuates the proficiency of the RESO-MPC controller in swiftly achieving target values devoid of overshoots, while the conventional MPC exhibited a more protracted approach with noticeable overshoots. In essence, for DC-DC buck converters, the RESO-MPC controller emerges as a paradigm demonstrating commendable steady-state and dynamic performance coupled with an elevated anti-disturbance capacity.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The disturbance attenuation challenge within the context of the input and output of the DC-DC buck converter has been meticulously explored. An RESO was meticulously designed to estimate both state and disturbance variables. Convergence and stability were rigorously assessed using input-to-state stability criteria combined with Lyapunov theory. Through simulation, the efficacy of the presented control strategy was confirmed.</p><p>The following salient observations emerged from the simulation and experimental results:</p><p>• Firstly, the RESO exhibited an enhanced capability for tracking and resisting disturbances stemming from alterations in input voltage and load resistance.</p><p>• Secondly, the introduced RESO-MPC controller demonstrated superior dynamic performance in comparison to traditional MPC.</p><p>These findings corroborate the premise that a buck converter governed by a RESO-MPC controller can sustain high-quality outputs and efficiently counteract disturbances, even in the presence of sub-optimal circuit conditions.</p><p>The application of the proposed RESO-MPC strategy to converters boasting intricate topologies and diverse functionalities warrants further exploration, particularly in navigating multifaceted disturbances. Concurrently, further refinements and computational optimizations remain imperative for enhancing the MPC's performance.</p><p>Future research endeavors may extend the present study by examining the applicability and robustness of the RESO-MPC strategy across a wider array of converters and operational scenarios, thereby broadening its scope and potential utility.</p>
