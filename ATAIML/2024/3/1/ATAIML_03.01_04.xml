      <abstract><p>In the realm of digital image security, this study presents an innovative encryption methodology for color images, significantly advancing the traditional Vigenere cipher through the integration of two extensive pseudorandom substitution matrices. These matrices are derived from chaotic maps widely recognized for their cryptographic utility, specifically the logistic map and the skew tent map, chosen for their straightforward implementation capabilities in encryption systems and their high sensitivity to initial conditions. The process commences with the vectorization of the original image and the computation of initial values to alter the starting pixel's value, thereby initiating the encryption sequence. A novel aspect of this method is the introduction of a Vigenere mechanism that employs dynamic pseudorandom affine functions at the pixel level, enhancing the cipher's robustness. Subsequently, a comprehensive permutation strategy is applied to bolster the vector's integrity and elevate the temporal complexity against potential cryptographic attacks. Through simulations conducted on a varied collection of images, encompassing different sizes and formats, the proposed encryption technique demonstrates formidable resilience against both brute-force and differential statistical attacks, thereby affirming its efficacy and security in safeguarding digital imagery.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Ciphering images is the process of protecting them by altering their pixels in a way that makes them indecipherable. It protects image confidentiality and integrity, particularly when the images are sensitive and confidential, as in the military case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] and medical images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Perturbations in ciphering steps complicate the statistical relationships between original and ciphered images and make predicting them difficult. Diffusion, on the other hand, distributes data in its initial form efficiently and uniformly throughout the entire ciphered image. Encryption methods achieve diffusion and confusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] through dense substitution and permutation of each pixel. Substitution is performed by changing the image pixel values to other values. Permutation randomly arranges image pixels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] to conceal the statistical relationships between the image pixels. Various methods can be used for replacement, such as the substitution box (S-box) operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. As the patterns of replacement and permutations become more difficult, the situation becomes more unpredictable and complex. Therefore, a combination of replacement, which integrates dynamic affine functions, and permutations must be applied at the smallest unit of images, which is the pixel.</p><p>The most important component of the ciphering process is the key, which plays a vital role in protection and ciphering data confidentiality. Hence, the key must satisfy various criteria, encompassing considerations such as length, space, and complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. This implies that the user-inputted key for image encryption needs preprocessing to generate a more intricate form, such as a pseudorandom sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. However, these keys can also be changed by simply performing standard operations, such as rearranging the image stream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. In the current context of modern image encryption, the use of keys can produce real sequences of chaotic behavior that are sensitive to initial conditions, thus providing a high level of security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Chaotic methods have various variations, some of which are renowned for image ciphering, such as piecewise linear chaotic maps (PWLCMs), logistic, Henon, and skew tent maps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Focusing on the logistic and skew tent maps, they present several advantages, such as improving randomness and sensitivity, leading to more chaotic, unique, and secure sequences.</p><p>Most of the algorithms mentioned above use independent block encryption. Consequently, all these techniques remain vulnerable to statistical attacks. Moreover, the small size of their private keys exposes them to brute-force attacks. Additionally, in the absence of any diffusion or chaining function between the encrypted blocks and plaintext blocks, these techniques remain susceptible to differential attacks.</p><p>This study aims to develop a new image encryption cryptosystem using a large private key to guard against brute-force attacks. Additionally, diffusion and confusion functions are employed to ensure that the cryptosystem remains beyond the reach of differential attacks, placing the new technique out of the scope of any such attacks. Similarly, the integration of multiple pseudo-random vectors in the confusion process ensures strong protection against statistical attacks.</p><p>The rest of this study is divided into various sections, namely, a section on previous related work, detailing the assumptions and related research; a section describing the theoretical framework, explaining the basis of chaotic sequences, as well as classical Vigenere and affine techniques; a section detailing the proposed approach, revealing the nuances of the encryption and decryption processes; a section devoted to results and discussions, presenting the research findings, discussions, and comparisons with other similar techniques; and a section summarizing the findings and proposing research directions.</p>

      <title>2. Related works</title>
      <p>The prior sections explored the potential significance of confusion and diffusion features in image ciphering, applied across substitution and permutation procedures. Another aspect to highlight concerns the ciphering key quality. Research in the prior research on the design of methods that exploit permutation and substitution patterns, as well as on improving key qualities, has been a source of motivation for this study. Initially, substitution and permutation ciphering methods were applied exclusively to pixels. Recent research, such as the study of Sabir and Guleria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], highlights the increasing popularity of pixel-level substitutions and permutations as image processing techniques. Zhang and Tian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] presented a multiple image ciphering approach relying on 3D bit planes and a genetic central dogma to perform a permutation between bit planes. Similarly, Ramasamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] proposed an improved logistic map that included diffusion, key stream generation, and permutation to resist assaults. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] presented a method based on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) genomic sequence permutation operation that coupled one-way mapping networks with an XOR operation. Butt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] introduced a new image ciphering method using binary bit plane scrambling and the SPD bit plane diffusion technique for an ordinary image, incorporating elements of the card game technique. Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] investigated the resilience of HCIE when faced with a known-plaintext-only attack and a known-plaintext/chosen-plaintext attack. Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] proposed a new DNA-based method capable of performing the simultaneous functions of bit plane searching and pixel diffusion in a single step. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] proposed an improved algorithm aimed at eliminating potential security issues in Liu's algorithm. However, Wang and Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] proposed a novel approach to color image encryption that utilizes a combination of heterogeneous bit permutation and correlated chaos techniques. A new bit-level image ciphering method proposed by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] is based on PWLCMs. First, the ordinary image is transformed into two binary sequences of the same size. Second, a new diffusion strategy is introduced to mutually diffuse the two sequences. Niyat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] proposed an image ciphering method based on a self-organized structure with a set of units updated according to rules that depend on the number of limited neighboring units. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] presented a solution for protected and efficient image ciphering using adaptive permutation-diffusion and random DNA coding, where the permutation and diffusion procedures are perturbed by the intrinsic characteristics of the plaintext. However, Ye and Huang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] proposed an efficient symmetric image ciphering technique to resolve the low-sensitivity issue of an ordinary image. Recently, Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] developed an enhanced digital image ciphering method using a collage model and a one-dimensional quadratic chaotic system, thus expanding the key space that offers robust resilience against exhaustive attacks. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] proposed an improved 3D chaotic system characterized by various dynamic behaviors, such as phase shifts and expansion and contraction phenomena that vary with parameter changes. The proposed model covers a wide chaotic range and demonstrates its applicability in image encryption processes. Hence, a color image ciphering method based on a hypercomplex chaotic system and a skew tent map was proposed by Kadir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>] proposed a new color image ciphering method based on DNA, one-time keys, spatiotemporal chaos and sequence operations. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] proposed a quantum image ciphering scheme based on permutation using an improved quantum representation model and realized consecutive intraputation by sorting an interpermutation and chaotic sequence operations involving the qubit XOR process between chosen bit planes. However, Winarno et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>] proposed a combination of several intertwined patterns, incorporating zigzag, Hilbert, and Morton patterns, to aggregate confusion-diffusion and improve complexity and randomness. Thus, Aung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] proposed a poly-alphabetic cipher that constitutes a new system for encrypting and decrypting data.</p><p>The mentioned systems generally use small-size substitution tables, namely 16×16, which constitute a simple permutation that does not influence the statistical distribution of pixels. This leads to vulnerability to statistical attacks. Additionally, the replacement functions are defined by simple analytical expressions. Similarly, techniques using genetic algorithms operating at the DNA level typically exhibit a static notation, such as the conversion from Z/4Z to DNA.</p><p>The new trends in the field of symmetric cryptography involve the use of genetic algorithms through the application of specific genetic operators adapted to the encryption of voluminous data, typically acting at the level of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA). On the other hand, researchers are attempting to utilize Euclidean networks for symmetric encryption of textual data.</p><p>The contribution of this study lies in overcoming all anomalies indicated in prior research and developing a new image encryption cryptosystem using two large substitution tables of sizes (256; 256), accompanied by dynamic affine functions for diffusion restoration. Furthermore, the size of the private key in the cryptosystem far exceeds 100 bits, placing the new technique beyond the reach of any differential attacks.</p>

          <p>The classical affine transformation is static and thus remains vulnerable to any brute-force attack. The shortcomings of traditional Vigenère and affine systems have been previously outlined in this study. To overcome all these flaws, substitution tables of large size are used, specifically 256×256, generated from pseudorandom vectors employing new replacement and diffusion functions involving more than one S-box. Similarly, the affine functions used are dynamic and pseudorandom.</p>

      <p>All simulations were executed using Python on the Windows 10 operating system, employing a hardware setup comprising an i7 processor laptop with a 1 TB hard drive and 32 GB of RAM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> displays the main test image, “Lena,” along with its encrypted and decrypted versions, as well as all plain images utilized. These image samples were sourced from the SIPI database (https://sipi.usc.edu/database/). The keys and various experimental parameters are generated using the previously described chaotic maps. Before commencing the decryption process, it is imperative to securely transmit the secret key to the recipient through a protected channel.</p>

              <p>Histograms depict the distribution of pixel values in images. Unauthorized individuals could extract crucial details about an encrypted image by analyzing its irregular histogram. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that encrypted image histograms exhibit no numerical similarity with the original image, and maintain a consistent pixel distribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref> showcase histograms of all test images, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_14">Figure 14</xref> displays histograms of images generated through encryption for each corresponding test image. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> specifically illustrates the histogram of the main test image “Lena.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref> represent RGB channel histograms of clear images, whereas Subgraphs (a)-(j) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_14">Figure 14</xref> portray RGB channel histograms of encrypted images using the proposed method.

Examination of the data in the table reveals markedly elevated variances in the unencrypted images, in contrast to significantly lower variances in the encrypted versions. Specifically, the mean variance for the encrypted “Lena” image was 223.667, in comparison to 81232.023 for its plaintext counterpart. A comparative analysis further indicates that, for most of the tested images, the histogram variances in encrypted images generated using the proposed method consistently surpassed those obtained by several researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. This comparative evidence supports the claim that the proposed algorithm has an improved capability to enhance the security of the encryption process.</p>

Examination of the table data indicates a remarkably high correlation in the original image, approaching a value of 1 for each channel. In contrast, images encrypted with the proposed algorithm exhibit a significantly lower correlation. This observation supports the robust security achieved by the algorithm. Moreover, these results highlight a considerable decrease in correlation within the encrypted image, indicating that attackers cannot extract information from the encrypted image using this method.</p>

              <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> displays the pixel correlations detected within the 'Lena' image. A juxtaposition with previous techniques reveals that the mutual correlation of adjacent pixels in the encrypted image is lower than that in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], although it is similar to that in the study of Butt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. The correlation metrics for all tested image correlations by the proposed encryption system are nearly zero, providing protection against statistical attacks.</p>

              <p>The information in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> reveals UACI and NPCR values for two images, “Lena” and “Pepper”. It illustrates that the UACI is equal to or exceeds 33.4, and the NPCR is equal to or exceeds 99.6. These results unequivocally demonstrate that the NPCR performance of the suggested encryption algorithm is on par with that of the algorithm proposed by Butt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] and surpasses that of several other algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Meanwhile, the UACI value aligns closely with that of several algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. This indicates that the proposed approach showcases robust encryption performance, particularly in thwarting differential attacks.</p>

              <p>In the field of image processing, the mean squared error (MSE) and PSNR are widely used to assess the effectiveness of encryption. These metrics serve as common criteria for evaluating the quality of two images in a cryptographic system. The PSNR gauges the similarity between images and complements the MSE. Eq. (10) can be applied to calculate the MSE for the original, decrypted, and encrypted images.</p>

              <p>A higher PSNR indicates a smaller difference between the original and decrypted images. When the original and encrypted images are identical, the PSNR becomes infinite. The table below presents a comparison of PSNR values between the proposed approach and other references.</p><p>The lower PSNR values observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref> for the original-to-encrypted images suggest that the proposed algorithm offers superior encryption compared to the methods in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. The metric's value is comparable to that in the study of Aung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], indicating that the proposed method can recover images without substantial information loss.</p>

            <title>6.1. Advantages</title>
          
          <p>The method has several benefits, namely:</p><p>• Difficulty to recover encryption keys due to the extreme sensitivity of the used chaotic maps to the initial conditions. </p><p>• Robustness of the method due to non-commutative algebraic operations.</p><p>• The system can be applied to any image of arbitrary format and size.</p><p>• Use of pseudo-random and bijective affine functions.</p><p>• High attack complexity of the method due to the replacement S-box design under a chaotic decision control vector.</p><p>• Difficulty of S-box reconstruction due to their pseudorandom vector-based construction.</p>

            <title>6.2. Limitations</title>
          
          <p>The effectiveness of the approach is predominantly influenced by the constraints imposed by the selection of chaotic maps, the design of S-boxes, and the pseudo-random characteristics of the generated S-boxes.</p>

      <title>7. Conclusions</title>
      <p>A hybrid circuit combining the affine and Vigenere techniques was applied, employing two novel substitution tables and a robust diffusion and confusion function, followed by a global permutation tailored for image encryption. Additionally, the incorporation of highly sensitive chaotic maps into the initial conditions allowed us to suggest an improved method for ciphering color images. Simulations conducted on a randomly selected sample of images from the SIPI database, featuring various formats and sizes, demonstrated the algorithm's ability to withstand any known attacks.</p><p>As a perspective, some algorithms will be integrated with the proposed method, such as wavelet transformations, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and fuzzy methods.</p>
