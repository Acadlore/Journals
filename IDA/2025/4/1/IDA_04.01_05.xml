      <abstract><p>The accurate segmentation of visual data into semantically meaningful regions remains a critical task across diverse domains, including medical diagnostics, satellite imagery interpretation, and automated inspection systems, where precise object delineation is essential for subsequent analysis and decision-making. Conventional segmentation techniques often suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to noise, intensity inhomogeneity, and weak boundary definition, resulting in reduced performance under complex imaging conditions. Although fuzzy set-based approaches have been proposed to improve adaptability under uncertainty, they frequently fail to maintain a balance between segmentation precision and robustness. To address these challenges, a novel segmentation framework was developed based on Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PyFSs) and local averaging, offering enhanced performance in uncertain and heterogeneous visual environments. By incorporating both membership and non-membership degrees, PyFSs allow a more flexible representation of uncertainty compared to classical fuzzy models. A local average intensity function was introduced, wherein the contribution of each pixel was adaptively weighted according to its PyFS membership degree, improving resistance to local intensity variations. An energy functional was formulated by integrating PyFS-driven intensity constraints, local statistical deviation measures, and regularization terms, ensuring precise boundary localization through level set evolution. Convexity of the energy formulation was analytically demonstrated to guarantee the stability of the optimization process. Experimental evaluations revealed that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing fuzzy and non-fuzzy segmentation algorithms, achieving superior accuracy in applications such as medical image analysis and natural scene segmentation. These results underscore the potential of PyFS-based models as a powerful and generalizable solution for uncertainty-resilient image segmentation in real-world applications.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In both computer vision and applied mathematics, a core challenge lies in partitioning an image into separate, interpretable regions that represent various objects or surfaces within the visual context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Accurate segmentation is essential for various downstream tasks, such as object recognition and scene understanding. Over the years, a wide range of methods have been proposed for image partitioning, thus reflecting the importance of this task in areas such as medical-imaging, remote-sensing, and autonomous driving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. One widely adopted technique involves active contour models (ACMs) implemented through the level-set method, which have gained significant attention in recent years, thereby offering a balance between simplicity and robustness. These models can be broadly classified into two main types: edge-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] and region-based segmentation models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>Edge-based active contours are driven by gradient information, thereby guiding the contour towards object boundaries. While effective in well-structured images, they are highly sensitive to noise and often struggle with weak or poorly defined boundaries. In contrast, region-based ACMs leverage the statistical information of regions rather than relying on gradients. This makes them more resilient in complex scenarios, where noise or weak boundaries pose significant challenges. By using information from larger regions of the image, region-based methods can often achieve more reliable and accurate segmentation, making them a preferred choice in many applications.</p><p>Among region-based methods, the level-set variational technique introduced by Chan and Vese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] has been highly influential due to its elegant design and efficiency in segmenting images into two consistent intensity regions. Despite its strength in handling homogeneity, the C-V model struggles in the presence of noise or when an intensity inhomogeneity exists across regions. As a result, segmentation in such challenging environments becomes more difficult, as the model cannot fully adapt to variations in the image intensity, thus often leading to suboptimal results.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, deep learning-based image segmentation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with various models addressing key challenges in object detection and scene analysis. Minaee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] conducted a comprehensive survey on deep learning-based segmentation techniques, highlighting the evolution from traditional methods to modern architectures such as fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Net, Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), and Transformer-based models. These deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in diverse applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and autonomous systems. However, despite their success, these models require extensive labeled datasets, substantial computational resources, and often lack interpretability, making their deployment challenging in real-time applications. Similarly, Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] reviewed existing image segmentation approaches and categorized them into classical, hybrid, and deep learning-based techniques. Their work emphasized the strengths of deep learning models in achieving high segmentation accuracy but also pointed out critical challenges such as domain adaptability, annotation dependency, and robustness against noise and occlusions.</p><p>To further refine segmentation performance, Zhang and Liu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] introduced a customized Segment Anything Model (SAM) approach tailored for interpreting medical visuals. This method draws strength from general-purpose models trained on extensive datasets and prompt-based learning, enabling efficient and adaptive segmentation across multiple medical imaging modalities. While SAM has shown potential in handling complex anatomical structures with minimal retraining, its primary limitation lies in its difficulty in dealing with low-contrast images and domain-specific noise. In a similar effort, Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] proposed a novel segmentation framework that utilizes in-context examples to guide the segmentation process, reducing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. This approach improves generalization and adaptability while maintaining computational efficiency. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of the in-context examples, and it may struggle in highly variable or unseen data distributions. These studies collectively illustrate the advancements and ongoing challenges in the field, emphasizing the need for more robust and generalizable segmentation frameworks.</p><p>Existing image segmentation models, including ACMs, deep learning-based approaches, and foundation models like SAM, have significantly advanced the field by improving accuracy and adaptability. However, they still face notable limitations. Edge-based ACMs struggle with noise and weak boundaries, while region-based models like the C-V model often fail in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity. Deep learning methods such as U-Net and Mask R-CNN offer high accuracy but require extensive labeled datasets and large computational resources and often lack interpretability. Similarly, SAM introduces a prompt-based segmentation approach that enhances adaptability but suffers from domain-specific challenges such as low contrast and high noise, limiting its effectiveness in complex medical and remote sensing images. Liu et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] in-context learning model attempts to improve generalization, but its success heavily depends on the availability and quality of prior examples, making it unreliable for highly variable datasets.</p><p>To address these challenges, a novel image segmentation model based on PyFSs and local averaging was proposed in this study, which enhances robustness against noise and intensity variations. Unlike conventional fuzzy methods, PyFSs provide a more flexible framework for uncertainty representation by incorporating membership <inline-formula>

      <p>This additional degree of freedom allows for a more refined treatment of uncertainty, thereby improving the reliability of segmentation in complex imaging scenarios. A fundamental distinction between PyFSs and Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (IFSs) lies in their underlying mathematical structure and the flexibility afforded in handling uncertainty. In IFSs, the relationship between membership and non-membership degrees is constrained by the additive condition <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, which enables a broader and more adaptive modeling of uncertainty. This characteristic is particularly advantageous in image segmentation tasks where noise and intensity inhomogeneity must be effectively addressed. The enhanced representational capacity of PyFSs allows for more precise boundary delineation, improved robustness against noise, and greater adaptability in complex visual environments.</p><p>The local averaging component in the proposed model ensures robust boundary preservation and smooth segmentation. Unlike conventional averaging techniques, a PyFS-based weighted averaging approach was employed in this study, where the influence of each pixel is adaptively determined based on its membership degree. This strategy facilitates effective noise suppression while enhancing contrast, thereby mitigating the limitations of ACMs, which often struggle with stable contour evolution and intensity inhomogeneity in region-based models. Furthermore, in comparison to fuzzy logic-based segmentation models, the proposed approach offers a more refined uncertainty representation and enhanced adaptability. Traditional fuzzy logic-based segmentation techniques rely on fixed membership functions and predefined rules, which can be less effective in handling complex intensity variations and noise. In contrast, PyFSs introduce a more flexible and mathematically robust framework that dynamically adjusts uncertainty measures based on local image characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). This results in improved segmentation precision, particularly in challenging scenarios where standard fuzzy logic approaches may struggle with over-segmentation or loss of fine details.</p><p>By integrating PyFSs and localized averaging, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance over traditional and deep learning-based segmentation techniques, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by noise, intensity inhomogeneity, and computational constraints. The incorporation of an uncertainty-driven decision-making mechanism enhances segmentation precision, positioning the proposed framework as a robust alternative to existing methodologies in complex imaging tasks. Moreover, the proposed model is inherently convex, ensuring stability and convergence during optimization. The convexity property is instrumental in reinforcing the robustness of the model by guaranteeing a unique global solution and mitigating the risk of local minima—a prevalent limitation in traditional segmentation techniques. These attributes collectively make the proposed methodology highly suitable for real-world applications, where reliability, stability, and computational efficiency are of paramount importance.</p><p>This study is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related works in the field. Section 3 introduces the proposed segmentation model, including a detailed derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equation and its discretization. Section 4 presents the experimental results using various datasets and compares the accuracy of the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, Section 5 offers the concluding remarks on this study.</p>

      <title>2. Related work</title>
      <p>Fuzzy logic-based segmentation models have demonstrated significant potential in addressing the challenges of noisy and inhomogeneous images by leveraging their ability to handle uncertainty and imprecision. According to Derevyanchuk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], smart fuzzy-based segmentation techniques have been investigated for their role in enhancing engineering education and pedagogical specialists, emphasizing their role in enhancing analytical and decision-making skills. The model employs fuzzy inference mechanisms to classify and segment images based on varying intensity distributions, making it adaptable to diverse datasets. One of its major achievements is the improvement of boundary detection, particularly in cases where traditional threshold-based segmentation fails due to noise interference. However, the model struggles with highly inhomogeneous images where subtle intensity variations can lead to misclassifications. The segmentation accuracy drops in cases where regions exhibit low contrast, requiring additional enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization or adaptive filtering to improve performance.</p><p>Narasimham and Keshav Kumar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] introduced a fuzzy logic-based system (FLBS) specifically designed for object detection and classification, which integrates fuzzy membership functions to enhance segmentation robustness. This approach effectively reduces the impact of noise and artifacts commonly present in medical images, ensuring a more reliable delineation of tumor regions. The primary achievement of this model is its ability to maintain high classification accuracy while dealing with intensity variations caused by factors such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisition settings and patient-specific tissue characteristics. The incorporation of fuzzy rules allows for more flexible segmentation compared to conventional edge-detection or region-growing methods. However, a notable limitation of this approach is its performance in highly inhomogeneous brain tissues where overlapping intensity distributions can lead to segmentation inaccuracies. In such cases, the fuzzy system may struggle to differentiate between tumor boundaries and healthy tissues, necessitating the integration of deep learning-based refinement techniques or hybrid machine learning-fuzzy models to enhance precision.</p><p>Tran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] proposed an automatic segmentation model for detecting masses in mammograms using fuzzy logic, integrated within an intelligent system for medical imaging. This model benefits from the adaptability of fuzzy clustering techniques, which enable the identification of mass boundaries even in noisy and low-contrast mammographic images. The key strength of this approach lies in its ability to enhance lesion detection sensitivity while reducing false positives, making it a valuable tool for early breast cancer diagnosis. The model effectively mitigates noise interference by incorporating fuzzy-based decision-making strategies that refine mass localization. However, in cases of extreme inhomogeneity, where dense breast tissues overlap with malignant regions, the segmentation process encounters challenges. The presence of overlapping textures and varying tissue densities can cause the model to incorrectly classify normal regions as masses or vice versa. To overcome this, advanced hybrid methods incorporating deep learning or statistical feature extraction could be employed to improve segmentation accuracy and ensure better clinical applicability.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, a novel image segmentation approach based on PyFSs and local averaging was proposed in this study. The proposed model leverages the flexibility of PyFSs to handle uncertainty and vagueness in image segmentation, providing a more robust framework for processing noisy and inhomogeneous images. By incorporating local averaging, the proposed method enhances the preservation of fine details while effectively smoothing out noise, ensuring better segmentation accuracy in complex scenarios. Unlike conventional fuzzy logic-based methods, which may struggle with overlapping intensity distributions and low-contrast regions, PyFSs offer an extended membership representation that captures uncertainty more effectively. This enables the model to distinguish subtle variations in image intensity and structure, leading to improved delineation of object boundaries. The integration of local averaging further refines segmentation results by reinforcing spatial coherence, making the proposed approach highly suitable for applications such as medical imaging, satellite analysis, and industrial quality control, where accurate segmentation is essential.</p>

</inline-formula> is a crucial component for robust image segmentation, particularly in the presence of noise and intensity inhomogeneities. Instead of using a standard averaging mechanism, Pythagorean fuzzy membership degrees were incorporated to control the contribution of each pixel in the local region. This approach enhances segmentation accuracy by dynamically weighting each neighboring pixel based on its membership in the target region.</p>

      <title>4. Experimental results</title>
      <p>This section presents the results obtained from evaluating the proposed PyFS-based segmentation model. The model was tested on both real and synthetic images to analyze its effectiveness in handling noise and intensity variations. The dataset used in the experiments is the Berkeley Dataset. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a subset of 50 images with varying levels of noise and intensity inhomogeneity was selected. For a comprehensive assessment, the proposed approach was compared with three existing segmentation techniques: the FLBS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] and the approach developed by Tran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. These comparisons were performed on images affected by noise and intensity inhomogeneity to examine segmentation robustness. The experimental setup and evaluation metrics used to validate segmentation accuracy, noise suppression, and boundary preservation are detailed in the subsequent sections. To maintain consistency across all experiments, a local neighborhood window of $5 \times 5<inline-formula>

      <p>To assess the performance of the proposed model, a comprehensive set of statistical experiments was conducted. Various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), were employed to measure segmentation quality. The findings demonstrated that the proposed model consistently outperformed baseline methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving high levels of noise.</p>

      <p>The experimental outcomes validate the effectiveness of the PyFS-based model, demonstrating its superiority in handling noise, maintaining boundary precision, and achieving stable segmentation results under varying conditions. Comparative analysis confirms that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> presents a comparative analysis of segmentation results obtained using the FLBS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], the approach developed by Tran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], and the proposed model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling intensity inhomogeneity while achieving accurate and consistent segmentation results. The figure consists of three sets of images, each demonstrating the segmentation performance under different intensity inhomogeneity conditions. The red contours indicate the segmented regions obtained by each model. The results highlight the superior performance of the proposed model in accurately delineating object boundaries despite variations in intensity distribution. In contrast, the FLBS model and the approach developed by Tran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] exhibit significant limitations. The FLBS model struggles with intensity inhomogeneity, leading to incomplete or fragmented segmentation results, particularly in regions where object boundaries blend with the background. Similarly, the approach developed by Tran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] fails to maintain boundary consistency, producing irregular and inaccurate contours in the presence of noise and varying intensity levels. These shortcomings emphasize the inability of the competing models to adapt to complex imaging conditions. In contrast, the proposed model effectively handles these challenges, producing smooth and well-defined contours, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in achieving consistent segmentation performance.</p>
      <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting images corrupted by varying levels of Gaussian noise. The first row presents the original image, followed by three progressively degraded versions with Gaussian noise at variance levels of 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively. As the noise intensity increases, the image becomes increasingly distorted, making accurate segmentation more challenging. The second row displays the segmentation results obtained using the proposed model. Despite the increasing noise levels, the model consistently delineates the object’s boundaries with high accuracy, as indicated by the red contours. This demonstrates the robustness of the proposed approach in handling noisy conditions, effectively preserving structural details and outperforming traditional segmentation methods that often struggle with noise-induced distortions.</p>

      <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the segmentation performance of the proposed model under different noise levels. The figure demonstrates how the model consistently produces accurate segmentation results despite variations in noise intensity. The red contours represent the detected object boundaries, which remain stable and well-defined across different conditions. Unlike traditional segmentation methods that often fail in the presence of high noise, the proposed model maintains its robustness by effectively preserving object structures. The results further emphasize the convex nature of the proposed approach, as the segmentation remains unaffected by changes in initialization and noise levels. This consistency highlights the model’s adaptability and reliability in handling complex images with intensity inhomogeneity and significant noise interference, making it a superior choice for real-world segmentation tasks.</p>

          <p>To comprehensively evaluate the segmentation performance of the proposed model against competing methods, several standard metrics were utilized, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, IoU, DSC, MCC, and computational time (CPU). These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of segmentation quality.</p><p>Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the segmentation by computing the ratio of correctly classified pixels (both foreground and background) to the total number of pixels.

The proposed model achieves the highest accuracy (95.0%), precision (93.5%), and recall (91.8%), indicating its ability to accurately classify segmented regions while minimizing false positives and false negatives. Additionally, the F1-score (94.1%) and IoU (90.4%) demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in achieving high-quality segmentation results with minimal overlap errors. The Dice coefficient (92.3%) and MCC (91.8%) further validate the robustness of the proposed method in maintaining segmentation consistency.</p><p>In contrast, the FLBS model and the approach developed by Tran et al.

The FLBS model exhibits lower accuracy (85.4%) and recall (80.2%), indicating its difficulty in correctly identifying segmented regions, particularly in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity and noise. Similarly, the approach developed by Tran et al.

This efficiency advantage demonstrates that the proposed method not only improves segmentation accuracy but also reduces computational overhead, enhancing its applicability in practical, real-world scenarios.</p><p>Overall, these results confirm that the proposed model outperforms the competing methods in accuracy and all other efficiency, making it a more reliable and computationally efficient choice for segmentation tasks in complex imaging conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>).

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this study, a PyFS-based segmentation model was proposed, which effectively addressed intensity inhomogeneity and noise by integrating fuzzy membership-based local averaging and an adaptive energy functional. The model demonstrated robustness against noise, weak edges, and intensity variations, leading to improved segmentation accuracy in challenging imaging conditions. This approach has potential applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial defect detection. The code is available for research purposes upon request via email.</p><p>Despite its advantages, the proposed model has certain limitations. The integration of PyFSs requires iterative updates of membership functions, making the segmentation process computationally intensive, particularly for high-resolution images. Additionally, the performance depends on hyperparameter selection, such as fuzzy weighting coefficients and neighborhood size, which require fine-tuning for different datasets. Another limitation is the trade-off between edge preservation and smoothing, where the local averaging mechanism may slightly blur sharp edges, affecting fine boundary details.</p><p>Future research could focus on enhancing the multi-target segmentation capabilities of the proposed PyFS-based model by integrating attention mechanisms. Attention-based techniques can improve the model’s ability to selectively focus on relevant image regions, thereby refining segmentation accuracy in complex scenes. Additionally, the integration of PyFSs with transformer networks and graph-based models could be explored to improve generalization across diverse imaging modalities. To further optimize computational efficiency, future work could also investigate advanced numerical solvers and automated parameter selection using machine learning techniques. These advancements aim to enhance the scalability and robustness of the proposed model for real-world applications.</p>
