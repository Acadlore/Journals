      <abstract><p>This study critically investigates the strategic transformation of South Korea’s entrepreneurial ecosystem within the broader trajectory of national economic modernization and innovation-centric development. The principal objective is to understand how coordinated governmental strategies, targeted institutional reforms, and private sector alignment have collectively redefined entrepreneurship as a structural pillar of economic advancement. Drawing upon a synthesis of longitudinal economic data, comparative policy frameworks, and a refined production function incorporating entrepreneurship as a distinct variable, the research adopts a multidisciplinary lens. It evaluates key dynamics such as venture investment flows, research and development spending, and startup proliferation between 2005 and 2024. Through the construction of a comprehensive entrepreneurship performance index and the estimation of an entrepreneurship-augmented growth model, the analysis captures both the macroeconomic contribution and the policy effectiveness behind Korea’s startup landscape. The findings underscore that entrepreneurship in Korea functions not as a peripheral activity but as an embedded mechanism for addressing core economic vulnerabilities, including demographic contraction, employment mismatches, and structural dependence on large conglomerates. The paper concludes that Korea’s model, characterized by institutional agility and strategic foresight, offers instructive insights for nations navigating post-industrial transitions. Its broader significance lies in demonstrating how entrepreneurship, when interwoven into national policy, education systems, and regional development, can serve as a lever for sustainable competitiveness. Rather than offering a universal blueprint, the Korean experience presents a flexible framework adaptable to diverse socio-economic contexts, especially in emerging and resource-transitioning economies.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the 21st century global economy, the ability of nations to foster innovation-led entrepreneurship has emerged as a key determinant of sustainable growth, competitiveness, and economic diversification. South Korea stands out as a particularly illuminating case: a country that, within a few decades, transformed itself from a war-ravaged agrarian society into one of the world’s leading innovation economies. While much attention has been paid to its technological achievements, less discussed—but equally critical—is the strategic evolution of its entrepreneurship ecosystem as a driver of inclusive and innovation-intensive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Amsden, 1989</xref>).</p><p>This paper examines the economic underpinnings and policy dynamics of South Korea’s entrepreneurship development, focusing on the deliberate interplay between public sector steering and private sector responsiveness. We argue that Korea’s entrepreneurial success was not a product of spontaneous market forces but a carefully orchestrated outcome of multi-layered institutional reform, targeted financial engineering, and deep integration of entrepreneurship into the country’s broader economic planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Cho &amp;amp; Kim, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Kim, 1976</xref>).</p><p>The study also develops a quantitative lens to measure the impact of entrepreneurship on economic growth through an extended Cobb-Douglas production function, incorporating entrepreneurship as a distinct factor of production:</p>

      <title>2. Institutional evolution of entrepreneurship in south korea</title>
      <p>South Korea’s entrepreneurial ecosystem did not emerge through spontaneous market liberalization but through sustained, state-driven institution building. Following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Korean policymakers recognized the vulnerability of their economy’s overdependence on large conglomerates (chaebols) and initiated structural reforms aimed at fostering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups. These efforts were not merely economic; they were strategic responses to globalization, digital disruption, and demographic shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Haggard &amp;amp; Mo, 2000</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.1. Legal and policy infrastructure</title>
          
          <p>The formalization of entrepreneurship policy began with the enactment of the Framework Act on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and the Venture Business Act in the late 1990s. These legislative instruments laid the foundation for a comprehensive support system encompassing tax relief, financing incentives, and R&amp;amp;D assistance.</p><p>Key policy instruments included:</p><p>• Credit guarantee schemes via the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KODIT),</p><p>• Tax deductions for venture investments and early-stage companies,</p><p>• Patent commercialization support through the Korea Intellectual Property Office (KIPO),</p><p>• Startup visas for foreign entrepreneurs and returnee scientists.</p><p>These initiatives were complemented by a performance-based approach to public support, where government funding and incentives were conditional on startup scalability, employment generation, and innovation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Organisation for Economic Co-operation &amp;amp; Development., 2023</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.2. Organizational architecture and institutional actors</title>
          
          <p>One of the most unique features of Korea’s entrepreneurship ecosystem is the dense network of semi-autonomous, specialized institutions that mediate between the state and market. The most prominent among these include:</p><p>• KISED (Korea Institute of Startup &amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Development): Established in 2008, KISED operates under the Ministry of SMEs and Startups. It manages national startup incubators, accelerator programs, and policy R&amp;amp;D.</p><p>• KVIC (Korea Venture Investment Corporation): Manages the Fund-of-Funds program, mobilizing public and private capital into venture financing.</p><p>• Innopolis Foundation: Focuses on regional innovation and supports university-linked startup clusters in designated "Innopolis Zones" such as Daedeok, Gwangju, and Busan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Kim, 1997</xref>).</p><p>• TIPS (Tech Incubator Program for Startups): A public-private co-investment program were selected incubators match government grants with private investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kvint, 2010</xref>).</p><p>These institutions function within a well-coordinated governance framework. Policy direction is centralized in the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, which acts as a "control tower" ensuring horizontal alignment across ministries and vertical coordination with local governments.</p>

            <title>2.3. Evolution through public-private synergy</title>
          
          <p>Rather than crowding out the private sector, Korean institutions have aimed to de-risk entrepreneurial activity and catalyze private investment. For instance, the Fund-of-Funds mechanism pioneered by KVIC mobilized over $10 billion USD in venture capital between 2005 and 2020, with private matching increasing over time. This model has since been emulated in several other countries, including Israel and Singapore.</p><p>Moreover, the TIPS model—where incubators are selected through competitive calls and required to contribute their own capital—has become a global benchmark for efficient co-financing. Data from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups indicates that startups under TIPS show three times higher survival rates after five years compared to non-supported firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Ministry of SMEs &amp;amp; Startups Republic of Korea., 2024</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.4. Entrepreneurial hubs and spatial strategy</title>
          
          <p>Recognizing the spatial concentration of startups in Seoul, the Korean government adopted a regional innovation approach by designating “Innopolis Zones” linked to local universities and research centers. These hubs offer tax exemptions, discounted office space, and preferential access to R&amp;amp;D grants. They have significantly contributed to the decentralization of entrepreneurial activity, with Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju becoming vibrant regional innovation clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Innopolis Foundation., 2024</xref>).</p>

      <title>3. Empirical insights: entrepreneurship trends and economic indicators in south korea (2005–2024)</title>
      <p>South Korea’s entrepreneurial landscape has undergone a measurable transformation over the past two decades. A combination of institutional scaffolding, financial innovation, and cultural shifts has significantly elevated the country’s capacity for startup generation, innovation output, and venture capital attraction.

          <p>From 2005 to 2024, Korea’s R&amp;amp;amp;D expenditure rose from approximately 2.8% to over 4.5% of GDP, with the private sector contributing more than 75% of total investment. This robust input has fueled patent activity, deep-tech startup formation, and university-industry collaborations. It also signals the integration of entrepreneurial strategy with the national innovation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">World Bank., 2022</xref>).</p>

      <title>4. Strategic policy proposals for korea’s next-generation entrepreneurship ecosystem</title>
      <p>While South Korea’s entrepreneurship ecosystem is globally admired for its depth and dynamism, new global trends—such as climate imperatives, digital decentralization, and demographic shifts—necessitate a policy transition from linear support systems to networked, adaptive entrepreneurship architectures. This section outlines forward-looking policy innovations designed to future-proof Korea’s entrepreneurial model and sustain its economic competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Chekalyuk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Hong et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

            <title>4.1. From subsidy to sovereignty: a national innovation sovereign fund (nisf)</title>
          
          <p>Building on the success of the Fund-of-Funds model, Korea can establish a National Innovation Sovereign Fund (NISF) that transcends sectoral boundaries and operates with long-term investment horizons. Unlike existing short-term venture funds, NISF would:</p><p>• Target mission-driven startups aligned with national strategic technologies (e.g., quantum computing, climate tech, AI governance), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Cho et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>• Invest through a blended capital structure: combining equity, convertible grants, and milestone-based debt,</p><p>• Use impact-weighted metrics (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> offset, social innovation scale) to evaluate ROI,</p><p>• Serve as a countercyclical capital source during market downturns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Yu &amp;amp; Yan, 2014</xref>).</p><p>This model would increase capital efficiency while reducing dependence on short-term venture cycles that often exclude high-impact but slow-scaling startups.</p>

          <p>To address urban concentration and unlock underutilized talent pools, the government can launch Smart Regional Startup Hubs (SReSH) in non-metropolitan areas. These would:</p><p>• Be embedded in local universities and vocational institutes,</p><p>• Offer tax-free zones for deep-tech startups,</p><p>• Use 5G and IoT infrastructure to integrate rural ventures into national supply chains,</p><p>• Operate via blockchain-based e-governance platforms for licensing, mentoring, and funding access.</p><p>Korea can model these hubs on Estonia’s e-Residency framework and India’s Digital Village scheme, combining digital infrastructure with entrepreneurship incentives.</p>

          <p>To ensure long-term sustainability, Korea must deepen its human capital approach by introducing a national framework for Entrepreneurial Intelligence (EI). This would involve:</p><p>• Introducing entrepreneurship as a transversal competency across STEM, humanities, and arts,</p><p>• Mandating experiential entrepreneurship labs in high schools and colleges,</p><p>• Creating a National Mentorship Exchange (NME) connecting retired professionals and diaspora founders with young entrepreneurs,</p><p>• Measuring EI outcomes using psychometric tools and longitudinal startup tracking.</p><p>This reform aligns with UNESCO’s framework on 21st-century competencies and equips students with agency, resilience, and creativity beyond formal business knowledge.</p>

          <p>While Korea’s sandbox model has fostered innovation in fintech and biotech, a second-generation sandbox model should incorporate:</p><p>• Real-time feedback loops from AI-driven compliance engines,</p><p>• Decentralized dispute resolution via smart contracts,</p><p>• Cross-border pilot programs with partner countries,</p><p>• A Sandbox-as-a-Service (SaaS) model enabling private organizations (banks, telecoms, logistics firms) to launch internal testbeds for startups.</p><p>This would position Korea as a global testbed economy, attracting frontier startups seeking early validation in a digitally enabled, legally agile environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Roibu, 2017</xref>).</p>

          <p>Finally, Korea should experiment with meta-governance platforms—hybrid public-private councils empowered to co-design policy in real time. Such platforms would:</p><p>• Include entrepreneurs, policy designers, technologists, and civil society actors,</p><p>• Use scenario planning and system dynamics modeling to anticipate policy spillovers,</p><p>• Operate on open-data principles to build trust and reduce information asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kim, 2022</xref>)</p>

            <title>4.6. Institutional experimentation: meta-governance platforms</title>
          
          <p>Despite its impressive track record of growth and innovation, South Korea’s economy faces a constellation of structural challenges that threaten its long-term dynamism. Among the most prominent are:</p><p>• Demographic contraction, characterized by one of the world’s lowest fertility rates (0.78 in 2023), leading to labor shortages and a shrinking domestic market;</p><p>• Youth unemployment, which remains persistently high despite overall low unemployment rates, reflecting a mismatch between education outputs and labor market demands;</p><p>• Overconcentration of economic power in chaebols, which, while globally competitive, often stifle SME growth and limit market entry for new firms;</p><p>• Export dependency, particularly in semiconductors and electronics, exposing the economy to global supply chain volatility;</p><p>• Stagnant productivity growth in traditional sectors such as construction, retail, and manufacturing outside of high-tech clusters.</p><p>These issues are compounded by rising global economic uncertainty and the accelerating pace of digital transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Wesnita, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To mitigate these risks, entrepreneurship must evolve from a supplementary economic activity into a systemic response mechanism. Startups can address labor market gaps by creating decentralized work models and leveraging automation. Social enterprises and digital platforms can absorb youth talent, especially in underutilized sectors such as elder care, green services, and cultural exports. Moreover, encouraging SMEs to internationalize—beyond dependence on chaebol supply chains—can diversify export capacity and embed Korea more deeply into resilient regional trade ecosystems.</p><p>Policy should thus focus not only on supporting high-growth startups, but also on structurally embedding entrepreneurship as a corrective force against demographic, structural, and geopolitical vulnerabilities.</p>

      <title>5. Green economy in south korea: current state, challenges, and strategic recommendations</title>
      <p>South Korea has made notable strides in transitioning toward a green economy, underscored by its 2050 net-zero carbon pledge and the Green New Deal initiative introduced as part of its COVID-19 economic recovery strategy. The green economy framework encompasses investments in renewable energy, sustainable mobility, eco-friendly buildings, and digital infrastructure supporting carbon mitigation.</p><p>However, significant gaps remain in implementation. As of 2024, over 60% of Korea's energy supply still derives from fossil fuels, and renewable penetration is less than 8%—one of the lowest among OECD countries. Furthermore, environmental regulations are often fragmented across jurisdictions, and green financing remains heavily dependent on government subsidies without sufficient private sector alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Key challenges include:</p><p>• High dependency on coal and liquefied natural gas,</p><p>• Limited adoption of circular economy practices among SMEs,</p><p>• Lack of carbon pricing mechanisms with broad sectoral application,</p><p>• Skill shortages in green technology fields.</p><p>To address these, Korea should pursue the following integrated reforms:</p><p>• Introduce a unified carbon market linked to regional trading systems (e.g., EU ETS or ASEAN offsets),</p><p>• Strengthen public procurement for green innovation and low-carbon technologies,</p><p>• Expand startup incentives in areas like battery storage, hydrogen fuel, and agritech,</p><p>• Create a national green skills strategy that embeds environmental competencies across education and training systems,</p><p>• Leverage entrepreneurial ecosystems to pilot decentralized renewable platforms (e.g., microgrids, solar cooperatives) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Jones &amp;amp; Lee, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The intersection of green growth and entrepreneurship can serve as a new frontier for Korea's sustainable competitiveness, offering scalable models for global green transition. South Korea's model is a flexible framework that can be adapted globally. Embedding entrepreneurship across government, education, and infrastructure ensures resilience and competitiveness.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusion and global relevance of south korea’s entrepreneurial model</title>
      <p>South Korea's trajectory from post-war reconstruction to becoming one of the most dynamic innovation economies is not merely a case study in rapid industrialization—it is an evolving blueprint for entrepreneurship-led economic transformation. At the heart of this success lies a deliberate convergence of institutional vision, coordinated policy execution, and societal adaptation to innovation.</p><p>The empirical evidence presented in this paper illustrates how Korea has not only expanded its entrepreneurial base but also structurally integrated startups into its broader economic planning. From legal reform to financing frameworks, from educational integration to regional innovation ecosystems, entrepreneurship in Korea has matured into a national growth strategy.</p><p>However, as Korea faces demographic decline, export fragility, and economic polarization, it must now upgrade its entrepreneurship infrastructure from one that supports startups to one that systemically solves economic and social problems. The strategic proposals laid out in this paper—ranging from sovereign innovation funds to Entrepreneurial Intelligence (EI) curricula—are intended to move Korea toward a next-generation entrepreneurial state: one that is digital, inclusive, and globally embedded.</p><p>For other countries, particularly those in transition or seeking post-resource diversification, the Korean experience offers multiple lessons:</p><p>• Institutional agility matters. Rather than creating static bureaucracies, Korea invested in adaptive institutions capable of learning and evolving with market needs.</p><p>• Finance follows design. Rather than waiting for markets to mature, Korea designed co-investment models that de-risked entrepreneurial finance while incentivizing private participation.</p><p>• Human capital is catalytic. Korea’s integration of entrepreneurship into education shows that economic resilience begins in classrooms, not just boardrooms.</p><p>• Geography is not destiny. Through strategic spatial policy, Korea activated underutilized regions and created decentralized innovation zones—an approach applicable to many regional economies.</p><p>In summary, Korea’s entrepreneurial model is not a product to replicate, but a framework to adapt. The future of national competitiveness lies not in producing more startups, but in embedding entrepreneurship into the DNA of governance, education, and infrastructure.</p>
