      <abstract><p>The quest for superior wear-resistant coatings has led to significant advancements in laser cladding technology, yet the escalating requirements for durability under operational conditions challenge the efficacy of existing solutions. This investigation delves into the enhancement of wear resistance in coatings through the integration of particle reinforcement phases, identified as a cost-effective strategy for augmenting coating performance. Emphasis is placed on the systematic classification of particle reinforcements and the methodologies employed for their incorporation. The focus is particularly cast on the incorporation of hard and self-lubricating particles into laser-clad wear-resistant coatings, highlighting innovations in particle addition techniques. An examination of the mechanisms through which hard particles—comprising oxides, carbides, nitrides, borides, and their multifaceted compounds—reinforce coatings is presented, delineating the influence of particle content, size, and morphology on wear resistance. Additionally, the paper explores the state of research on the self-lubricating properties imparted by sulfides, fluorides, graphite, and MAX phase particles under varied thermal conditions. A critical analysis of the benefits and limitations associated with the use of hard and self-lubricating particles in the enhancement of coating durability is conducted. This comprehensive review serves not only to elucidate the current landscape of particle-reinforced, laser-clad coatings but also to inform future research directions aimed at developing coatings capable of withstanding high temperatures and exhibiting exceptional hardness. The commitment to leveraging in situ synthesis for the development of these advanced materials underscores the potential for significant breakthroughs in the field of wear-resistant coatings.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Laser cladding technology, following thermal spraying and electroplating, represents another surface modification technique. Its principle is essentially identical to thermal spraying, utilizing a high-density laser as the heat source to melt materials and solidify them on the substrate surface to form a coating. Laser cladding technology first emerged in the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], but due to technological limitations, it did not gain widespread attention until the late 80s and 90s, when it gradually entered the public eye. Today, laser cladding technology is widely applied in surface protection of vulnerable components, rapid repair of worn surfaces, and re-manufacturing of parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although coatings prepared by laser cladding exhibit excellent performance, the increasingly complex conditions of working environments mean that laser-clad coatings can no longer meet performance needs, especially wear-resistant coatings, which must withstand faster speeds and higher temperatures. To meet the wear resistance of coatings under complex conditions, it is often chosen to add particles to enhance the wear resistance of the clad coating. For example, cladding nickel-based coatings reinforced with (Ti, W) C particles on the surface of centrifugal pump impellers eliminates grooving on the impeller surface, reduces wear, and significantly extends the life of the centrifugal pump [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Creating a cobalt-based coating reinforced with WC on the surface of mining picks improves the wear resistance of the pick surface, extending the life of the parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Due to the discontinuous particle reinforcement, material homogeneity, and simplicity of preparation, particle-reinforced coating technology has become an important technique for preparing wear-resistant coatings on components. This article briefly outlines the classification of particle-reinforced wear-resistant coatings and methods of particle addition, focusing on the research of different particles in enhancing the wear resistance of coatings, and summarizes and prospects the development of particle-reinforced coatings’ wear resistance, to promote the development and application of particle reinforcement technology in wear-resistant coatings.</p>

      <title>2. Classification of wear resistance in particle-reinforced coatings</title>
      <p>The common mechanisms of wear resistance enhancement in particle-reinforced coatings include fine grain strengthening, solid solution strengthening, second phase strengthening, and anti-wear strengthening. There are multiple strengthening mechanisms during the process of enhancing the performance of particle-reinforced coatings. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of wear resistance in particle-reinforced coatings shows that the enhancement of wear resistance mainly falls into two categories: wear resistance enhancement and friction reduction enhancement.</p><p>Wear resistance enhancement refers to the ability of the coating to resist deformation after the addition of particles, generally reflected in the enhancement of the coating's hardness to achieve a wear-resistant effect. Friction reduction enhancement refers to the reduction of the coating's surface roughness after the addition of particles, achieving resistance to material removal by reducing frictional forces, thus enhancing the wear resistance of the coating.</p>

    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>3. Methods of particle addition</title>
      <p>The effect of strengthening varies with different methods of particle addition. Currently, there are two main approaches to adding particles: direct addition and in-situ synthesis.</p><p>Direct addition involves directly mixing the reinforcing particles into the cladding powder. This method is simple and convenient, but the reinforcing particles are prone to oxidation with oxygen in the air under the high temperatures of the laser or to react with substances in the powder, reducing the corresponding particle-reinforced phase in the coating. In severe cases, brittle phases may form. To avoid this, particle encapsulation technology is often used to encapsulate the particles, thus preventing melting and decomposition.</p><p>In-situ synthesis utilizes the particle addition technology that fully takes advantage of melting, decomposition, and then reaction, by placing substances that can generate particle-reinforced phases into the cladding powder. During the coating preparation, a reaction occurs to synthesize the reinforcing phase. This technology often results in coatings that have good wettability with the substrate and uniform particle distribution. The drawback is that the control is relatively poor, the content of the reinforcing phase is difficult to control, and the interaction of mixing enthalpy between elements needs to be considered.</p>

TiC, known for its high melting point and hardness, possesses a thermal expansion coefficient compatible with iron-based materials, offering good wettability and interfacial bonding strength with iron-based substrates, making it frequently used as a reinforcing particle for iron-based coatings.

Subsequent research found that the size of SiC particles plays a different role in the wear resistance of the coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Micron-sized silicon carbide is not completely decomposed during the laser cladding process and can act as a hard point to enhance the coating's wear resistance. Nano-sized silicon carbide is completely decomposed, producing high-hardness compounds that increase the hardness of the coating. However, both nano and micron-sized silicon carbide are prone to react with the substrate at high temperatures, and the difference in thermal expansion coefficients can significantly reduce the coating's performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. To address this issue, Zhong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] successfully improved the density of the coating and mitigated interface defects between SiC particles and the substrate by electroless copper plating on <inline-formula>

              <p>(2) TiC</p><p>Ertugrul et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] utilized TiC to reinforce 316L stainless steel composite materials, finding that the hardness enhancement of the TiC-reinforced coating was mainly due to titanium carbide powder dissolving in the austenite, precipitating carbides, and thus increasing the coating hardness by 100 HV. The wear resistance of the coating first increased and then decreased with the addition of TiC. At higher concentrations, TiC tended to agglomerate, leading to cracks forming along the edges of the particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Generally, in-situ synthesis yields better reinforcement effects, but under low power pulse conditions, in-situ synthesized TiC in iron-based coatings was found to be less effective than direct addition. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] discovered that at low power, Fe and Ti react more readily, producing too little TiC to significantly enhance the wear resistance of the clad layer. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] observed the growth pattern of TiC crystals formed by in-situ synthesis of Ti and C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, Ti and C synthesize octahedral TiC crystals that grow and split upon encountering undercooled liquid in the coating. The split crystals continue to grow and split again, eventually forming dendritic TiC structures.

              <p>Commonly used nitride particles for reinforcement include TiN, which is characterized by high hardness, high wear resistance, and high melting point, and is less expensive than WC, making it a promising substitute for WC. Like other hard particles, titanium nitride also decomposes; upon decomposition of TiN, Ti preferentially reacts with C to precipitate TiC hard phases. TiN and TiC particles have good compatibility and low internal stress, meaning that using TiN to reinforce cobalt-based materials actually forms a dual-phase reinforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. Wang and Hu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] utilized the “pre-nitridation + pulsed laser cladding” method to leverage the rapid heating and cooling characteristics of laser cladding, refining large-sized particles to form a novel intrinsic reinforced phase with micro and nano TiN "nested" within each other, improving hardness characteristics more effectively in depth. Comparing coatings made of nano TiN and sub-micron TiN, the morphology of the coatings after friction wear, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, reveals that coatings with nano-level TiN only show shallow grooves left by friction, while those without nano-level TiN reinforcement exhibit plough-shaped grooves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Increasing the content of nano TiN can further refine the coating structure and enhance its hardness, but it can weaken the bonding strength between the hard phase and the surrounding matrix; nano TiN particles may also collide and aggregate in the melt pool, gradually increasing in size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. To address the issue of particle aggregation, laser cladding technology has been combined with ultrasonic technology to form the “ultrasonic-laser cladding technology”. Xia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>] successfully suppressed particle aggregation using this technique, preparing reinforced coatings with fine particles and uniform distribution.</p>
              <p>Research on in-situ synthesis of titanium nitride is scarce. Wang and Hu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] mixed titanium powder with nickel-based alloy and conducted nitridation in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, resulting in a golden-yellow titanium nitride reinforced coating. Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] used titanium powder and aluminum nitride for in-situ synthesis, finding that the shape of synthesized titanium nitride could change from rod-like to particle-like under the influence of powder ratio and laser power. Ding et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>] synthesized titanium nitride reinforced cobalt-based wear resistance using vanadium nitride and titanium powder; after a heat treatment at 650°C for five hours, the coating's grains were refined, and its microhardness was enhanced, improving the wear resistance of the reinforced coating.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>], when using Ti (B, C, N) reinforcing particles, achieved uniform and dense coating structures by adding Mn powder, which encapsulated and dispersed the Ti (B, C, N) compounds evenly with the molten pool flow. The experiments also revealed that Al in the substrate could partially replace titanium, forming Ti(Al)BCN multicomponent solid solutions. The wear resistance of the particle-reinforced coatings was found to be four times higher than that of the titanium alloy.</p><p>The difference in wear resistance of coatings is greatly related to the particle size and uniform distribution of hard particles. The smaller and more uniformly distributed the hard particles, the denser the coating structure and the higher its wear resistance. Although in-situ synthesis may introduce some defects in certain particles, overall, in-situ synthesized hard particle-reinforced wear-resistant coatings tend to have better bonding strength, more uniform distribution, and fewer impurities compared to coated particles and direct additions. Selecting appropriate in-situ synthesis materials to precipitate pure compounds and form metallurgical bonds with the substrate is key to in-situ synthesis. However, this method works well for particles with low melting points, while for high-melting-point particles like titanium boride, the effect of in-situ synthesis is poor, and particle encapsulation techniques yield better results for high-melting-point particles.</p>

          <p>The wear resistance of anti-wear enhanced coatings primarily involves adding self-lubricating particles that can reduce the friction coefficient, thereby diminishing friction and reducing wear. Common self-lubricating particles include sulfides, fluorides, graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, and MAX phase self-lubricating particles.</p>

              <p>Graphite is known for its good lubricating properties, but graphite was not found in the coating structure in in-situ synthesis experiments, as it easily oxidizes or reacts with other substances to form compounds. Ma and Wang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>] used a method of nickel encapsulating graphite to enhance the coating, which not only improved the hardness of the coating but also played a lubricating role, enhancing the coating's wear resistance from two aspects. Currently, white graphite (h-BN) or hexagonal boron nitride is commonly used in laser cladding. Similar to graphite, h-BN easily decomposes during laser cladding, with studies showing that the coating's hardness and wear resistance improve with increasing h-BN content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>]. Wang and Ye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>] utilized high-power laser cladding to encapsulate Ti liquid around h-BN, introducing self-lubricating particles into the coating, but most of the h-BN still decomposed, limiting the self-lubricating effect. Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>] improved the preservation of h-BN self-lubricating particles within the coating and the compatibility between the particles and the Ni base by using nano-nickel encapsulated h-BN.</p>

Generally, self-lubricating particles have lower melting points and decompose easily during laser cladding, but research on in-situ synthesis and particle encapsulation technologies is significantly less developed than that on hard particles. Future research on self-lubricating phases could focus more on these areas.</p>

              <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>, whether hard phases or self-lubricating phases, their performance improves after encapsulation. Comparing their hardness, the self-lubricating phase coatings are less hard than the hard phase coatings. In terms of friction coefficients, self-lubricating phases at temperatures of 300°C and 600°C are similar to, or even lower than, the friction coefficients of hard phase coatings at room temperature. From these aspects, a complementary relationship exists between self-lubricating and hard particles, suggesting that leveraging the complementarity between hard and self-lubricating phases could produce high-temperature, high-hardness wear-resistant coatings.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Friction is an inevitable presence in mechanical structures, and in the pursuit of higher speeds, the loss of parts due to wear is becoming increasingly severe. Under the grand scheme of carbon neutrality, wear-resistant coatings will undoubtedly assume their historical mission. Besides improving wear resistance, these coatings must also possess high-temperature resistance to continue playing a role in environmental protection and cost savings. Future research will persistently aim at discovering new materials, but a crucial direction currently is to maximize the performance of existing materials through component design, preparation processes, and structural design.</p><p>(1) Hard particles enhance wear resistance through increased hardness, while friction leads to temperature rises; self-lubricating particles exhibit good lubricity at high temperatures but lack hardness. The performance of hard particles and self-lubricating particles is complementary in these scenarios. Encapsulating self-lubricating particles with hard particles can both increase coating hardness and produce a lubricating effect when friction causes temperatures to rise. Future studies could explore encapsulating self-lubricating particles with hard particles or co-encapsulating both types to prepare coatings that are both high-temperature and high-hardness resistant.</p><p>(2) The uniformity of particle distribution and the shape of the structure play a crucial role in enhancing coating performance. A "plum blossom-shaped" grain distribution can withstand forces from various directions. Particle distribution involves using ultrasonics or magnetic fields to disperse aggregated particles within the cladding layer, achieving a uniform distribution effect. There is no definitive research on the formation of specific grain shapes in coating structures, and control over particle distribution and structure shape remains in the preliminary exploration stage. The shaping and control of particles and structure shapes could become a direction for future research. For example, during the process of powder spraying onto the substrate, particles could be interfered with to melt onto the substrate in a specific arrangement, combined with the heterogeneous nucleation function of particles to control the organizational structure.</p><p>(3) An optimal coating structure can surpass the capabilities of the particle-reinforced coating itself. Current particle-reinforced gradient coatings are prepared based on the amount of particle addition, resulting in a somewhat simplistic structure that mostly produces a gradient effect. Coating structure design should be based on performance gradients, not merely transitional gradients. Different particle-reinforced coating performances vary; some enhance bonding strength with the substrate, some increase coating hardness, and others enhance coating toughness. Coatings should be designed according to the different wear conditions of the working parts of the coating, arranging the corresponding reinforced coatings to prepare performance gradient coatings.</p>
