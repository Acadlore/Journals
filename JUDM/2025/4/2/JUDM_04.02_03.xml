      <abstract><p>Urban resilience has become a central framework for advancing sustainable development in the context of escalating urban risks. To investigate the role of population density in shaping resilience, panel data from 114 large Chinese cities covering the period 2006–2021 (excluding the COVID-19 years to avoid potential distortions) were analyzed. A multidimensional urban resilience evaluation system was constructed, encompassing five key domains: economy, society, institutions, environment, and infrastructure. Resilience levels were assessed through the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), while a panel threshold regression model was applied to capture potential nonlinearities in the density–resilience relationship. Results demonstrate that urban resilience in China has exhibited a sustained upward trajectory, largely driven by advances in infrastructure provision and economic capacity. However, population density exerts a nonlinear “double-threshold effect”. At low levels of density, the effect on resilience is statistically insignificant; within a medium-density range, a pronounced negative impact emerges, constituting a “medium-density trap”; and at high densities, the adverse effects are attenuated, suggesting that urban systems may gradually adapt to intensified population pressures. This trap is most evident in regional center cities and rapidly developing urban areas, where governance capacity, infrastructure investment, and resource allocation have lagged behind demographic expansion. These findings highlight the stage-dependent vulnerabilities embedded in urbanization processes and indicate that resilience is not solely a function of density itself but also of institutional capacity and infrastructural adequacy. Differentiated governance strategies are therefore required, including targeted improvements in public infrastructure, strengthened institutional and administrative capacities, and the optimization of spatial configurations to accommodate density-specific challenges. By identifying the thresholds at which population density alters resilience trajectories, this study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of urban vulnerability and offers actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance resilience under conditions of rapid urban growth and high-density development.</p></abstract>
