      <abstract><p><span style="color: rgb(30, 30, 30); font-family: Lato, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif">High technology in the field of renewable energy has dominated various aspects of life in this era, especially architecture, by exploiting its potential to produce clean energy. It is a photovoltaic (PV) material that is used to replace traditional building materials in some parts of external buildings, such as the roof, skylights, or facades. It is increasingly used in the construction of new buildings as a main or additional source of electrical power generation to make the buildings self-sufficient in energy supply and thus reducing the costs of materials in external cladding of buildings and constitute an aesthetic design from other. One of the advantages of integrated solar power units, unlike non-integrated systems, is that they are the most common, are an integral part of the design, and are generally a better and more aesthetic combination than other solar options. These advantages led to the rapid development of sustainable sectors of the PV industry. The past decade has opened the door to countless solar photovoltaic (BIPV) buildings and other construction revolutions. In both new projects and renovations, BIPV has proven to be an energy-saving technology for use in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings as well as healthy buildings, and the harmony between sustainable design and nanotechnology assures promising future prospects for the construction industry to achieve sustainable buildings for a better built environment.</p></abstract>
