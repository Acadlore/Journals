      <abstract><p>Urban resilience has become a central framework for advancing sustainable development in the context of escalating urban risks. To investigate the role of population density in shaping resilience, panel data from 114 large Chinese cities covering the period 2006–2021 (excluding the COVID-19 years to avoid potential distortions) were analyzed. A multidimensional urban resilience evaluation system was constructed, encompassing five key domains: economy, society, institutions, environment, and infrastructure. Resilience levels were assessed through the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), while a panel threshold regression model was applied to capture potential nonlinearities in the density–resilience relationship. Results demonstrate that urban resilience in China has exhibited a sustained upward trajectory, largely driven by advances in infrastructure provision and economic capacity. However, population density exerts a nonlinear “double-threshold effect”. At low levels of density, the effect on resilience is statistically insignificant; within a medium-density range, a pronounced negative impact emerges, constituting a “medium-density trap”; and at high densities, the adverse effects are attenuated, suggesting that urban systems may gradually adapt to intensified population pressures. This trap is most evident in regional center cities and rapidly developing urban areas, where governance capacity, infrastructure investment, and resource allocation have lagged behind demographic expansion. These findings highlight the stage-dependent vulnerabilities embedded in urbanization processes and indicate that resilience is not solely a function of density itself but also of institutional capacity and infrastructural adequacy. Differentiated governance strategies are therefore required, including targeted improvements in public infrastructure, strengthened institutional and administrative capacities, and the optimization of spatial configurations to accommodate density-specific challenges. By identifying the thresholds at which population density alters resilience trajectories, this study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of urban vulnerability and offers actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance resilience under conditions of rapid urban growth and high-density development.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Amid rising global risks and increasing urban complexity, urban resilience has become a key indicator for assessing a city’s capacity to achieve sustainable development [1], [2]. It reflects a city’s ability to withstand and recover from disasters and public health crises as well as its adaptability to maintain essential functions under continuous change [3], [4]. As high-density development and compound risks intensify, balancing risk management and functional performance has become a major challenge for urban planning and governance [5].</p><p>Population density is a core structural factor shaping urban resilience, influencing land use patterns, resource allocation, infrastructure capacity, and environmental pressures [6]. Moderate density can enhance infrastructure efficiency, promote social cohesion, and improve resource utilization, strengthening a city's capacity to absorb and adapt to external disturbances [7], [8]. In contrast, excessive density often correlates with higher pollution levels, infrastructure overload, and increased psychological stress from noise and environmental discomfort [9], [10], [11]. Low-density sprawl, on the other hand, is linked to spatial fragmentation, underutilized land, and inefficiencies in public service delivery, which together undermine urban resilience [12].</p><p>Existing studies have indicated that the relationship between population density and urban resilience is not strictly linear; the direction and intensity of this effect may vary significantly across different density intervals [13], [14], [15], implying that threshold effects may exist rather than a simple one-way response pattern. Particularly during the transition from low to high density, differences in systemic pressure and regulatory capacity across different phases may lead to fluctuations in resilience performance. While some research has preliminarily revealed such nonlinear associations, the mechanisms underlying these patterns, especially across different types of cities and density stages, remain underexplored and lack systematic empirical validation.</p><p>Based on this, the study takes 114 prefecture-level and above cities in China as the research sample. It constructs an urban resilience index system covering the five dimensions mentioned above, evaluates resilience levels using the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method, and applies panel regression and threshold regression models to explore the nonlinear effects and underlying mechanisms of population density on urban resilience and its subsystems. The goal is to provide theoretical support and policy recommendations for managing urban population density and advancing resilience-oriented urban development.</p>

      <p>The study of urban resilience has evolved into a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework encompassing five key dimensions: economic, social, environmental, institutional, and infrastructural. Within this framework, population density is a central structural factor influencing all subsystems.</p><p>In the economic system, moderate population density can help optimize resource allocation and promote the effective concentration of production factors, thereby enhancing a city’s capacity to respond to economic fluctuations and external shocks. On one hand, higher density facilitates information exchange and collaboration among firms, stimulating innovation and industrial synergy, which contributes to faster recovery and greater adaptability of the economic system [7], [8], [16]. On the other hand, excessive density may constrain production space, increase operational costs, and intensify pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises, ultimately undermining economic stability and resilience [17].</p><p>In the social system, moderate population density can facilitate neighborhood interaction and the accumulation of social capital, thereby enhancing community-based mutual support and the ability to respond to unexpected events [18]. However, when population concentration is high and spatial distribution is uneven, it may lead to strained public resource allocation and weakened community identity, triggering social isolation, competition for resources, and group tensions, which in turn exacerbate disparities in resilience across communities [19], [20].</p><p>Population density plays a critical role in shaping a city’s capacity to cope with environmental risks by influencing land use patterns, energy consumption structures, and ecological spatial layouts [21], [22]. A moderately high density is more conducive to the deployment of ecological infrastructure such as green transportation systems, centralized energy supply, and rainwater recycling, thereby enhancing urban adaptability to climate change and natural hazards [23]. Despite these benefits, when population density exceeds ecological carrying thresholds, it often intensifies air pollution, urban heat island effects, and green space degradation, weakening urban ecosystems’ self-regulation and recovery capacity [14], [15].</p><p>Higher population density places greater demands on urban institutional systems such as disaster response, public service delivery, and interdepartmental coordination [24]. In densely populated areas, the urgency and complexity of governance often drive improvements in risk early-warning and emergency response mechanisms, thereby enhancing institutional adaptability and responsiveness [25]. Nevertheless, in the absence of effective coordination mechanisms, such complexity can also lead to fragmented administration and delayed policy implementation, ultimately undermining the stability of institutional structures [26].</p><p>Regarding infrastructure resilience, population density is crucial in shaping urban systems’ spatial configuration and emergency response capacity. Densely populated cities are more likely to develop networked and large-scale infrastructure layouts, enhancing the operational efficiency and responsiveness of essential services such as water supply, electricity, transportation, communications, and healthcare [27], [28]. Nevertheless, when density becomes excessive, these systems may face overload risks. The failure of a single critical node can lead to cascading disruptions, exposing vulnerabilities in the overall resilience of urban infrastructure [15].</p><p>In summary, although their emphases differ, domestic and international studies have examined the complex relationship between population density and urban resilience. International research, primarily based on experiences from Europe, North America, and the Middle East, has emphasized the vulnerabilities of high-density cities in relation to public service provision, traffic congestion, and environmental carrying capacity [11], [18]. It has also stressed the importance of infrastructural resilience and ecological restoration in mitigating these risks [19], [23]. By contrast, studies in the Chinese context have focused more on the challenges of rapid urbanization, particularly the lag in public service expansion and governance capacity during the medium-density stage [12], [14]. These differences suggest that the mechanisms through which density shapes resilience in Chinese cities may diverge from those observed in developed economies, owing to distinct developmental trajectories and institutional contexts. Engaging more directly with international scholarship can help to identify the generalizable aspects of the density–resilience relationship, while at the same time underscoring the distinctive significance of the “medium-density trap” as a phenomenon characterizing large Chinese cities.</p>

            <title>3.1. Conceptual definition</title>
          
          <p>In existing studies, the notion of “optimal density” is typically understood as the level of population agglomeration that balances the benefits of concentration with the costs of congestion, thereby maximizing social welfare or economic efficiency [29], [30]. This notion reflects a single-point optimum in terms of static equilibrium. Related to this argument is the concept of the “nonlinear effects of density”, which suggests that the relationship between population density and urban development performance may exhibit an inverted U-shape or segmented pattern, revealing differences in marginal effects across stages [31].</p><p>Against this backdrop, this study introduces the concept of the “medium-density trap” to describe a stage-specific dilemma that may arise as cities evolve from low-density to high-density conditions. Specifically, when population density enters a certain range, cumulative pressures may emerge simultaneously across the economic, social, ecological, infrastructural, and governance dimensions, while the corresponding support and regulatory capacities fail to expand in parallel. As a result, urban resilience may stagnate or even decline. Urban resilience is understood as a multi-dimensional coupled system that encompasses the economic, social, ecological, infrastructural, and institutional domains [2], [32].</p><p>Accordingly, the “medium-density trap” is not equivalent to the single-point notion of “optimal density”, nor is it merely a descriptive reference to the nonlinear form of the density–performance relationship. Rather, it emphasizes a cross-dimensional zone of systemic vulnerability. The purpose of introducing this concept is to provide a theoretical reference for subsequent empirical analysis and policy discussion. In this sense, the concept differentiates itself from “optimal density” and “nonlinear effects” and offers a new explanatory framework for identifying stage-specific vulnerabilities in urban development.</p>

            <title>3.2. Mechanism of influence</title>
          
          <p>The impact of population density on urban resilience is not unidirectional or linear, and its mechanisms vary across different density stages. Based on existing studies and theoretical reasoning, the potential pathways can be understood through three stages: low density, medium density, and high density.</p><p>In the low-density stage, the concentration of population and economic activities is limited, and economies of scale and network externalities are not yet fully realized. Public services and infrastructure utilization remain relatively inefficient, and governance demands are modest. As a result, the relationship between density and resilience is relatively weak.</p><p>As density increases, cities enter the medium-density stage. At this stage, agglomeration effects emerge, but congestion, environmental stress, and governance challenges also intensify. Public service demand grows faster than supply expansion, infrastructure systems approach their capacity limits, pollution and heat island effects accumulate, and governance complexity rises. The convergence of these pressures may heighten systemic vulnerability, leading to what can be termed the “medium-density trap”. Thus, the medium-density stage may be associated with greater fragility in urban resilience. This theoretical reasoning provides a framework for subsequent empirical analysis.</p><p>Some cities may gradually mitigate density-related pressures in the high-density stage through long-term investments and institutional development. Infrastructure redundancy, public service maturity, ecological restoration, and governance capacity improvements can help moderate negative impacts. However, these outcomes are not universal and depend on resource endowments, governance capacity, and developmental trajectories.</p>

            <title>3.3. Insights from the environmental kuznets curve</title>
          
          <p>The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) posits an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship between economic development and environmental quality. In the early stages of development, environmental quality tends to decline as economic growth accelerates. Once development reaches a certain level, environmental quality may gradually improve [33]. This theory reflects the stage-based logic of “agglomeration effects–congestion effects–institutional catch-up” during development.</p><p>A similar perspective can be applied to the relationship between population density and urban resilience. In the low-density stage, the effects of density may remain limited. In the medium-density stage, pressures from resource constraints and environmental degradation, combined with institutional lag, may become more pronounced. In the high-density stage, some cities may alleviate negative impacts through governance improvements and technological advancement. This nonlinear and stage-specific framework provides important theoretical insights for interpreting the “medium-density trap”. Moreover, the concept of the “middle-income trap” in development economics also highlights the risk of stage-specific stagnation [34], offering a useful analogy for understanding potential dilemmas in spatial agglomeration.</p>

          <p>Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following hypotheses:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Population density and urban resilience may exhibit a nonlinear relationship, with heterogeneous marginal effects across different density stages.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: In the low-density stage, the impact of population density on urban resilience may be relatively weak. In the medium-density stage, population density may exert negative effects on resilience, while in the high-density stage, these effects may be moderated.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Population density influences urban resilience through multiple mechanisms, including economic, social, ecological, infrastructural, and institutional dimensions. The “medium-density trap” may represent the outcome of these pressures converging at a specific stage.</p>

            <title>4.2. Variable design and measurement</title>
          
          <p>The dependent variable is urban resilience (UR). Based on the indicator system described above, we first standardize all indicator data and then apply the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method to calculate the indicator weights. The comprehensive UR score for each city is obtained by aggregating the weighted indicators. The weights and attributes of each indicator are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The core explanatory variable is population density (PD). It refers to the number of permanent residents per unit of land area. Considering that the resilience indicators are measured at the city level, and to ensure consistency in statistical scope, this study adopts the internationally accepted method: PD is calculated as the ratio of the year-end permanent population within the administrative boundary of a city to the total land area.</p><p>Control variables (CVs). Drawing on previous studies [35], [37], this study includes a set of control variables to account for the potential influence of government policy, economic structure, and market conditions on the relationship between population density and urban resilience. Specifically, four control variables are selected: financial investment (FI), measured by the ratio of general government fiscal expenditure to the city’s GDP; industrial structure (IS), represented by the proportion of tertiary industry in the city’s GDP; degree of marketization (DM), assessed by the share of private and self-employed workers in total urban employment; and government self-sufficiency capacity (GSC), calculated as the ratio of local general public budget revenue to expenditure.</p>

              <p>This study employs a panel data regression model to examine the relationship between population density and urban resilience. Specifically, we adopt a fixed effects panel model to control for unobserved heterogeneity across cities. The basic form of the model is expressed as following Eq. (1):</p>

            <title>4.4. Study area and data source</title>
          
          <p>According to the Tabulation on 2020 China Population Census by County [38] and the China Urban-Rural Construction Statistical Yearbook 2022 [39], Chinese cities are classified into mega, very large, and large cities based on the number of permanent residents in built-up areas. This study focuses on large cities with a population of more than one million people in built-up areas. After excluding cities with significant data gaps, a final sample of 114 cities was selected for analysis.</p><p>The indicator data are primarily sourced from the China Statistical Yearbook (2006–2021) [40], the China Statistical Yearbook on Environment [41], and various provincial and municipal yearbooks. For missing values, supplementary data were estimated using linear interpolation and trend extrapolation based on historical records.</p>

            <title>4.5. City clustering</title>
          
          <p>Based on the average population size levels and land use during the study period, this paper uses SPSS 24.0 for statistical analysis to classify the 114 cities into three major clusters. Cluster 1, consists of 34 national core cities, primarily composed of municipalities, provincial capitals, and economically dominant metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. These cities typically hold provincial or sub-provincial administrative status, possess administrative advantages, large-scale economies, and well-developed infrastructure systems, and serve as national hubs in innovation, finance, and internationalization. Cluster 2 includes 46 regional center cities and industrially specialized cities, represented by Wenzhou and Luoyang. These cities have moderate economic development levels, with GDP ranging between 300 and 800 billion yuan, and fulfill specialized functional roles within provincial urban systems. Cluster 3 comprises 34 developing cities, including Sanming and Zhaoqing, characterized by smaller economies with GDP typically between 200 and 300 billion yuan, mainly serving localized development needs.</p>
