      <abstract><p>With the rapid development of solar power generation technology, the hotspot effect of photovoltaic (PV) arrays poses a key challenge to the efficiency and stability of the system. Conventional PV array models have significant limitations in dealing with complex shadow shading and multi-peak output characteristics, especially when confronted with complex topologies such as the complex-total-cross-tied (CTCT) structures. To address this issue, this paper proposed a mathematical model for PV arrays based on multipoint parabolic motion, which could accurately simulate the output characteristics of PV arrays under localized shading conditions. The model decomposed the current-voltage ($I-V$) characteristic curve of the PV arrays into multiple parabolic trajectories. A shadow shading model for complex structures was successfully constructed by combining with a kinematic model. MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experimental validation showed that the proposed model guaranteed computational accuracy with error less than 5%, while computational efficiency was greatly improved. The proposed model could accurately capture the multi-peak characteristics when compared with the traditional engineering model. Results from the experiment further verified the robustness of the model in dynamic shading scenarios, hence providing an efficient and reliable tool for maximum power tracking and hotspot localization in the PV system.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years, power generation with solar energy, an emerging green energy source, has achieved rapid development and become one of the most promising alternative energy sources in the 21st century. In practice, due to environmental and other factors, the light received by the photovoltaic arrays is not uniform, and even some parts of the array will be blocked so that the photovoltaic (PV) hotspot will be generated, thus affecting the output characteristics of the PV system. Therefore, the detection of PV modules through the process of its production, application, and repair has become a hotspot of current research and an important issue that cannot be ignored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. To realize the detection of PV modules, it is necessary to study the electrical output characteristics of PV monoliths as well as PV arrays, i.e., a suitable PV array model. The model is used to analyze and diagnose hotspot failures and provide timely remediation, based on the severity of shadow shading.</p><p>At present, domestic and international research on photovoltaic panel modeling is gradually expanding from basic theory to complex scenarios. Wang and Bian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] proposed an engineering mathematical model and a simulation model for the PV panels, which can accurately reproduce external output characteristics of the PV cells and their arrays under certain engineering environments, only according to the attribute parameters <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> provided on the relevant PV panels. Yet, it does not take into account the effect of shading. Shao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]systematically analyzed the performance of various PV array configurations under dynamic shading, and pointed out that the traditional series-parallel structure (SP) could be used for energy generation under dynamic shading. While electrical array reconfiguration (EAR) could optimize the performance, it still relied on hardware topology adjustment and could not respond to instantaneous shading changes in real time. In contrast, the model in this paper could directly achieve real-time parameter adjustment under dynamic shading through mathematical modeling without hardware reconfiguration, which significantly improved the computational efficiency. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] proposed a low-complexity maximum power point tracking algorithm, which simplified the computational steps but still required iterative optimization, and its real-time performance was limited. The model in this paper used analytical expressions to directly calculate the output characteristics under dynamic shadowing; it was suitable for online monitoring and control as it avoided the complex optimization process. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] and others proposed a hotspot detection method based on distributed fiber Bragg grating sensors. Although it could achieve high-precision temperature monitoring, it relied on the physical sensor hardware only, and did not incorporate multi-physical field dynamic parameters, such as light intensity, temperature, and so on. In this paper, we innovatively coupled light intensity, temperature, and real-time shadow trajectory to achieve the synergistic optimization of multi-physical fields by dynamically adjusting the model parameters to solve the dependence on a single factor in traditional methods.</p><p>Regarding the limitations of shading occlusion modeling, Shao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] further pointed out that although the traditional physical array reconstruction (PAR) and electrical array reconstruction (EAR) techniques could optimize the performance under dynamic shading, both of them required hardware tuning or sensor support, which led to an increase in the cost of the system. El Iysaouy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] analyzed four types of typical partial shading patterns and proposed a fast-modeling method for photovoltaic arrays under shading conditions, but this study did not consider the relevant situations of photovoltaic arrays with complex structures under shading conditions. Pei and Hao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] proposed a localized shading model based on dynamic light intensity adjustment, which could adapt to real-time shading variations, but did not consider the adaptability of complex topologies (e.g., complex-total-cross-tied (CTCT)). Chanchangi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] analyzed the effect of ash accumulation on the output power of PV modules, and the model was only applicable to a single type of shading. They did not cover the dynamic shading or the interaction effect of complex topological structures. Almarri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] investigated the interference of multi-factor coupling such as humidity and sand/gravel on the output characteristics of photovoltaic modules, but did not improve the shading model related to ash accumulation. Parvin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] proposed an error prediction troubleshooting method that could capture the dynamic response of shading but relied on recurrent neural network (RNN) training, which had limited real-time and high computational resource requirements. Tai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] analyzed the effect of local shadows based on a single diode equivalent circuit, but the model was not adapted to complex structures, such as CTCT. The computational complexity was significantly increased due to the inclusion of exponential/logarithmic operations. Although the reconstruction strategy proposed by Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] optimized the output power through the 0–1 multiple backpack problem, it relied on the principle of irradiance equalization and did not consider the dynamic adjustment of voltage distribution. In the above introduction, it can be found that there are still some problems to be improved in the current research on PV modules. The model in this paper provided insights into the study of PV modules and focused on solving these problems. The model in this paper avoided exponential/logarithmic operations through the parabolic motion segmented analysis. The computational efficiency was greatly improved while supporting the accurate modeling of complex topologies such as CTCT, coupling with multi-physical field parameters (light, temperature, and shading trajectory) to achieve dynamic optimization. Unquantified multi-peak errors under shading conditions may fail at high occlusion rates. Existing hotspot detection techniques mostly rely on infrared thermal imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], which can locate faults but require complex hardware support and high cost. This paper proposed models to reduce the dependence on physical sensors through mathematical modeling.</p><p>Having synthesized the analysis from the above literature, the existing photovoltaic hotspot model has limitations such as a large arithmetic capacity and a small scope of application. In this paper, based on the engineering model of photovoltaic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] combined with the kinematic model of photovoltaic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], we simulated the formation of hotspots by analyzing the relationship between the output voltage and current of PV arrays, and the output voltage and power. We constructed the photovoltaic hotspot fault model based on the multipoint parabolic motion under the local shadow shading and compared it with the engineering model.</p>

However, this model only described the output characteristics of the PV array under normal lighting conditions, and the output volt-ampere characteristic curve of the PV array was stepped in the case of shadow shading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>In this paper, the curve was first decomposed into multiple parabolas to simulate the multipoint parabolic motion. The corresponding equations were sequentially derived on the basis of the PV monolithic kinematics model. Finally, each segment of the parabolas was superimposed to derive the model of the PV array under the localized shadow.</p><p>Each segment of the parabolic curve can be established in the same coordinate system with the trajectory of the mass parabolic motion, which divides three segments <inline-formula>

          <p>By analogy with the physical mechanism, we showed that the PV array current-voltage segmentation characteristics had similarity with the acceleration phase of the parabolic motion.</p><p>Current-Voltage Characteristics of Photovoltaic Arrays</p><p>The current of a photovoltaic cell is dominated by photogenerated carriers (photovoltaic current), but its output current is attenuated by internal losses:</p><p><p>Constant Current Zone (Low Voltage Section): The photogenerated current is not significantly canceled, and the output current remains constant, similar to the initial free-fall phase of a parabolic motion, when gravity is the only driving force and the speed increases linearly.</p><p>Transition Zone (Medium Voltage Section): As the voltage increases, the reverse saturation current of the PN junction and the loss of the series resistance become progressively more significant and the current decreases nonlinearly. This is analogous to a parabolic motion in which air resistance (proportional to the square of the velocity) begins to cancel out the force of gravity, resulting in a gradual decrease in acceleration.</p><p>Constant Voltage Zone (High Voltage Section): As the voltage approaches the open circuit voltage, the photogenerated current is almost completely canceled out by the reverse current and ohmic losses, the current tends to zero and the system stabilizes. Similarly, parabolic motion reaches terminal velocity at the balance between drag and gravity, and acceleration is zero.</p></p><p>Acceleration Phase of Parabolic Motion</p><p><p>Free-fall phase: Gravity dominates; acceleration is constant and velocity increases linearly, corresponding to the constant flow region of the PV.</p><p>Resistance intervention phase: Air resistance increases with velocity and acceleration decreases, corresponding to the nonlinear decay of the cur-rent in the PV transition region.</p><p>Terminal velocity phase: Resistance is balanced with gravity; acceleration is zero, and velocity is stabilized, corresponding to current zeroing and voltage saturation in the constant voltage region of the PV.</p></p><p>The theoretical basis for the kinematics of this process of small balls is:</p><p>Stage 1: (<inline-formula>

      <title>3. Simulation verification</title>
      <p>In order to verify the superiority and applicability of the model established in this paper, PV arrays with various topologies (series, parallel, SP, TCT, and CTCT) were constructed in MATLAB/Simulink, in which CTCT arrays (each row of PV modules is connected in parallel first, and then connected in series between rows, and then a group of modules are connected in parallel again, and then continue to be connected in series) were simulated. The specific number of series and parallel connections was determined according to the actual situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] simulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. </p>

      <p>The current equation model of PV arrays under localized shadowing conditions established by Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] is applicable to PV arrays with simple structures under shadowing conditions. The voltage-current and voltage-power curves of this model and the engineering model, and the multipoint parabolic model under series and SP structures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>. As for the voltage-current curves, the engineering model and the multipoint parabolic model are nearly coincidental, and the trend of current change is consistent, hence providing reliable results, while the current equation model is obviously deviated from the key voltage nodes and the amplitude of the current change varies greatly, resulting in larger simulation errors. As for the voltage-power curve, the engineering model and the multipoint parabolic model have similar location and value of the maximum power point, which can effectively guide the practical application, while the current equation model has low value and deviation of the maximum power point, which is obviously insufficient to describe the power output characteristics. Since the voltage in the current equation model depends on the maximum value of the voltage of each column of the PV array, this leads to an error in the value of the voltage in the shading part. In addition, since the current in this model is calculated by dividing each column into two segments, the corresponding PV array has at least two PV modules in series, which makes it impossible to accurately describe complex PV arrays such as parallel, TCT, and CTCT if they are encountered. Therefore, the multipoint parabolic model simulates with high accuracy and consistency, and the current equation model is so limited that it is difficult to provide accurate and reliable results.</p>

      <p>In order to further verify the advancement of the model in this paper, the reconstruction strategy proposed by Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] was introduced as a benchmark for comparison. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, this strategy optimizes the output power through the 0–1 multiple backpack problem relied on the principle of irradiance equalization. The magnitude of power fluctuation under dynamic shadowing was significantly higher than that of the model in this paper. In addition, the elapsed time of its computation was far more than that of the current model, which further confirms the advantage of the proposed method in real time.</p>

      <p>It can be clearly seen from the comparison that the voltage and current values where the maximum power point of the current equation model is located have a larger offset, compared with the engineering model which has an impact on the adjustment of the operating voltage corresponding to the maximum power real-time output of the photovoltaic power plant. The voltage and current parameters corresponding to the maximum power point of the multipoint parabolic model and the engineering model are almost the same. Since the engineering model involves exponential operations, the calculation is cumbersome and complex. The model proposed in this paper, on the premise that the error reaches 5% or less, significantly reduces the calculation amount compared with the engineering model, and the solution is simpler. It is therefore possible to quickly and accurately calculate the output characteristics of PV arrays in the face of arbitrary shading patterns such as different light intensities, different shading locations and areas, etc., thus providing robust support for real-time monitoring of PV systems, maximum power tracking and control, and other practical applications which greatly improves the operational efficiency and stability of PV systems. Shading is a temporary fault that requires dynamic modeling support, and the model in this paper is segmentally fitted by parabolic motion, and can successfully capture the multi-peak characteristics under dynamic shading. In addition, the multipoint parabolic model constructed in this paper has a wide range of applications, which is not only limited to series-parallel, SP, and TCT structures, but also applicable to other complex PV array structures.</p>

      <title>4. Hotspot simulation platform measurement and analysis</title>
      <p>In order to verify the accuracy of the proposed model, a hotspot simulation platform consisting eight PV panels, current input distribution isolator module, signal acquisition module, and control module was constructed. The block diagram of the hardware circuit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>.</p>
      <p>Each photovoltaic panel was connected to the relay through the control of the relay on and off to realize the transformation of the topology of the photovoltaic array. The platform used the MY1521 current input distribution isolator, whose function is to isolate the direct current (DC) signal output from the photovoltaic array, and then converted to a standard voltage signal. The output current and output voltage collected through the current input distribution isolator entered the control module (laptop) through the signal acquisition module, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>.</p>

</inline-formula> of the multipoint parabolic model is consistent with the measured data of the PV arrays with SP and TCT structures; it is improved by 3% compared with the measured data of the PV arrays with CTCT structure. This is due to the fact that the theoretical model is derived under the ideal conditions, thereby ignoring the loss of diodes inside the PV panels and the effect of temperature changes during the experiment. The trend of most of the measured points is consistent with the theoretical curve. Therefore, the multipoint parabolic model proposed in this paper can accurately describe the output characteristics of complex PV arrays under shadow shading.</p>
      <p>From the results of the comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref>, it can be seen that there are some numerical differences between the measured data and the theoretical output curves of the multi-parabolic model.

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper combined the PV monolithic engineering model and the kinematic model to establish a multipoint parabolic motion PV array model under localized shadowing conditions. Simulation and experimental verification were performed to analyze the output characteristics of the proposed model under localized shadowing conditions. When compared with the engineering model and other improved models, the currently proposed model can be applied to the modeling of complex topology PV arrays under local shadowing conditions. The curve of the output characteristics of the present model has an error of less than 5% in comparison with the engineering model, thus providing theoretical and experimental bases for the study of maximum power tracking of PV systems and reducing the loss of PV system output power. Although the model in this paper has been significantly optimized in terms of computational efficiency, there is still a large room for improvement. In the future, it can be combined with deep learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] to apply multimodal data to further improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis under dynamic shadowing. By integrating the bending characteristics of flexible PV arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] with the shadow shading model in this paper, the optimization of PV systems under multi-physics field coupling can be explored. Moreover, further integration of physical modeling and machine learning techniques is also possible. Using the multipoint parabolic model in this paper as a feature extraction tool, combined with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework proposed by Zwirtes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], a hybrid fault diagnosis system could be constructed. This could help retain the accurate description of multi-peak characteristics of the physical model, take advantage of machine learning to generalize dynamic shading and unknown faults, and enhance the efficiency of real-time monitoring of the PV system.</p>
