      <abstract><p>The lethal coronavirus illness (COVID-19) has evoked worldwide discussion. This contagious, sometimes fatal illness, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. So far, COVID-19 has quickly spread to other countries, sickening millions across the globe. To predict the future occurrences of the disease, it is important to develop mathematical models with the fewest errors. In this study, classification and regression tree (CART) models and autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMAs) are employed to model and forecast the one-month confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, using the data on daily confirmed cases. To validate the predictions, these models were compared through data tests. The test results show that the CART regression model outperformed the ARIMA model in terms of accuracy, leading to a fast growth in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The research findings help governments to make proper decisions on how the prepare for the outbreak. Besides, our analysis reveals the lack of quarantine wards in Nigeria, in addition to the insufficiency of medications, medical staff, lockdown decisions, volunteer training, and economic preparation.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The extreme acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (COVID-19) has prompted a global alert. The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads through saliva droplets or nasal discharge when an infected individual coughs or sneezes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The top five affected countries were the US, Brazil, India, Russia, and Spain. Sahai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] examined the time series data on the overall number of infected patients from these five nations. A 77-day out-of-sample forecast was produced using ARIMA models. By July 31st, India and Brazil would have 1.38 million and 2.47 million, respectively, while the US would have 4.29 million, according to their analysis. In the same vein, Anne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] used a time series model to predict the short-term transmission of the exponentially growing COVID-19 time series, with the aid of simulation. Taiwo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] used the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to model and forecast Nigerian confirmed and death cases as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This model predicts the number of cumulative instances over time and is validated using Akaike information criterion (AIC) statistics. ARIMA (1,2,0) and ARIMA (1,1,0) were selected to model the confirmed and death cases of COVID-19, respectively. Based on the results of the ARIMA model-building, the two models were demonstrated to be suitable for modeling and forecasting Nigerian COVID-19 data. The predicted values showed that, over the following three months, the number of cumulatively confirmed deaths and cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria may range from 189,019 to 327,426 and from 406 to 3,043, respectively (May 30, 2021). The ARIMA models predicted an alarming daily increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 death cases in Nigeria.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Ribeiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] forecasted the time series one, three, and six days ahead of the COVID-19 cumulative cases in ten Brazilian states using the following tools: Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning. In general, these models could provide credible predictions with errors ranging from 0.87% percent to 3.51%. Ceylan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] also developed auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to project COVID-19 occurrences in Italy, Spain, and France. The relevant data were collected from the official website of the World Health Organization, from February 21st through April 15th, 2020. Several ARIMA models with different parameters were created. With the lowest mean average percentage errors (MAPEs) (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335), ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models were the best prediction tools for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. ARIMA models are suitable for forecasting COVID-19 prevalence in Italy, Spain, and France. Their findings shed light on the disease patterns, and help assess the epidemiological stage of these locations.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">By employing Kuwait as a case study, Alabdulrazzaq et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] assessed and tested the accuracy of an ARIMA model over a reasonable timespan. The best-fit model was employed in Kuwait's progressive prevention plan to forecast confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases. At a 95% level of significance, the findings were compared to the actual values reported after the forecast period had passed. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the prediction points and the actual recorded data was determined to be 0.996. This suggests an unbreakable connection between the two sets. Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] integrated data envelopment analysis (DEA) with four different machine learning (ML) approaches to examine the effectiveness and performance of the COVID-19 response in the US. The performance of the COVID-19 response was predicted using environmental<span style="color: black;"> variables such as social distance, health policy, and socioeconomic indices. The performance was assessed using Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Boosted Tree (BT), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR). The 23 states had an average efficiency score of 0.97, indicating that they are efficient. Furthermore, the BT and RF models produced the best prediction results, while CART outperformed LR. The most significant factors influencing efficiency, in order, were urbanity, physical inactivity, the total number of tests per person, population density, and hospital beds.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">To forecast the COVID-19 outbreak, Ardabili et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] compared machine learning and soft computing approaches. Out of the many machine languages tested, only two models achieved the promising results. This paper acts as a preliminary benchmark to demonstrate machine learning's research potential. Pinter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] illustrated the usefulness of the hybrid machine learning approach in predicting COVID-19 in Hungary. The researchers proposed to project the time series of infected people and death rate, through a hybrid machine learning strategy using the multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The forecasts predict that the pandemic and overall morale will have greatly declined by late May. The validation process lasts for 9 days and produces good outcomes, demonstrating the model's accuracy. The model is predicted to maintain its accuracy as long as there is no significant disturbance. This paper provides an early benchmark to highlight the promise of machine learning research.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">For a number of nations, Chakraborty and Ghosh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] created short-term (real-time) predictions of upcoming COVID-19 cases as well as risk evaluations (in terms of case fatality rates) for a few particularly badly affected nations. The approach is based on a Wavelet-based forecasting model and an autoregressive integrated moving average model. In the first task, the researchers adopted the optimal regression tree to identify crucial factors that significantly affect case fatality rates across nations. The analysis of early risk estimates for 50 severely affected countries undoubtedly yielded in-depth insights from this data-driven investigation.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Univariate time series models, machine learning, and epidemiologic compartment models have all been used in numerous studies to forecast COVID-19 transmission rates and analyze their effects on public health, urban mobility, and the environment. The goal of this work is to model and forecast one-month confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria utilizing daily confirmed cases. The CART models and ARIMAs were employed to assure the prediction accuracy and utilize their intrinsic power to explore big data.</p>

            <title>3.2. Arima modelling</title>
          
          <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Having made the series stationary, the decision was made on reasonable values of the orders of the Autoregressive (AR(ϕ)), ordinary differencing, Moving Average (MA(θ)).</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">After trying different ARIMA models of various orders, to choose the best model, we look for the model with the least AIC. Brockwell and Davis (1991) in their research suggest that AIC is the primary criterion in selecting the orders of a time series.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">After various trials, it was discovered that the ARIMA model (3,1,0) for covid cases gives the minimum MSE. This is observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">After various trials, it was discovered that the ARIMA model (1,1,0) for covid deaths gives the minimum MSE. This is observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The ultimate aim of building any time series model is forecasting. If this objective is not achieved, the work is incomplete. Forecasts were made for the possible number of covid cases and deaths. Based on the chosen model, the forecast for 12 months is seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p style="text-indent: 10.1pt;">The COVID-19 cases and deaths exhibited non-stationarity. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) proposed by Box-Jenkins was employed to analyse COVID-19 cases and deaths from March 2020. The study is mainly to model and forecast the monthly covid cases and deaths for twelve months. Moreover, several models were developed but based on minimum corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) value, estimation of necessary parameters and series of diagnostic tests were performed. It was observed that ARIMA (3,1,0) model was the best model for modelling covid cases, while ARIMA (1,1,0) model was the best model for modelling covid deaths.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.1pt;">The CART model gave a 99.97% accuracy score for the training set and a 99.93% accuracy score the test set. Each round square box represents a node, with a number at the top indicating the node's ID. The value on the box's first line represents the mean of all observations in that node (if it is a leaf node, the mean is utilized for prediction). Unpruned trees produce better forecasts than trimmed ones. The tree model predicts the same thing for all observations that occur under the same leaf node, which approximates the underlying pattern to a large extent. A larger sample size would be necessary to obtain a more precise estimate. By tracking the overall drop in the optimization criterion, an aggregate measure may be developed to emphasize the significance of each feature in the model.</p>
