      <abstract><p>Course evaluation, a critical component for the implementation of outcome-based education (OBE), provides substantial data support. The reliability, validity, and discriminative power of evaluation results are significantly influenced by the choice of course evaluation methods. An effective course evaluation method identifies weak links in the teaching process, offering a foundation and reference for continuous course improvement. This study introduces a course evaluation method based on achievement pathways, establishing the supportive relationship among course-related graduation requirement indicators, course objectives, and achievement pathways. Grounded on formative assessment, a system to quantify the achievement of teaching objectives in courses is constructed. The method has been applied to courses, such as Data Visualization and Software Engineering, at the Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology. Practice demonstrates that this method is capable of identifying weaknesses in the course implementation process, providing theoretical foundation and reliable assurance for ongoing course improvement.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the OBE model, the learning outcomes of students are considered the most powerful and direct evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of talent cultivation. Educators are required to have a clear understanding of the capabilities and levels students should achieve upon graduation, and then seek to design appropriate educational methods and teaching means to ensure these anticipated goals are met. As the fundamental carrier of student learning, courses play a crucial role in supporting the achievement of graduation requirements and realizing training objectives. The student-centered philosophy of OBE emphasizes that teaching objectives precede teaching content, advocating for reverse instructional design based on the evaluation of course objective achievement to guide continuous improvement in teaching activities. In this process, course evaluation serves as an essential support for continuous course improvement and ensuring the quality of professional talent cultivation, holding significant importance.</p><p>Research on course evaluation typically employs either summative or formative evaluation methods to assess course objectives. Summative evaluation, often presented in the form of exams, tests, or reports, predominantly assesses knowledge content and is more readily quantified through objective scores. In contrast, formative evaluation assesses not only knowledge but also the soft skills students exhibit in their daily learning processes, such as performance, attitude, abilities, and literacy. Summative evaluation is conducted after the course completion for continuous improvement at the course level, while formative evaluation allows for timely feedback adjustments, fostering maximized teacher and student growth. This study combines summative and formative evaluations, proposing a quantifiable course objective evaluation system based on the achievement pathways of courses. This system effectively addresses the measurability issue in quantifying formative evaluations, enabling teachers and students to monitor the achievement status of teaching objectives in real-time throughout the teaching process. As a result, it facilitates instructional feedback and strategy adjustments for continuous course improvement.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>In OBE, course evaluation is identified as an activity that assesses the implementation process and outcomes of a course based on its objectives, serving instructional decision-making. It is a process where the real or potential effects of teaching activities are judged. Comprehensive and holistic evaluations of the entire course implementation process are conducted, positioning course evaluation as the logical endpoint of the teaching process, yet also as the starting point for new teaching processes. Teaching, being a complex process activity, does not guarantee immediate improvements through course evaluation, but it allows for a deeper understanding of the relationship between student emotional needs and their agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Bacchus et al., 2020</xref>). Course evaluation clarifies the direction of course teaching design, guides teaching activities towards more effective approaches, and indicates the direction of effort for both teachers and students, thus holding significance in guiding teaching practices.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Yang et al. (2021)</xref> conducted a multivariate linear regression on evaluative indicators for student learning development, theoretically constructing an evaluative indicator system for student learning engagement and improving the evaluation indicator system using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Ma et al. (2022)</xref>. utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on course assessment scores, assigning weight vectors to different course objectives for corresponding chapters, calculating the achievement levels of different chapters, and thereby obtaining the overall course achievement level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Xu et al. (2020)</xref>, on the basis of analyzing the support relationship between course teaching content and student capability achievement, employed course assessment score analysis and rubric analysis methods to calculate achievement levels, forming a forward implementation, reverse evaluation teaching evaluation method. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Yuan (2019)</xref> applied the Delphi method, using controlled feedback group communication as an expert opinion collection method to avoid the weaknesses of subjective weighting, establishing the relationship between graduation requirement indicators and supporting courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Wang et al. (2024)</xref> proposed a "dual-thinking union" multi-granularity graduation requirement evaluation method addressing the granularity issue of evaluation for graduation requirements in broad-category enrollment majors. This method evaluates from a micro-level according to course groups, from a macro-level according to individual students, objectively using survey questionnaires for evaluation, and subjectively using achievement level calculations for evaluation.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Yan et al. (2023)</xref> emphasized the dual role of students as both subjects of classroom teaching and evaluation, advocating for an evaluation of both teaching and learning quality. On this basis, a student evaluation of teaching indicator system was constructed to promote the digital transformation of classroom teaching quality through student evaluations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Li &amp;amp; Hou (2023)</xref> developed an improvement algorithm for course objectives and graduation requirements achievement levels based on the conversion of "qualitative judgment weights to quantitative composite weights" and "evaluation object decomposition into corresponding support relationships", achieving the calculation of course objective achievement levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Zhang (2021)</xref> utilized factor analysis to analyze the achievement of student graduation requirements, extracting eight indicators of graduation requirement achievement. The factor score coefficient matrix was improved based on the explanatory significance of the extracted indicators, and the entropy weight method was applied to determine the weights of each indicator and calculate the graduation requirement achievement levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Wang et al. (2023)</xref> constructed a basic process and evaluation method system for course objective achievement evaluation. Using the course of deformation monitoring and data processing as an example, the relationship among graduation requirements, course objectives, and course content was established to analyze the course objective achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Li (2023)</xref> established a model for the quantitative evaluation of the achievement levels of course teaching objectives through establishing the match between evaluation content and core competency indicators, encompassing the entire course teaching process, and setting a unified quantitative evaluation standard, implemented in the teaching of engineering drawing courses.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Li (2021)</xref> began with the analysis of the indicator-course corresponding matrix, applying a graded and hierarchical method to determine the support degree of courses for indicators. Based on teachers’ qualitative evaluations of indicators and students’ self-evaluations, combined with the operation rules of qualitative data, a qualitative evaluation of the achievement of course indicators was conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Biaer (2019)</xref> employed an open-ended survey questionnaire to understand the learning experiences of students and peers within learning communities, capturing content not accessible through quantitative analysis, used to assess learning outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Kilgour et al. (2020)</xref> proposed a joint co-construction method, allowing students and teachers to collaboratively design course evaluation criteria. Data collection was achieved through an improved Delphi method, questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews, facilitating the assessment of learning outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Hanefar et al. (2022)</xref> noted the transition from summative to formative evaluation in course evaluation, collecting data through surveys and semi-structured interviews to investigate the impact of formative evaluation on teaching practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ana et al. (2020)</xref> used electronic standards to assess students’ skills and abilities, enabling learners to present their learning situations in a real and interpretable manner, while also allowing students to monitor their progress and weaknesses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Yulianto (2022)</xref> applied a qualitative descriptive method in the Merdeka Belajar course, integrating diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment modes, considering assessment as an inseparable part of learning, not only to determine the achievement of learning outcomes but more importantly to enhance students’ abilities during the learning process.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Tractenberg (2021)</xref> discussed an Assessment and Evaluation Reporting (AER) method based on semi-qualitative analysis, through which teachers could evaluate the outcomes of educational assessments to ensure these outcomes foster learning or embody the student-centered educational philosophy. This serves as a means to improve instructional design and optimize teaching measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Sasipraba et al. (2020)</xref>, drawing on the characteristics of projects at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, categorized students into groups, defining distinct COs-POs mapping sets for each group. The performance of students in capstone projects was discussed, and a capstone project evaluation framework was established to assess learning outcomes.</p><p>Existing research has investigated course evaluation methods from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, with some developing course evaluation systems and others assessing the evaluation framework. While graduation requirement indicators are supported by the professional course system, they are not synonymous with teaching objectives, as different teaching objectives and design philosophies may vary. A mere superficial structural connection between graduation requirement indicators and teaching objectives is insufficient; an intrinsic substantive link is also required to facilitate the transformation of talent cultivation models and teaching methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Meng et al., 2021</xref>). This study begins by discussing the relationship between course-related graduation requirement indicators, course objectives, and achievement pathways. A quantitative course evaluation method based on achievement pathways is proposed, combined with a survey questionnaire to test the method’s effectiveness and reasonableness. The practical application of this method in courses is also elaborated.</p>

      <title>3. The course evaluation method based on achievement pathways</title>
      <p>The course evaluation method based on achievement pathways is constructed under the constraint of the course’s support for graduation requirement indicators, based on course objectives and achievement pathways, following a scientific method to create a specific variable system for evaluating the achievement of course objectives. Starting from student sample data, this method assesses and scores students’ performance throughout the course learning process, using process assessment materials to quantitatively calculate the achievement of each course objective and graduation requirement indicator.</p><p>Graduation requirement indicators supported by the course from various dimensions delineate the knowledge, skills, and competencies required to master the course. The teaching objectives of the course provide close support for the graduation requirement indicators. Under the constraint of these indicators, and combined with the content characteristics of the course, the teaching objectives to be achieved by the course are formulated. Thus, an evaluative relationship between course objectives and graduation requirement indicators is established.</p><p>The establishment of course objectives offers crucial support for the design of course content, the implementation of teaching processes, and the evaluation of the course. The implementation of the teaching process relies on a series of specific and effective teaching segments, namely the pathways to achieve course objectives. Each course objective may be supported by multiple achievement pathways, each representing one or some course objectives from different perspectives. All achievement pathways of a course collectively represent all course objectives, thereby establishing an evaluative relationship between achievement pathways and course objectives.</p><p>The course evaluation method based on achievement pathways encompasses the construction of course objectives, the establishment of evaluation weights, and the calculation of achievement levels. The construction of course objectives is grounded on the course’s support for graduation requirement indicators, determining the teaching objectives the course aims to achieve. A series of reasonable and effective achievement pathways are designed to achieve these teaching objectives, clarifying each pathway’s support for the course objectives, thereby establishing an evaluative relationship among achievement pathways, course objectives, and graduation requirement indicators. Based on this evaluative relationship, the achievement of course objectives by student sample data within the achievement pathways is assessed, further evaluating the achievement of course objectives in relation to graduation requirement indicators, thus obtaining the evaluation results of the course based on achievement pathways.</p>

            <title>3.1. Construction of course objectives</title>
          
          <p>The Bloom’s Taxonomy of Educational Objectives divides educational objectives into the dimensions of knowledge and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Anderson, 2018</xref>). The formulation of course objectives necessitates a comprehensive consideration of the retention and transfer of student learning. On the basis of providing essential knowledge and cognitive processes, emphasis is placed on the cultivation and training of students’ constructivist learning abilities. The development of student capabilities is systematic; graduation requirements and capabilities do not exist in isolation but are interconnected within a systematic whole according to certain logical relationships. Therefore, graduation requirement indicators and course objectives are intricately linked, supporting each other mutually.</p><p>Assuming the number of graduation requirement indicators supported by the course is denoted as $m<inline-formula>

          <p>Achievement pathways facilitate the realization of course objectives, which in turn support the achievement of graduation requirement indicators. Within this two-tier support relationship, the contribution of each achievement pathway to different course objectives and the contribution of each course objective to different graduation requirement indicators vary. If evaluation weights are used to express this contribution, then the evaluation weights of different achievement pathways towards course objectives and the evaluation weights of different course objectives towards graduation requirement indicators can differ.</p><p>The evaluation weights of course graduation requirement indicators. Each course contributes differently to the professional graduation requirements; hence, the support of different courses to the professional graduation requirements can have varying weights, meaning the evaluation weights of different course graduation indicators themselves can be different. Following a method similar to that described in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Gregori-Giralt &amp;amp; Menéndez-Varela (2021)</xref>, and adhering to Messick’s unified construct validity theory, an expert panel is assembled. The evaluation weights of the course graduation requirement indicators are quantified by several domain experts based on the professional educational philosophy, training objectives, course system, and the contribution level of courses to graduation requirements, followed by mean calculation to determine quantitative evaluation weights.</p><p><p>The evaluation weights of course objectives towards graduation requirement indicators. The evaluation weights of course objectives towards graduation requirement indicators are quantified by a course expert group based on the course graduation requirement indicators and the status and role of the course, followed by mean calculation, and finally confirmed for reasonableness by the profession.</p><p>The evaluation weights of achievement pathways towards course objectives. The evaluation weights of the course achievement pathways themselves, as well as the evaluation weights of achievement pathways towards course objectives, are quantified by the course instructors based on the course objectives and achievement pathways, followed by mean calculation, and finally confirmed for reasonableness by the course expert group.</p></p><p>Assuming there are $p<inline-formula>

            <title>3.3. Calculation of achievement levels</title>
          
          <p>The determination of evaluation weights signifies the establishment of proportions for all assessment content during the course implementation process. Based on the scores obtained by student samples on various achievement pathways during the teaching implementation process, and considering the support relationship of achievement pathways towards course objectives, the achievement levels of each course objective within the achievement pathways can be calculated. Furthermore, based on the support relationship between course objectives and related graduation requirement indicators, the achievement level of each related graduation requirement indicator within each achievement pathway can be calculated. On this basis, by summarizing all achievement pathways, the achievement levels of each related graduation requirement indicator supported by course objectives can be determined. Finally, the final achievement level of the course can be calculated based on the weights of the related graduation requirement indicators and the achievement level of each graduation requirement indicator, as shown in Algorithm 1.</p><p>Algorithm 1: Algorithm for calculating achievement levels</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p style="text-align: justify">Input: Set $A<inline-formula>

            <title>3.4. Students’ evaluation of the course evaluation method based on achievement pathways</title>
          
          <p>Students, being the primary agents of classroom and course learning, play a crucial role in the student-centered OBE educational philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of conducting teaching from the perspectives and stances of students. Student participation in assessing their learning positively impacts addressing student needs and implementing improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Montenegro &amp;amp; Jankowski, 2020</xref>). To evaluate the effectiveness and rationality of the course evaluation method based on achievement pathways, this study employed a survey questionnaire approach. By designing and distributing questionnaires to students who selected the course, opinions on the rationality of the setting of course objectives and evaluation weights were obtained, along with self-evaluations of the achievement of course objectives by the students. Through self-assessment, student sample data were collected and processed by mean calculation to obtain a qualitative understanding of the students’ mastery of course objectives across different achievement pathways, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> shows the survey statistics on the achievement of course objectives. The survey results indicated that approximately 90% of students deemed the setting of course objectives and evaluation weights as reasonable; 80%-90% of students found the results of the achievement level calculation based on achievement pathways to be at least equal to their expectations, suggesting that the course evaluation method based on achievement pathways is both reasonable and effective.</p>

          <p>By comparing each student sample’s score for each course objective on each achievement pathway with the full score of the course objective on that pathway, the achievement situation of each student sample for each course objective within each achievement pathway can be calculated, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>. For example, if student sample 310811’s regular grade score for Course Objective 2 is 1.8 out of a full score of 2, then the achievement of this student’s regular grade for Course Objective 2 is calculated as 1.8/2 = 0.9. Using the same method, the achievement of this student’s regular grades towards each course objective can be calculated.</p>

          <p>From the achievement level calculation results, it is observed that among all the achievement pathways, the overall achievement level of course objectives in the final exam segment is comparatively low, followed by the achievement level in the experiment assessment segment; Course Objectives 4 and 5 have the lowest achievement levels, suggesting that these areas could be targeted for improvement in subsequent efforts.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study proposes a quantitative calculation method for course achievement under the OBE model, based on achievement pathways. It constructs a quantitative constraint relationship among course-related graduation requirement indicators, course objectives, and achievement pathways, along with an evaluation algorithm for course achievement based on achievement pathways. This method has been practically applied in several courses within the big data and computer science majors of Beijing Institute of Petrochemical Technology, including Data Visualization, Software Engineering, C# Programming and Applications, Engineering Project Practice, showing positive outcomes. By calculating the achievement levels of various course objectives within different achievement pathways and the achievement levels of graduation requirement indicators, weaknesses in the course implementation process can be identified, providing a theoretical basis and reliable assurance for the continuous improvement of courses.</p>
