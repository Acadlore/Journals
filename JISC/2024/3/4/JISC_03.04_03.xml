      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the notion of smart homes has gained substantial support as a solution to the issues provided by urbanization, increased energy needs, and the environmental effect of excessive energy usage. The IoT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] has evolved as a game-changing technology, allowing objects and systems to communicate with one another to create new solutions across several disciplines. One major use of IoT is home automation and energy management, where smart technology may help to optimize energy consumption while also improving consumer ease. This study takes a step toward in fulfilling this ambition by combining IoT to produce intelligent, cost-effective solutions for monitoring and regulating power use.</p><p>The fast development of urban populations, along with an increased reliance on electricity, has resulted in rising energy demands, taxing current power production facilities and driving up electricity bills. Furthermore, inefficient energy usage and waste in the residential and commercial sectors contribute to the depletion of natural resources and environmental damage. The rising urbanization and increased energy consumption have resulted in substantial issues in energy management. For instance, global electricity consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] has been expanding at an average rate of 3% yearly since 2010, with residential energy use accounting for around 29% of total electricity consumption worldwide. Poor energy usage in households adds to roughly 20% of energy wastage, as indicated by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This wasting not only increases electricity prices but also exacerbates environmental challenges, such as greenhouse gas emissions. These difficulties underline the urgent need for creative solutions like IoT-based smart home automation systems, which can minimize energy use and promote sustainable practices.</p><p>These difficulties highlight the need for novel approaches to promoting energy saving and sustainable development. Smart energy management systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] based on IoT have emerged as a viable option. Such systems provide real-time monitoring, automation, and optimization of energy usage, allowing customers to make educated decisions regarding their electricity consumption. They also help to integrate renewable energy sources, resulting in a cleaner and more sustainable energy ecology. The impetus for this project derives from the urgent need to solve these difficulties while also offering end consumers with inexpensive and user-friendly solutions for successfully managing their energy use.</p><p>The proliferation of IoT devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], as well as developments in communication technology, have enabled the design and implementation of systems that were previously deemed technically and economically infeasible. Using these technical breakthroughs, the suggested solution aims to close the gap between energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, making smart energy management more accessible to a larger audience. The initiative focuses on solving the concerns of homes and small business owners, who frequently face high power bills and little access into their energy usage habits.</p><p>Despite the developments in IoT-based home automation systems, some gaps remain unresolved. Many present systems focus exclusively on basic automation tasks without integrating complete energy management features. For instance, while some systems have remote control capabilities, they generally lack real-time energy consumption tracking and cost analysis, which are critical for informed decision-making. Additionally, many solutions are not developed with scalability in mind, restricting their usability in different residential and small company situations. This study intends to overcome these gaps by designing a cost-effective, user-friendly IoT-based system that integrates real-time monitoring, remote control, and energy optimization capabilities.</p><p>The major goal of this study is to create an IoT-based home automation and energy monitoring system that takes a complete, user-centric approach to regulating power use. The system is intended to accomplish the following particular goals:</p><p>â¢ Real-time monitoring: This allows customers to track their energy use and gain extensive insights into the usage patterns of particular appliances.</p><p>â¢ Cost calculation: This provides realistic estimates of power prices, allowing customers to comprehend the financial consequences of their energy use and find cost-saving alternatives.</p><p>â¢ Remote operation: This allows consumers to remotely operate their electrical appliances via a mobile app, increasing ease and aiding proactive energy management.</p><p>â¢ Energy optimization: This enables consumers to optimize their energy use by scheduling appliance use and obtaining advice for energy-saving measures.</p><p>â¢ Scalability and affordability: This makes sure that the system is scalable to suit a variety of use cases while being cost-effective for mass adoption by individuals and small companies.</p><p>The scope of the research goes beyond the technical installation of the system to include an assessment of its efficacy in terms of energy savings and user satisfaction. The studyâs goal is to illustrate the potential of smart technologies in revolutionizing how energy is consumed and managed at the grassroots level by combining IoT and home automation.</p><p>Smart energy management is critical for tackling global energy concerns. With the worldâs population anticipated to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, demand for energy is likely to skyrocket, demanding novel solutions to balance supply and demand while minimizing environmental effect. Traditional energy management approaches, which rely on human monitoring and control, are unsuitable to address these difficulties because of their limited scalability and efficiency.</p><p>The integration of IoT into energy management systems has various benefits that make it a game changer in this industry.</p><p>â¢ Enhanced energy efficiency: Smart energy management systems provide granular control and monitoring of energy consumption, assisting users in identifying and eliminating inefficiencies.</p><p>â¢ Cost savings: By offering insights into energy use trends and enabling automatic appliance control, these solutions help consumers drastically cut their power expenditures.</p><p>â¢ Environmental benefits: Efficient energy consumption minimizes the need for fossil fuel-based power generation, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint.</p><p>â¢ User empowerment: By providing real-time data and actionable insights, smart energy management systems enable users to regulate their energy use and make educated decisions.</p><p>â¢ Support for renewable energy: Smart systems may effortlessly interact with renewable energy sources like solar panels, allowing consumers to increase their reliance on sustainable energy.</p><p>The proposed method corresponds with these advantages, offering a practical and meaningful answer to the issues of energy management. By focusing on households and small business owners, the system serves a vital section of energy users who are generally hesitant to embrace modern energy management technology owing to cost or complexity. This study seeks to provide a holistic system that integrates IoT capabilities, real-time data processing, and automation to provide a consistent user experience.</p><p>The remaining sections of this work are structured below. Section 2 examines present research and technology on IoT-based home automation and energy management systems, identifying important gaps and potential. Section 3 describes in full the design and implementation process, including the selection of hardware and software components.

          <p>At the heart of the hardware configuration are Arduino microcontrollers, which act as central processing units. Arduino boards were selected because they are versatile, inexpensive, and simple to program. These microcontrollers are in charge of processing sensor data and carrying out control orders received through the mobile application. The modular architecture of Arduino boards enables smooth connection with other hardware components, making them perfect for IoT applications. The Arduino microcontrollers communicate with current and voltage sensors to properly assess power usage. The data acquired by these sensors was analyzed in real time and sent to the associated mobile app via Bluetooth connection. The microcontrollerâs processing efficiency guarantees low latency, allowing for quick replies to user inputs.</p><p>Relays are important in the hardware configuration because they act as an interface between the Arduino and the electrical appliances it is linked to. These electromechanical switches regulate the flow of energy to devices, allowing them to be turned on and off remotely in response to human inputs or predetermined schedules. The usage of relays guarantees that the system can manage a variety of electrical loads while being safe and reliable. Each relay was carefully chosen based on its power rating to guarantee compatibility with the appliances it powers. The system is intended to support both low-power devices, such as lighting fixtures, and high-power appliances, such as air conditioners and refrigerators.

This issue was fixed by fine-tuning the baud rate settings and ensuring appropriate startup of the Bluetooth module in the Arduino code. Additionally, rigorous debugging and testing of the relay module connections were necessary to assure proper switching of appliances without electrical interference. These small issues were overcome through repeated testing and optimization, resulting in a robust and responsive system.</p><p>The combination of Arduino microcontrollers, relays, and electrical appliances creates a unified system capable of real-time monitoring and control. The hardwareâs modular architecture facilitates scalability, allowing the system to incorporate more devices or sophisticated functions such as load balancing or integration with renewable energy sources. Future hardware upgrades might include the replacement of Bluetooth modules with Wi-Fi or Zigbee communication modules, which provide longer range and better connection.

          <p>The software implementation of the IoT-based energy monitoring and control system is intended to provide seamless connectivity, efficient energy monitoring, and real-time control of electrical appliances. The software was created with the Arduino IDE, utilizing libraries and programming approaches to provide reliable operation and user-friendly interaction via a mobile application.</p><p>The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used to program the Arduino microcontrollers, providing a simple platform for creating, compiling, and uploading code. The IDE supports a variety of libraries, including the SoftwareSerial library, which is essential for establishing Bluetooth connectivity between the Arduino board and the mobile application. The SoftwareSerial library was used to enable serial communication via non-default pins, allowing the Bluetooth module to work with other peripherals attached to the microcontroller. This library enables the seamless transmission of data, ensuring that real-time monitoring and control actions occur without delay.</p><p>Calculating power usage for each connected appliance is an important part of the software solution. This is accomplished by assigning a variable that maintains each applianceâs power rating. When an appliance is turned on using the mobile application, the software sets up a counter to measure how long the equipment is operational. The counter records time in predetermined units, such as hours, allowing for exact tracking of usage. The power usage is then computed using the formula in Eq.

      <title>5. Discussion and limitations</title>
      <p>The proposed IoT-based smart home automation system helps to energy savings and environmental sustainability by optimizing energy use and decreasing waste. It provides real-time monitoring and management of appliances, allowing users detect inefficiencies and achieve energy savings, with experiments suggesting possible reductions in home energy usage. This decrease not only cuts energy demand but also helps alleviate pressure on power grids by arranging appliance usage during off-peak hours. Environmentally, the system can drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions, averting carbon monoxide emissions yearly. Widespread adoption of such systems might help to global efforts to mitigate climate change by lowering reliance on fossil fuels and supporting sustainable energy practices.</p><p>While the system works well in its current state, various opportunities for future development and innovation were recognized. Future research in IoT-based home automation and energy management might examine various areas for development and innovation to expand the systemâs capabilities. One interesting path is switching from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi communication, which would considerably increase the working range of the system, enabling remote control of appliances via the internet. This would allow for real-time updates on energy use and cost statistics, enabling users make more educated decisions. A preliminary feasibility study might be done within three months, followed by an approximate 6-month development and testing phase. Additionally, incorporating voice assistant technologies might allow consumers hands-free control, boosting convenience and user experience. This integration might be created over four months, including essential testing and interface design.</p><p>The suggested IoT-based home automation system, while successful in energy management and monitoring, is not without possible issues and limits. One of the key issues is the security and privacy of user data, as IoT-based systems are inherently exposed to cyberattacks and unwanted access. The usage of Bluetooth communication, while cost-effective, has limited range and is prone to interception if not adequately protected. To address these issues, future versions of the system might integrate improved encryption methods for data transfer and user authentication techniques, such as two-factor authentication or biometric verification, to boost security. Additionally, migrating to Wi-Fi connectivity would require powerful firewalls and intrusion detection systems to defend against external attacks. Privacy issues might be minimized by ensuring that all user data is handled locally on the device rather than being saved on external servers, hence lowering the possibility of data breaches. These steps, together with frequent software upgrades and security patches, can considerably increase the systemâs resistance to possible attacks and assure customer trust in IoT-based home automation systems.</p><p>Another area for future study is the use of advanced data analytics to deliver individualized energy-saving suggestions based on user usage habits. This would include a 5-month research and development phase to evaluate data and provide actionable insights using advanced algorithms. Furthermore, scalability and modular design should be addressed to suit bigger families or small enterprises, ensuring that the system can handle a greater range of devices and activities. A 6-month study might examine the systemâs performance under varying loads, solving these scalability difficulties. These recommended additions, while beyond the focus of this study, provide key prospects for enhancing IoT-based energy management systems, promoting sustainable energy habits, and improving overall user experiences.</p>
