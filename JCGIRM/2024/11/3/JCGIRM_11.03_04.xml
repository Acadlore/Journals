      <abstract><p>This study investigates risk distribution models in the context of auto insurance in emerging markets, with a focus on the National Insurance Company (SAA), regional directorate of Setif, Algeria. The research applies generalized linear models (GLM) and factor analysis to model the frequency of vehicle accidents and their associated risks. A comprehensive approach is employed, beginning with a discussion of the techniques used for data collection and preliminary descriptive analysis. Following this, a theoretical framework is established for understanding the risk distribution models, highlighting the role of GLM in the modelling of accident frequencies within the insurance industry. Different types of factor analysis, including basic coefficient analysis, cross-factor analysis, generalized cross-factor analysis, and mixed factor analysis, are examined in relation to their applicability to insurance risk modelling. Subsequently, generalized linear models are implemented to derive a robust model for accident frequency, utilizing R software for analysis. The results reveal that the pricing system of the National Insurance Company is influenced by multiple, non-deterministic factors, which complicate the prediction of accident rates and insurance costs. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating various risk factors into pricing strategies, rather than relying on deterministic models. The study highlights the necessity of considering a broader range of factors in the development of pricing systems, particularly in emerging markets where data may be incomplete or subject to considerable variability. Furthermore, the use of Mixed Poisson models is suggested as an effective approach for capturing the non-linear relationship between various risk factors and accident occurrence. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing a nuanced understanding of the application of GLM and factor analysis in the auto insurance sector, particularly in emerging markets.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years, Algeria has seen a sharp rise in the frequency of car accidents: more than 32,200 accidents in 2022, more than 636,697 in 2023, and 12,162 accidents in the first half of 2024, according to the National Road Safety Delegation. Tens of thousands of traffic accidents are reported to the appropriate authorities (National Gendarmerie, Civil Protection, etc.) each year, requiring a significant investment of time and money. Consequently, numerous files are presented to insurance companies seeking reimbursement. Due to the delay in paying out compensation, this has a detrimental effect on both the financial performance of these businesses and consumer loyalty.</p><p>The insurance business uses the theory of probability to compute losses, which is the basis for determining premiums, because it is uncertain to estimate the incidence of traffic accidents due to randomness. The distribution of accident rates must be understood in order to develop a deterministic method for pricing auto accidents. Since the number of accidents is random, we need to know how accidents are distributed. Any combination of variables that follows the Bernoulli distribution leads to the binomial distribution; however, if the number of observations is large and the probability of success is small, the binomial distribution will approximate the Poisson distribution as a mathematical expectation. For a single driver, it is a random variable that takes the values 1 if the accident occurs and 0 if it does not; we have Bernoulli's law with probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Denuit et al., 2007</xref>). However, a single driver can cause multiple accidents, and the insurance company's portfolio contains a large number of insurance policies.</p><p>Hence, the Poisson distribution occupies the main role in modeling independent and counting data because it is adapted as a model where there is only randomness and within a homogeneous population. However, these two conditions are not always met in the case of modeling insurance-related data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Veysseyre, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we resort to Mixed Poisson models (negative binomial) to describe populations consisting of an infinite number of homogeneous subpopulations. In this research, we are trying to answer the following question: How is the frequency of vehicle accidents distributed in Algeria?</p><p>This leads us to test the following hypothesis: The frequency of vehicle accidents in Algeria follows a negative binomial law.</p><p>For this end, we began with a literature review, and then we should focus on a theoretical examination of risk distribution models. Additionally, we used generalized linear models and factor analysis to model the number of accidents. Before delving into the specifics of the generalized linear models for the study data, we provided a theoretical analysis of the last two concepts by outlining the various types of factor analysis, including basic coefficient analysis, cross factor analysis, generalized cross factor analysis, and mixed factor analysis.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Lemaire (1985)</xref> remarked, of all types of non-life insurance, automobile third party undoubtedly gives rise to the most heated debate. This type of study has been a source of interest to many scholars, who have investigated some of the elements mentioned in this study, including:</p><p>In the first study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Ghali (2002)</xref> examined a marginal pricing model for auto insurance in a regulated market. The study's aim was to use the marginal model to analyze the Tunisian auto insurance pricing system; to do this, the researcher employed a pricing model based on before and after characteristics. The study was carried out at the level of a significant private Tunisian company that held 7% of the country's auto insurance market between 1990 and 1995. The study's sample consisted of 46,337 observations that were distributed annually during the same time period. From this sample and using counting models (Poisson and negative binomial), the importance of factors explaining vehicle accidents was estimated from the annual data, as well as the formation of marginal bonus and penalty tables (bonus-malus).</p><p>The findings were that the Tunisian pricing system and the reward and penalty system are not marginal, as evidenced by the presence of other variables in addition to puissance and usage that are significant and explain the number of accidents.</p><p>A study on pricing and segmentation in auto insurance was carried out on the French insurance company Mutant d'Assurance by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Guillaume (2010)</xref>. The study examined the company's operations in 2008 by examining all auto insurance policies with at least one day of guarantee during that year, as well as the losses that were reported during that same year. The following models were used in this study to develop models for the number of accidents and the amount of losses independently using generalized linear models (GLMs) after the data had been processed and corrected using factor analysis: Poisson, quasi-Poisson and gamma. The results obtained through this study are as follows: Building a pricing model for auto insurance based on generalized linear models and presenting a methodology for segmentation analysis in auto insurance pricing. </p><p>The third study examined the factors that influence the frequency of losses in auto insurance and was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Vasechko et al. (2009)</xref>. This study was conducted on a sample of 50,000 observations in a French insurance company; the data of this sample are 4-wheel tourist cars during the year 2005. Typically, counting models (Poisson and negative binomial models) are used to model accident frequency in this study, which aims to identify the factors that explain the number of liability accidents reported by the insured to the insurer. However, a significant portion of the insureds in the insurance portfolio may have no recorded losses during the insurance period (year); this zero value may indicate either no loss or no declaration. In order to capture the importance of these null values as well as the heterogeneity in the study population, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models that follow a non-binomial distribution (ZINB) were used. Variables explaining the frequency of losses are the same as in classical counting models, except that the choice of contract suggests an adverse selection effect. Findings are organized as follows: Results related to the Poisson model and the negative binomial model; results related to the ZIP and ZINB models; and then the comparison between the models.</p><p>Regarding the Poisson model and the negative binomial model, the study demonstrated that both models generated the same significant variables with comparable outcomes. The relationship between these variables was as follows: the type of driver, i.e., whether the insured is the same driver or not; the damage guarantee on the car in the three cases (with an important exemption, medium exemption, and weak exemption); the age of the car; the age of the license; and the bonus and penalty factor. While the other elements reduce the likelihood of recurring losses, the age of the vehicle and the reward and penalty factors increase it. However, because of the over dispersion in the data, the negative binomial model is a better fit for the data than the Poisson model.</p><p>Since it has already been stated how important it is for insureds to have no allowed losses (i.e., zero documented losses), the aforementioned models (ZIP and ZINB) were used, and the following outcomes were obtained: </p><p>The first part, which deals with the frequency of losses, yields the same results as the classical counting models. The second part, which deals with data that has been inflated with zero values, shows that the probability of loss decreases according to the bonus and penalty coefficient and increases with the age of the car, the driver's license, and the damage guarantee on the car with an average exemption. To compare all these models, the Vuong test was used, and the result obtained was that a ZIP model is favored over the standard Poisson model, and a ZINB model is favored over a negative binomial model. Finally, ZINB is recommended as the final model. </p><p>In the following study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Lai (2011)</xref> examined the development of a model to assess the risk of traffic accidents in urban areas using the Structural Equation Model. Because there are many variables influencing the occurrence of accidents, the researcher restricted them to three dimensions: driver characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and road characteristics. As a result, the study variables were determined to be as follows: The dependent variable: The risk of road traffic accidents, including both the risk realization rate, i.e., the number of accidents in relation to the number of vehicles, and the severity of the risk in relation to the number of deaths and injuries.</p><p>The explanatory variables, in turn, include driver characteristics (gender, age, license, and blood alcohol content); vehicle characteristics (vehicle type and traffic volume); and road characteristics (road width, road straightness, etc.).</p><p>The applied study was conducted in Taiwan Province (People’s Republic of China) with a coverage of 26 roads divided into 249 segments according to road characteristics; the data on accidents were obtained from the police office, and the study period lasted from 1 January to 31 December 2003.</p><p>He drew the following conclusions: Both the driver and road dimensions have the greatest impact on the realization of risk, while the car dimension is not statistically significant, and concluded that the most influential cause of accidents always remains human.</p><p>Locating the current study within previous studies: It is clear from the presentation of earlier research that a Poisson model and a negative binomial are required to model the number of vehicle accidents. Nevertheless, the data shows that there are many insured individuals with zero accidents, which may be due to the insured failing to report the accident or to other factors. To account for this situation, the author employed ZIP and ZINB models. Therefore, this study differs from previous studies in several points that we summarize:</p><p>In terms of work environment: Previous studies were conducted in foreign countries such as France, Taiwan, and Arab countries (Tunisia). The current study is concerned with the case of Algeria, considered as an emerging market.</p><p>In terms of objectives, the current study uses factor analysis to process and rectify the data in order to estimate the number of car accidents that occurred in the 2023/2024 period. It then uses generalized linear models to develop ZIP and ZINB models for the number of losses. The models listed above.</p>

            <title>2.1. Mixed poisson regression models</title>
          
          <p>The end of the 1970s saw the introduction of this kind of model into modern economic analysis, where the dependent variable is valid and non-negative in order to account for its quirks. Numerous studies have been conducted in this area, such as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Hausman et al. (1984)</xref> on the number of races in a specific time period; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Cameron &amp;amp; Trivedi (1986)</xref> on the number of doctor examinations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Dionne &amp;amp; Vanasse (1989)</xref> on the number of accidents; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Winkelmann (1995)</xref> on the frequency of job changes.</p><p>In general, a Poisson regression model can be defined as a model that relates a discrete dependent variable, which takes positive and valid values, to one or more explanatory variables. In order to use this model, the following conditions must be met:</p><p>- The instantaneous probability of loss is proportional to the length of the period under consideration.</p><p>- The instantaneous probability of an event occurring is constant over the period under consideration (i.e., the risk is constant in time).</p><p>- The probability of more than one event occurring is low.</p><p>- Accidents are independent of each other.</p><p>These conditions are consistent with the Poisson distribution, which is characterized as the law of instantaneous and independent accidents; if the probability of an individual being involved in an accident during a given period is equal to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Partrat &amp;amp; Besson, 2005</xref>):</p>

We have a probability that the loss is from the category of <italic>i</italic>, and <italic>Ni</italic> is the frequency of loss corresponding to that category.

Second, the Poisson distribution is consistent with these two assumptions, suggesting that the normality hypothesis may not be negative. However, because of the high number of missing values and the existence of some extreme values, the hypothesis of equality between mathematical expectation and variance, which implies the homogeneity of the portfolio with regard to risk, is severely constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">de Jong &amp;amp; Heller, 2008</xref>). Here, the variance exceeds the mean; we discuss a concept known as overdispersion of the variable <italic>N</italic>. This scenario necessitates a partial standard deviation estimation, which could lead to the null hypothesis regarding the estimator vector's dependability<italic> β </italic>in the model being rejected. By adding a new parameter that might represent the unobserved heterogeneity of the implicit variables that may contribute to this over-dispersion, the objective is to employ a different model that accounts for this over-dispersion. Mixed Poisson models are the models that address this problem.</p>

              <p>Since each driver or group of drivers has unique characteristics that influence the likelihood of traffic accidents, the society we are studying (the population of insured drivers) is heterogeneous. For this reason, we use Mixed Poisson models to examine the distribution of losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Lee et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Definition of the Mixed Poisson model: The Poisson distribution often shows an inadequate fit to the observations of the underwriter's portfolio due to heterogeneity among underwriters; here we multiply the average loss frequency <italic>λ</italic> by a positive random variable <italic>Θ</italic>, so the average loss realization becomes a random variable dependent on <italic>Θ</italic>. We choose <italic>Θ</italic>, so <italic>E</italic>(<italic>Θ</italic>)<italic>=1</italic> because we want to approximate the same frequency of occurrences in the portfolio under our condition <italic>Θ</italic>, we have:</p>

              <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Cragg (1971)</xref> developed various models to take into account the implicit variable mentioned above. In general, an event (e.g., buying an item, recognizing a loss...) may or may not occur. If the event does not materialize, this implicit variable takes a value of zero and is assumed to be an independent variable that takes positive values. The decision path is represented by the probit model, and the second event (number of incidents) is represented by the model defined in each case, so insureds with zero number of recorded losses (N=0) can be categorized into two categories:</p><p>A first category, none of which actually caused a loss.</p><p>Another group did not declare the accident because of its severity and to avoid the application of the penalty factor or to avoid the procedures for registering the accident.</p><p>This distinction is important for the insurer, as it can be conjectured that not declaring an accident for which the insured is responsible indicates that the risk is small, as the latter does not take the measures to declare it in order to preserve certain privileges, some of which we have already mentioned, but this does not mean that the insured has become a risk to the insurer.</p><p>The Poisson and negative binomial models do not allow us to distinguish between these two categories; however, the ZIP and ZINB models generate two separate models to be linked, which were developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Greene (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Lambert (1992)</xref> and assume only that zero and strictly positive values are generated by the same process.</p><p>Compared to the aforementioned Poisson and negative binomial models, here we assume that the random variable is the product of a binary law and Poisson's law (in the case of ZIP), or a negative binomial law (in the case of ZINB).</p>

          <p>The study population, which includes all auto insurance policies with yearly underwriting periods at agencies and insurance intermediaries connected to the Algerian Insurance Company’s (SAA) regional directorate in Setif in 2023, as well as the losses reported during that time, must be defined before discussing the data collection method.</p><p>The process was carried out manually, and the data was only a sample of 520 units (insurance policies) underwritten in 2023; it was not exhaustive because it is not feasible. However, it was observed that:</p><p>- The process was done manually because there is no technology available to obtain the combined data digitally.</p><p>- The variable ageP, i.e., the age of the driver's license, is not expressed by the first date of issuance, but by the year of its renewal, and was therefore excluded from the study.</p><p>- The variable val-V, i.e., the price of the insured vehicle, is only known in the case of the theft and fire or comprehensive warranty and was also excluded from the study.</p><p>The study variables were defined as shown in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>3.2.1 Generalized linear model</title>
              
              <p>In simple linear models, the dependent variable is expressed by a single explanatory variable,<italic> X</italic>. Whereas, in multiple models it is expressed by several explanatory variables<italic> X<sub>i</sub></italic>; in classical linear models, instead of expressing the dependent variable <italic>Y</italic>, it is expressed by its mathematical expectation <italic>E</italic>(<italic>Y</italic>/<italic>X</italic>), whereas in generalized linear models (GLM) it is expressed by a cupulas, in order to interpret, we create a cupula between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> as we will detail below.</p><p>In 1972, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Nelder &amp;amp; Wedderburn (1972)</xref> presented generalized linear models, which, like previous models, seek to determine the relationship between the explanatory and dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Compain, 2010</xref>). The diagram that follows provides a summary of how to design a generalized linear model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Nelder &amp;amp; Wedderburn, 1972</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> shows that choosing a <italic>y</italic> law from the exponential family is the first step in creating a generalized linear model.</p><p>The following functions: <italic>a</italic>(), <italic>b</italic>(), <italic>c</italic>(), are determined by first independently estimating the dispersion parameter, which we later deem constant, in order to apply the generalized linear model as a general rule of thumb. Then choose the cupula. The parameters (<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>, …,<sub> </sub><italic>β</italic><sub>p</sub>) must then be estimated, in order to stabilize <italic>η</italic>(<italic>X</italic>) and thus determine <italic>μ</italic> = <italic>g</italic><sup>-1</sup>(<italic>η</italic>(<italic>X</italic>)) considered as a mean (expectation) of the model, which is finally stabilized <italic>θ</italic> which can be defined by <italic>θ = </italic>(<italic>b</italic>’)<sup>-1</sup>(<italic>μ</italic>), which also allows for the calculation of the variance function <italic>V</italic>(<italic>μ</italic>), <italic>y</italic> variance. The aim of using cupula is to make the error variance more stable, and the simplest choice of cupula that simplifies calculations is choosing <italic>g</italic> that achieves <italic>g = </italic>(<italic>b</italic>’)<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

              <p>In linear regression, we perform model fit tests from the sum of the residuals, while in generalized linear models we theoretically focus on Pearson and plausibility tests. To do this, we define the so-called model deviation as well as the Pearson statistic.</p><p>Estimating β with <inline-formula>

              <p>Therefore, we are now going to highlight a factor analysis of the mixed data using all the variables. Since the full study is quite large, we will not review all the results, but only focus on the most significant and important ones. Furthermore, we will not go into the details of results similar to those obtained in the multivariate component analysis example. We will begin by performing an AFDM on a table containing all the affected individuals, defined by all the explanatory variables. We will refer to the table in question as TabAFDM and list the names of the variables used below.</p><p>&amp;amp;gt; names(TabAFDM)</p><p>[1] "Agec" "B.M" "ageV" "puissance" "Nb" "sinistre" </p><p>[7] "Type" "sexe" "garantie" "usage"</p><p>The first six variables are quantitative variables, while the next four are qualitative variables. </p><p>Therefore, the output of the statistical program R will be through the following commands.</p><p>From the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, we can deduce several pieces of information. Firstly, we notice that the variables usage and garantie are correlated, so to improve the factor analysis and reduce noise, it is necessary to keep one of them, usage, as the dependent variable.</p><p>Next, to further express the variables, we categorize quantitative variables into qualitative variables (categories), which facilitates joint analyses. We rely on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Charpentier (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Ghali (2002)</xref> for our categorization.</p><p>The R outputs are as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

              <p>We may infer a great deal of information from the graph. First, we observe that the variables <italic>b-m</italic>, a<italic>geV</italic>, and <italic>usage</italic> are correlated. Because the agencies of the same organization are independent of one another, <italic>b-m</italic> can be removed from the study because it frequently fails to capture the true value of the reward and penalty coefficient, that is, it lacks memory. While <italic>usage</italic> clearly affects the number of losses, we keep the variable <italic>ageV</italic> since it has a higher effect on the amount of losses; the younger the automobile, the more guarantees and compensation.</p><p>The final representation of the factor analysis is as above, showing the independence between the variables.</p>

      <p>As can be shown, the probability value (Pr(Chi)) is not less than 0.05 because it does not appear. We get to the conclusion that there is little statistical support for the idea that the more intricate model (Model 2) offers a noticeably better match than the more straightforward model (Model 1). We can choose the Poisson model as a marginal model by comparing the AIC criterion for all models, which takes the values of 735 in the Poisson model, 734.3 in the negative binomial model, 740.2736 in the ZINB model, and 738.2736 in the ZIP model.</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This work highlights the need for a rigorous statistical technique, particularly GLM, in simulating auto accidents. This methodology can help insurance companies improve their risk management and underwriting processes. The results of this study can serve as a basis for more research and the development of policies aimed at reducing the number of traffic accidents in Algeria. </p><p>This study shows that the company's pricing mechanism is non-deterministic since other factors affect the price process. Based on the findings, the general model that was recommended as being most suitable for the business under study (SAA) is the Poisson model as a marginal model.</p>
