      <abstract><p>The present work is focused on the simulation of Casson (non-Newtonian) nanofluid flow over an inclined stretching sheet. The study considers the influence of an imposed magnetic field, heat source/sink, thermal radiation and chemical reaction under the multi slip effects. The study includes the application of wall suction/injection and Navier's first-order slip to analyse the velocity, temperature, and concentration at the wall. The governing equations have been transformed into nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with similarity transformations. By employing the homotopy analysis method (HAM), we have successfully derived the numerical solution for the nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their corresponding boundary conditions. The impact of various parameters on the velocity, temperature, and concentration field has also been demonstrated. Multiple slip flow is utilised in various practical domains like micro-electro-mechanical systems, nano-electro-mechanical systems, micro-organism flow, and rarefied gas flow, among others.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The unique thermal, mechanical, and chemical properties of nanofluids, a mixture of nanoparticles adjourned in a base fluid, make them perfect for enlightening lubrication, increasing thermal conductivity, and improving the performance of a variety of systems. The study of nanofluid dynamics is still in its early stages, with efforts being made to create new nanofluid formulations, increase their stability, forecast their behaviour in various scenarios, and improve their performance in a range of applications. It is true that Choi and Eastman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] significantly advanced in the field of nanomaterials. Their research concentrated on using nanoparticles to increase a fluid's thermal conductivity. The addition of a small amount of nanoparticles in heat transfer fluids results in the new thermal phenomena of nanofluids (nanoparticle-fluid suspensions) reported by Pil Jang and Choi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Meyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] investigated computational techniques for studying fluid dynamics, while focusing on numerical approaches to nanofluid flow analysis. Akbari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] researched on the comparisons between different concepts of fluid flow likely looks at the benefits and distinctions between different models for fluid behaviour prediction. Wong and De Leon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] engrossed in dispensing an extensive scope of present and anticipated nanofluid applications, stressing their more controllable heat allocation abilities and the unique properties that make nanofluids appropriate for such uses.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Due to of its wide-ranging applications and implications, non-Newtonian fluid flow requires careful study and modelling in the industrial and engineering sectors. Unlike Newtonian fluids like water or air, non-Newtonian fluids lacked to investigate the direct association between shear tension and shear proportion. Rather, variables such as shear rate, time, or stress can affect their viscosity. For a variety of industries, careful and precise modelling of the behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids is essential. As an illustration: Non-Newtonian fluids are frequently found in the production of paints, food products, and polymers. A wide range of food products, including dough, sauces, and creams, behave in ways that are not Newtonian. Siddappa and Abel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] considered the study of boundary layer flow past a stretching plate in non-Newtonian like visco-elastic fluid flow. Different non-Newtonian nanofluid flows are purposefully designed by Khan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] for abundant configuration.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Because of their relationship between shear stress and strain, Casson fluids are non-Newtonian due to their sole rheological characteristics. These fluids are appropriate for shear diluting implementation because of their notable shear viscosity and yield stress. In the beginning, Casson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] introduced the Casson fluid model for silicon dissolution and gel pens. Human blood, concentrated fruit liquids, jellies, honey, soups, and tomato sauces are a few examples of Casson fluids. In a stretching sheet, Dandapat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] examined about stability of MHD path in a viscoelastic liquid or gas, while Fang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] investigated the extended Blasius equation. Mamalouka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] discussed about the difference in solving the second order problems on a fluid that flows over an augmentation. This condition is expected to be mixed convection within the particular field when forced convection and free/natural convection cooperate to facilitate easier heat transfer. The enhanced thermal transference for miscellaneous Casson flow of nanofluid influence by external magnetism over a rotating sheet was investigated by Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Intentional aspects of the temperature and molar variation with respect to Arrhenius activation energy are discussed by Alsallami et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows are driven by curiosity and application: they are recycled to treat cancerous tumours, reduce bleeding from surgical wounds, distribute specific medications using magnetic particles, and detect illness using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study of MHD examines the relationship between magnetic fields and fluid flow, which is a branch of mathematics. The MHD boundary layer flow above a permeable elongation area finds petition claims in the trade of crystal Fiber, paper crafting, plasma education, fuel trades, MHD control producer, boundary regulator in aero mechanics and fear of fissionable containers. Many conceptual as well as creative investigations caused some researchers to argue. Ishak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] observed (MHD) boundary layer movement brought on by an increasing rapidly elongating sheet with radiation outcome. The viscosity factor of a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) nanofluid is discussed by Shahid et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] and is dependent on temperature. As a result of its abundant tenders in engineering complications, the influence of an outermost magnetic field on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) deluge a lengthening area of spreading is highly notable in the field of fluid mechanics. The impact of an outward applied magnetism on Magnetohydrodynamics flow across an elongating membrane was examined by Pavlov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Anderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] examined the viscous fluid MHD flow at the end of a stretching sheet. The distribution of heat away from the surface is largely influenced by thermal radiation. It has claims in trade industries like space exploration, missiles, atomic furnaces, planetary vehicles, choppers, satellites, and actions involving high temperatures. More grades regarding the movement of a nanofluid in the occurrence of mass as well as heat were noted in the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. An elemental response has broad tenders that cover the destruction of crops by freezing, food distribution, newspaper exchange, ventilation, tile work, sunstroke protocols, and river suspensions and petroleum. Seyedi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] framework is ideal for mathematically analysing the influence of a biological response to direct heat emission on an embracing Eyring-Powell fluid channel distortion. It is feasible to implement a no-slip boundary condition when the fluid particles are near the external and are unable to transfer along with it or after the bond expires coherence. Viscous liquids prevent this marvel from happening because smooth walls sufficient, a firm surface may cause them to slip. In many situations, including wire mesh rough surfaces, greased surfaces, and covered surfaces, slip conditions become important. The change in uses characteristic of nature and modern technology has led to an important amplification in count, heat, and mass transport along with chemical reactions. Fluid flow involves chemical processes such as refrigeration fortifications, mist generation, and ceramic business. The integral transform analysis of mass and heat diffusion of chemically reacting systems with Michaelis–Menten kinetics was prepared by Pinheiro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">The mass flow caused by a temperature gradient is indicated by the Soret result. The Soret effect has been incorporated by numerous researchers into their studies to discuss these issues and emphasize their significance. The learning of the boundary layer flow produced by an elongating sheet was primarily done by Crane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. He provided a precise fix for the initial issue. As time has passed by, the boundary layer flow over regular and irregular widening of surface areas has piqued the enormous interest of numerous researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. The reputation of mutable nanomaterial radius for the non-Newtonian flow of nanofluid promoted through a stretching sheet is discussed by Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. An elastic limit that is similar to the constant harvest tension in Casson fluid occurs, if the rouleaux entertains similar an elastic solid studied by Fung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. The ideal point flow and heat allocation in a Casson fluid flow ended an elongating plate are discussed by Mustafa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. Shehzad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] supplied a thoughtful answer to the stable boundaryed layer flow of a Casson fluid above an absorbent elongating plate. Investigators have been captivated by the potential of exponentially stretching cylinders in a variety of domains, such as polymer dispensation, purification, biomedical tenders, and energy change systems. An investigation into the analogous determination of the flow features and transmission of heat inside a constant Casson-based nanofluid stirring diagonally crosswise erectly situated cylinder exposed to spreading radial extension was guided by Naseer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Merkin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] observed the thermal features of the boundaryed sheet flow at a recession fact connecting a volumetric curve that causes exponentially stretched sheet. Malik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>] investigated cautiously the comparable conclusions regarding the flow properties and heat exchange of a stable Casson-based nanofluid applied inclined to a vertically positioned cylinder subjected to exponential radial stretching sheet. The combination of a magnetic field and a heat source affects on Casson nanofluid flow in a stable boundary layer, as done by Sarojamma and Vendabai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. In measuring thermophoretic diffusion properties and Brownian motion, Mustafa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] examined the merged convective move of magneto-nanofluid that was controlled by vertical stretched plate. Awais et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>] measured the outcomes of heat source/sink and mass and heat transfer on Casson fluid flow through a vertically exponentially stretched/shrinking sheet using mathematical analysis. Zhai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] have derived the relation between the mass transfer and heat structures for a variety of disorders and absorbers. Thermal and stratification characteristics of non-Newtonian fluid passes through a porous medium was investigated by Megahed and Abbas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. Through the use of FDM, Barik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>] examined the impact of multiple slips effects on the flow of MHD nanofluids over an inclined, radiative, and chemically reactive stretched sheet.</p><p style="text-align: justify">We found that a very few studies have investigated the thermo-hydro-dynamics properties of Casson and nanofluid over an inclined stretching sheet by taking into account all the different phenomena, including variables like magnetic field, linear radiation, an external heat source/sink, and the chemical reaction, from the aforementioned literature survey. It is anticipated that slip exists at the surface in this investigation because nanofluid has been used as the working fluid. To analyze these phenomena, the research employs established similarity variables, converting the primary partial differential equations (PDEs) into a set of interconnected ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs are numerically resolved by using employing the homotopy analysis method (HAM), This methodology ensures the generation of robust data across various parameters. To validate the computed results, a comparative analysis is performed against existing research data. The research makes a significant contribution to our understanding of non-Newtonian nanofluid flow by elucidating the complex interactions among various elements that govern micro rotational transport in a non-Newtonian nanofluid, as characterized by the Casson nanofluid model.</p>

</inline-formula>B_0$ has been applied normal to the x-axis, and over the entire fluid domain. In the present study, the effects of the thermal radiation, chemical reaction, and the buoyancy on the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles in the presence of the multiple slip conditions at the wall are considered under suction/injection. External heat source/sink is also considered in the energy equation. The body force terms due to the thermal and concentration gradients are included in the momentum equation. The properties of Brownian motion and thermophoresis are considered.</p>

Additionally, we elucidate the parameters associations between these profiles and important dimensionless variables, such as the skin friction coefficient, the local Nusselt number and the local Sherwood number. In order to shed light on these connections, we employ a set of informative graphs. As a way to preserve coherence with the numerical results generated in this study, we strictly follow the predetermined values shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, unless there are specific deviations indicated in the relevant figures.</p>

</inline-formula>M$ increases, the Lorentz force which limits fluid motion increases, which causes the rate of transport to decrease. When the magnetic field was applied over the flow field, the Lorentz force became apparent. This force is strong enough to slow down the fluid's flow and drag it along. As a result, fluid flow velocity decreases as momentum layer thickness increases.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Based on numerical studies conducted using a HAM technique, the following results were drawn regarding the MHD properties of a Casson nanofluid flowing over an inclined stretching sheet that was stretched linearly:</p><p style="text-align: justify">(i) The decrease in nanofluid velocity is proportional to the Casson parameter, the magnetic parameter and velocity slip factor. The thermal radiation parameter, the Brownian motion, the heat source parameter, and all contribute to an increase in the nanofluid's temperature.</p><p style="text-align: justify">(ii) The solution boundary layer grows as the Casson parameter, thermophoresis parameter does, but it shrinks as Nb shrinks.</p><p style="text-align: justify">(iii) There is a correlation between the velocity slip parameter and an increase in the heat and mass transfer rates. However, the rate of heat transfer and the rate of mass transfer both decrease as the temperature jump parameter values increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify">(iv) It has been observed that the Nusselt number and the Sherwood number drop when the magnetic parameter increases. Through the process of velocity slip, both the Nusselt number and the Sherwood number fall.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Future scope: It is possible that the current work could be expanded to include the non-Newtonian flow over a nonlinear stretching sheet in our subsequent research activities.</p>
