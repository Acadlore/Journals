      <abstract><p>The increasing global energy crisis and concerns about environmental impacts are driving the development of efficient and low-cost renewable energy systems. Solar water heaters (SWH) are an alternative, specifically in tropical countries such as Indonesia, which receive solar radiation intensity of 4–6 kWh/m$^2$/day. Therefore, this study aimed to model the thermal performance of trickle-flow SWH using a lightweight composite material called polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as cover and galvalume for the heat absorber plate, which has previously been validated through experiments. The simulation model was developed using a transient lumped-parameter energy balance method and was implemented in Python with minute-by-minute interpolated meteorological data. Model validation was conducted by comparing simulated and experimental inlet and outlet temperatures. It reproduced the main temperature trends and peak values observed in the experiments. Statistical evaluation further indicated a high level of accuracy, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of up to 0.81℃ and a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of 0.986 for outlet temperature. Additional parametric analyses showed the effects of flow rate and tank volume on thermal efficiency. These effects were visualized using efficiency contour plots, while confidence bands were applied to present simulation uncertainty. In general, the results confirmed the feasibility of using lightweight materials in solar collectors and showed the capability of numerical-statistical models for performance prediction as well as design optimization. These findings supported the development of efficient and low-cost SWH systems for tropical regions.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The global energy crisis, largely driven by continued dependence on fossil fuels, has intensified the search for clean, efficient, and sustainable alternative energy solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Among the available renewable options, solar energy holds a strategic position, particularly in tropical countries such as Indonesia, which receive a high level of solar radiation intensity throughout the year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Having an average solar radiation potential of 4–6 kWh/m²/day, the country has substantial opportunities to deploy solar energy technologies, especially solar water heaters (SWH), for both domestic and commercial applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>SWH represents a practically relevant application of solar energy because of the simple construction, low operational costs, and ability to directly replace fossil-based energy for water heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. In this context, an economically attractive configuration is the open flow (trickle flow) system, which uses a heat absorber plate and a lightweight, transparent cover. Materials such as galvalume for the absorber and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) for the cover provide advantages in terms of low weight, ease of fabrication, and reduced production costs when compared with conventional metals such as copper or aluminum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies showed that the thermal performance of SWH systems was strongly influenced by collector orientation, system configuration, and the material used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. An experimental investigation of a trickle-flow SWH equipped with a lightweight PMMA–galvalume configuration evaluated four collector orientations, namely east, east +30°, south, and north. The results signified that the east-facing orientation achieved the highest thermal efficiency, reaching 32.7%, and produced a maximum outlet water temperature of 45.8℃. These outcomes showed that, in tropical climates, SWH performance could be substantially improved through appropriate orientation selection combined with the use of lightweight materials.</p><p>The predictability and generalizability of purely experimental results are limited, particularly when a wide range of system parameters should be explored. Therefore, numerical methods based on mathematical simulation are essential for conducting broader and more efficient analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. This study focuses on the development of a transient numerical model to simulate the thermal behavior of a lightweight trickle-flow SWH, which is validated using experimental data. The model is implemented in Python as a numerical computation platform. By incorporating microclimate variables, including global solar radiation (<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>), the model represents the transient temperature dynamics of the SWH system. These meteorological inputs are interpolated on a minute-by-minute basis to enable accurate prediction of both inlet and outlet fluid temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>Model validation is conducted through a direct comparison between simulated and experimental data, with particular priority on the east orientation, which has been identified as optimal. Model accuracy is evaluated using statistical indicators, including the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (<inline-formula>

      <mml:mi>R</mml:mi>
      <mml:mn>2</mml:mn>
    </mml:msup>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>). These metrics quantify the magnitude of the absolute error, the presence of systematic bias, and the degree of agreement between the model predictions and the measured data, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Following the discussion, the results signify that the model reproduces the experimental temperature trends with high accuracy, producing an MAE of 0.81℃ and an <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> value of 0.986 for the outlet temperature.</p><p>Most existing studies on SWH system modeling focused on closed systems using selective coatings in a flat plate collector (FPC) configuration. The importance of selecting collector orientation based on user consumption patterns was explained by Khanghahi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Yunianto reported an efficiency increase of up to 40.55% when the collector was oriented at east +30° and equipped with a single pane of glass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Consequently, numerical models for open SWH systems with trickle flow configuration constructed from lightweight materials and applied in tropical regions remained scarce. Relating to the discussion, only a limited number of studies had addressed their development and validation.</p><p>This study addresses the identified gap through three principal contributions. First, the analysis develops a thermal numerical model for a trickle-flow-based SWH system constructed using lightweight materials, which is validated against experimental data. Second, the accuracy of the proposed model is evaluated using comprehensive statistical indicators, namely, RMSE, MAE, MBE, and <inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>. Third, this study assesses the applicability of the model as a tool for supporting the design and optimization of efficient and affordable SWH systems, respectively. In addition, the proposed framework provides a basis for extending the analysis to other operational parameters, such as variations in flow rate, tank capacity, and alternative absorber materials.</p>

The use of Python served solely as a computational platform for data management, time stepping, and visualization. This did not affect the physical formulation or validation of the model. The model incorporated dynamic collector efficiency formulas, flow corrections, and heat-loss calculations for both the collector and the storage tank. In addition, Major input parameters included the heat transfer coefficient, fluid mass, and specific heat capacity. Simulation results were directly compared with experimental measurements to evaluate model accuracy and explain potential deviations arising from environmental factors or measurement errors.</p>

            <title>2.4. Numerical model</title>
          
          <p>This study developed a numerical model to simulate the thermal performance of a galvalume-collector-based SWH system. The simulations were implemented in Python due to its flexibility in data processing, visualization, and integration with thermodynamic equations. During the process, the model was formulated using a discrete-time per-minute method to correspond with the temporal resolution of the experimental observations. </p>

              <p>Several assumptions were adopted during the analysis to simplify the numerical calculations. The water flow was assumed to be steady at each minute, with a Reynolds number (<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>) below 2000, justifying the use of a laminar flow regime. Heat conduction in the galvalume absorber plate was considered one-dimensional due to its very small thickness. In addition, radiative heat losses to the sky and the ambient environment were combined into a single overall heat-loss coefficient (<inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>). Water in the storage tank was assumed to be perfectly mixed, leading to a uniform tank temperature at each time step. Additionally, the heat capacity of the absorber plate was neglected to improve computational efficiency, and this assumption was examined further in the sensitivity analysis. Relating to these assumptions, the Python-based model generated temperature predictions that were subsequently validated against experimental data.</p>

              <p>In the SWH system, collector efficiency was strongly influenced by the temperature difference between the fluid and the environment as well as by the intensity of solar radiation. During the process, the energy absorbed by the collector was calculated as the difference between the incoming solar radiation energy and the heat losses to the environment.</p><p>•Collector total heat loss coefficient:</p>

              <p>The mixing process in the storage tank was assumed to be perfect, signifying that the water temperature in the tank was uniform at each time step due to mixing induced by the inlet flow. The model used a mass-and-energy balance method to calculate the updated average tank temperature, considering both the inlet water temperature (<inline-formula>

In this study, the heat loss was subtracted from the total energy in the tank at each time step to improve the accuracy of temperature predictions. Furthermore, the model simulated the process dynamically with a minute-by-minute resolution, enabling accurate representation of temperature fluctuations from variations in solar radiation and environmental conditions.</p><p>•Mixing of the incoming fluid and the fluid in the tank:</p>

          <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> shows the simulation workflow used to model the thermal performance of a lightweight trickle-flow SWH. The process started with input of experimental data and system parameters, followed by preprocessing steps such as data interpolation and assignment. The core of the model was a minute-based simulation loop, which calculated heat loss coefficient, flow factor, and net energy gain at each time step. The tank temperature was then updated based on mixing and losses. After the completion of the simulation loop, the results were validated statistically (e.g., RMSE, MBE) and visualized through temperature trends, efficiency contours, and confidence bands. Parametric studies were subsequently conducted to evaluate the influence of flow rate and tank volume on system performance.</p>

          <p>The simulation successfully replicated the decreasing temperature trend observed after 2:00 p.m. This showed consistency in the model’s predictions of system performance. The accuracy of the model during the process was quantified using RMSE. For the collector orientation due east, the RMSE was 0.9℃. Maeanwhile, the RMSE increased slightly to 1.4℃ for the east +30° orientation.</p><p>The low RMSE value showed that the difference between the simulation results and the experimental data were relatively small and acceptable for a household-scale SWH system. Previous studies recommended that an RMSE less than 2℃ represented high accuracy for numerical models of solar collectors. Accordingly, the model developed in this study was considered valid and capable of realistically capturing heat transfer dynamics of the system. These results reinforced the utility of the model as a reliable tool for simulating the performance and guiding the design of the collector systems under varying environmental conditions.</p><p>During the analysis, a significant deviation was observed around 12:30 p.m, when the experimental data showed a decrease in temperature despite an increase in <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>) and the total heating capacity of the system. At low flow rates, the water temperature rise is high, but the total stored energy is limited due to the small volume of water circulated. At high flow rates, more total energy is stored, although each liter of water experiences a smaller temperature increase. The analysis helps identify the optimal operating point, depending on how the system prioritizes water temperature (quality) or total energy storage (quantity). These perceptions are crucial for practical applications, such as selecting an appropriate circulation pump and designing a suitably sized tank for household or small-scale industrial SWH systems.</p>

            <title>3.3. Analysis of collector efficiency contour based on flow rate and tank volume</title>
          
          <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> shows a contour graph signifying the relationship between fluid flow rate and tank volume on the efficiency of the solar collector. The curved contour pattern indicated that an optimal combination of these two variables existed to achieve maximum efficiency. At very low flow rates, collector efficiency decreased due to overheating and excessive heat accumulation. Meanwhile, at higher flow rates, efficiency decreased because of reduced fluid residence time. Tank volume also influenced temperature stability, as a smaller tank could not store energy optimally, and a larger tank might experience greater heat losses.</p>

          <p>The contour chart provides a valuable visual tool for the design of future SWH systems. By identifying the optimal zone for the combination of flow rate and tank volume, designers can develop systems that balance size, efficiency, and production cost. This information is particularly useful for creating compact SWH systems that achieve maximum performance suitable for residential applications or remote areas with limited space and budget. Furthermore, the chart aids designers in selecting system configurations that are well-adapted to local climate conditions.</p>

          <p>The RMSE metric is used to assess how accurately the numerical model represents experimental conditions. RMSE is widely used in numerical modeling because it quantifies the average magnitude of error between the simulation results and the observed data. A smaller RMSE value indicates that the model predictions closely approximate the actual system behavior.</p><p>In this study, RMSE was used to assess the accuracy of the model for the collector <inline-formula>

          <p>Based on the statistical evaluation results, the following discussion examined the consistency and reliability of the model in representing system performance under various operating conditions. This ensured that the observed agreement was not limited to a single experimental configuration. Although the experimental validation in this study was conducted using one test setup, the correspondence between the numerical model and the measured data was supported by consistent trends observed in the parametric analysis. Variations in mass flow rate and storage tank volume produced systematic and predictable changes in outlet water temperature and overall system efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. An increase in mass flow rate generally decreased the outlet temperature and improved system efficiency. Meanwhile, a larger storage tank volume improved temperature stability and thermal performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. These responses were consistent with the well-established behavior of solar thermal systems. The process indicated that the agreement between the model experimental results was not incidental to specific test conditions.</p>

This behavior showed a fundamental trade-off between heating quality and quantity.</p><p>The simulations signified that collector efficiency was strongly influenced by the interaction between fluid flow rate and storage tank volume. The efficiency contours analysis showed the existence of an optimal operating region in which a balance between flow rate and tank volume maximized collector performance. Following the discussion, an excessively low flow rate led to overheating and heat accumulation in the collector. Meanwhile, an excessively high flow rate reduced the fluid residence time, decreasing the amount of heat absorbed and lowering overall efficiency.</p><p>The model successfully validated the experimental results and provided reliable observations for the design and optimization of lightweight SWH systems. This method would be crucial for the development of efficient, economical, and suitable SWH systems for tropical regions such as Indonesia.</p><p>Further evaluation is required to ensure that the predictive capability of the SWH system can be maintained under a wider range of operating conditions, even though the results obtained show promising model performance. Therefore, the current validation should be considered an initial verification of the proposed lumped-parameter model. Future studies should focus on extending the experimental validation by incorporating variations in operating conditions. In addition, the studies should also focus on different collector orientations and longer measurement periods to more comprehensively assess the generalizability as well as the robustness of the model.</p>
