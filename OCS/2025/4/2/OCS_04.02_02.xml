      <abstract><p>A comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted to examine the evolution of scientific research on climate change and drought from 2013 to 2023. A dataset comprising 28,950 peer-reviewed publications was compiled from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, followed by rigorous data cleaning and standardization procedures. Analytical tools, including VOSviewer and CiteSpace, were employed to map keyword co-occurrence networks, author collaborations, and citation dynamics. The results revealed that co-authorship patterns were characterized by extensive global collaboration, with the United States (7,565 publications; 99,657 citations) and China (5,552 publications; 36,207 citations) identified as the leading contributors. Prominent institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences (1,945 publications) emerged as central nodes within international research networks. Keyword co-occurrence analysis highlighted dominant thematic clusters, including “ecosystem responses” (12,212 occurrences), “water availability,” and “climate models”, indicating strong interdisciplinary linkages across environmental, agricultural, and geoscientific domains. Citation analysis pinpointed highly influential journals, with Science of the Total Environment (756 publications in 2013) and Water (Switzerland) (484 in 2014) noted for their substantial academic impact. Notable authors, such as J.J. Camarero (148 documents), were recognized for sustained scholarly contributions. A marked upward trend in publication volume was observed, with annual outputs increasing by 230%, from 1,394 documents in 2013 to 4,597 in 2023, reflecting intensified global attention on climate-induced drought. Funding analysis showed that 22,630 publications acknowledged financial support, predominantly from agencies such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Subject area distribution revealed a concentration in environmental sciences (28.5%), agricultural sciences (23.7%), and earth sciences (14.4%), underscoring the multifaceted nature of drought-related climate research. Network visualizations further demonstrated that the United States held the highest total link strength (5,240), followed by China (3,520), suggesting leadership in collaborative intensity. The integration of citation frequencies, publication trends, and thematic evolution provided a robust framework for identifying existing research gaps, informing mitigation strategies, and guiding science-based policy development. The findings underscore the urgency of addressing climate-related drought through enhanced international cooperation and the application of advanced modeling frameworks, while also illustrating the evolving structure of this research domain over the past decade.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Analysis has shown that climate change intensifies the frequency, duration, and intensity of droughts, leading to cascading effects on environments, food production, and water security. Bibliometric analyses reveal a rise in interdisciplinary research driven by the need to understand climate-related variables for changing patterns of precipitation, increased temperature levels and their relationship with drought phenomena. The most current research highlights regional risks, particularly in arid and Mediterranean areas, while demonstrating advancements in drought modeling purposes, data collection, and mitigation strategies. Nonetheless, substantial shortcomings persist. While Western regions like Europe and North America have been thoroughly examined, the mechanisms contributing to drought susceptibility in Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and other climate-vulnerable areas remain insufficiently investigated, despite their distinct monsoonal systems and socio-agrarian dependencies. Secondly, model validation frequently exhibits deficiencies in accurately representing localized hydroclimatic conditions. This study highlights that the mechanisms underlying drought dynamics in monsoonal systems like Southeast Asia remain underexplored. For instance, Indonesia, a region highly vulnerable to El Niño-induced droughts, contributed only 366 documents, starkly contrasting with the United States (7,565) or China (5,552). This disparity overlooks unique hydroclimatic vulnerabilities and socio-agrarian dependencies in marginalized regions, as noted in the limitations section, which highlights biases toward English-language publications and institutional overrepresentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Yordanov et al., 2020</xref>). Drought incidence, intensity, and duration are all greatly influenced by climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions and human activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). To successfully address food insecurity, water shortage, and other associated challenges, mitigation and adaptation measures based on understanding the interactions between these two phenomena are necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kotlarz &amp;amp; Bejger, 2024</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Nam et al. (2015)</xref> evaluated the impacts of climate change on the patterns and intensity of drought in various places, aiming to estimate and model potential drought conditions in the face of different climate change scenarios, determine the fundamental processes and feedback loops linking drought and climate change, and evaluate the ecological and social effects of droughts brought on by climate change. In addition, tools for drought monitoring and early warning were developed, alongside evaluations of the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies. Through bibliometric analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Islam et al. (2023)</xref> concluded that growing patterns of drought frequency and severity may be linked to climate change, mostly in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Zhou et al. (2011)</xref> found that variations in temperature and precipitation patterns cause droughts to worsen and last longer. In addition, hotspots or areas where droughts caused by climate change are particularly likely to occur were identified. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Xu et al. (2023)</xref> demonstrated that human activities—such as inappropriate water management, land-use changes, and climate change—exacerbate drought conditions. Models and drought indexes were created and verified to improve tracking and forecasting and provide insights into how droughts affect several industries, including water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems. A bibliometric analysis approach can reveal these findings by looking at citation networks, locating highly cited and influential papers, assessing keyword co-occurrences and trends, and mapping the collaborative networks amongst academics and institutions working on this subject. This study emphasizes the urgency and significance of addressing the impact of climate change on drought by synthesizing the noteworthy findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Schwab et al., 2023</xref>). This highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, policy interventions, and the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p><p>Climate change starkly highlights the occurrence of previously unheard-of high temperatures, protracted and intense heatwaves, and other extreme meteorological phenomena throughout Europe and the world, further highlighting the relevance and urgency of research in the real world. The study’s primary goal is to evaluate the annual climatic conditions during the previous years and compare them to established norms to make meaningful conclusions regarding the trajectory of climate change indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdoussalami et al., 2023</xref>) More critical points have been accepted for the definitions of drought, making research more sufficient. In addition, one of the study’s primary goals is to develop reliable drought indices that can examine drought characteristics in a changing climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Meshram &amp;amp; Kadu, 2023</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Brown et al. (2015)</xref> highlighted how long-term climate change directly causes extreme weather events, including drought, to become more frequent and intense. Furthermore, concerningly, due to its impacts on drought in Europe, climate change was found to increase more than double that of the global average over the previous ten decades, with Europe showing the highest growth rate of climate change of any other continent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Osman (2023)</xref> proficiently demonstrated the research’s significance by stressing the severe effects of climate change on extreme weather events and the hazards to human health that accompany them. After outlining the research goals and evaluating weather conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Bharambe et al. (2023)</xref> compared them to standards and created reliable drought indicators. In addition, previous research was used to support the assertions about the effects of climate change and the urgent need for more excellent studies in this vital field.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kone et al. (2024)</xref> predicted that drought episodes can become increasingly frequent, prolonged, and severe due to climate change, especially in dry and semi-arid agroecosystems like northern Africa and the Mediterranean and the world in general. However, this presents significant challenges for agricultural sustainability and food security in these vulnerable regions. Drought can negatively impact agricultural productivity and, in turn, food security. Therefore, this is a severe problem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Lima et al. (2023)</xref> aimed to determine whether applying a biochar-compost mixture as a soil supplement can help rice plants grown in low-fertility sandy soil, which is a soil characteristic of recently reclaimed land in Asia, Europe, America, and Africa, become more drought-tolerant. The study research postulates that by holding more soil moisture, the amendment could enhance drought stress tolerance and lessen the adverse impacts of drought. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Derdour et al. (2023)</xref> demonstrated that biochar can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon while improving crop yield, fertility, and soil quality.</p><p>It has been observed that using biochar as a management strategy can help lessen the adverse effects of drought stress on crop output. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Hindiyeh et al. (2023)</xref> pointed out that the relationship between biochar and the agroecosystem must be carefully considered to get the best outcomes. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Rossi &amp;amp; Peres (2023)</xref> is important because agricultural productivity in recently reclaimed low-fertility sandy soils in the world increases, where the salinity of the soil and a lack of fresh water are significant barriers to food security. Because of its strategic significance and suitability as a model plant for monocots, rice was selected as the model crop. By applying a biochar-compost mixture as a soil supplement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Tofu et al. (2023)</xref> aimed to improve drought tolerance in rice, a critical crop in the world, and address the urgent problem of drought brought on by climate change. Building on earlier studies on the advantages of climate change, the need for optimization and assessment was addressed according to the setting. Additionally, bibliometric research has demonstrated that improving the ability to monitor and forecast droughts requires developing complex modeling techniques and remote sensing technology. These techniques have helped academics better understand drought’s temporal and spatial patterns and estimate future conditions under various climate change scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Faluyi &amp;amp; Irmak, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The bibliometric analysis highlights the vital need for collaborative efforts to address this grave global issue and emphasizes the significance of studying drought and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Dione et al., 2023</xref>). The project has yielded significant findings, including the irrefutable link between drought patterns and climate change, regional vulnerabilities, the multidisciplinary nature of the study, and the use of advanced modeling and monitoring techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">King et al., 2021</xref>). This analysis summarizes available data and provides a solid foundation for the subsequent studies and informed decision-making to mitigate the effects of drought brought on by climate change, which allows for the proactive mitigation of related risks and effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Meixner et al., 2016</xref>). The principal objective of this work is to compile the body of information on the topic using the bibliometric analytic approach. This method enables the identification of notable authors, current research developments, and prestigious publications in the field by evaluating published studies using quantitative and qualitative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Eslamian &amp;amp; Eslamian, 2017</xref>). In doing so, it offers a thorough grasp of current levels of knowledge and draws attention to any potential gaps or areas that require more research. Essential results from past research highlight the worrisome effects of climate change on global drought patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Treidel et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.1. Limitations using the bibliometric analysis method</title>
          
          <p>One limitation is the potential bias in publication and citation patterns, as some research areas or regions may receive disproportionate attention, leading to an overrepresentation in the literature. At the same time, the tendency to cite well-known or highly influential studies can create citation biases, potentially overlooking important but lesser-cited works. Another limitation lies in the lack of access to unpublished or non-English literature, as bibliometric analyses primarily focus on published, peer-reviewed literature, often favoring English-language publications, which may overlook valuable research findings from unpublished sources or publications in other languages, potentially introducing language and publication biases. Additionally, bibliometric analysis quantitatively measures research outputs and trends. Still, it may need to fully capture the qualitative aspects of the research, such as the depth of theoretical frameworks, methodological rigor, or the nuances of research findings, potentially oversimplifying complex research areas.</p><p>Moreover, the temporal scope of the databases or indexing services utilized may restrict the accessibility and availability of bibliographic data; as a result, the analysis might not include the most current articles or promptly identify developing research trends. Furthermore, the proper procurement and incorporation of research from many academic fields may provide difficulties for bibliometric analysis, which could result in an inadequate representation of the total research environment. Naturally, interdisciplinary topics like drought, and global warming span the fields of climatology, hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and social sciences.  Lastly, although bibliometric analysis focuses on the quantitative evaluation of research outputs, the larger context in which the research is done may need to be fully considered. Policy concerns, funding availability, research aims, societal demands, and inquiry agendas are a few examples of this context that might affect the focus and direction of the research study.</p>

      <title>2. Materials and methods</title>
      <p>Climate change is the most significant and crucial worldwide concern, and it profoundly impacts human society, natural systems, and the broader environment. To investigate the scholarly landscape related to this issue, a systematic bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Scopus database. The Scopus database has its own strengths and coverage attributes and was chosen as the primary resource due to its rigorous peer-review standards, comprehensive coverage of high-impact journals, and dependable indexing techniques, ensuring the metadata quality required for bibliometric research. Scopus improved this option by providing comprehensive coverage of foreign journals, particularly from emerging economies and non-English speaking countries, while maintaining stringent quality control measures to eliminate predatory publications. The Scopus database was deliberately incorporated to encompass supplementary academic sources, including conference proceedings, theses, and institutional reports that may be neglected by conventional indexing services, while concurrently omitting grey literature such as unpublished reports, government documents, and non-peer-reviewed materials to uphold academic integrity. The keyword study topic was rigorously examined across databases to enhance retrieval while ensuring uniformity in conceptual coverage. The terms “climate change impacts on drought” were utilized for search in the database, with field limits applied to the title, abstract, and keyword sections to ensure precision in relevance. Scopus necessitated a revised methodology utilizing simplified keyword combinations because of its less advanced search interface, applying the phrase “climate change impacts on drought” with temporal limitations, and removing patents, citations, and legal papers to concentrate on scholarly publications. This differentiated method mitigated selection bias by optimizing the unique indexing attributes of each database while preserving conceptual uniformity across all search algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Deulkar et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The subsequent stage involved a systematic, multi-phase data cleaning process. This began with the automatic identification and removal of duplicate records, using document identifiers, title similarity algorithms, and author-journal cross-referencing methods. The dataset was further refined through bibliometric profiling, which included the classification of documents by year of publication, citation frequency, subject area, country of origin, and leading contributors to research on climate change and its impacts on drought. Precise Digital Object Identifier (DOI) matching was employed across all Scopus databases for the initial removal of duplicates. Subsequently, fuzzy matching algorithms were applied to detect near-duplicates exhibiting 95% title similarity and identify the study period of 2013-2023 from the Scopus database, generating a total number of 13,058 documents. This methodology rectified various bibliographic inconsistencies in the standardization process, including variations in author names (managing diverse abbreviation patterns, inclusion/exclusion of middle initials, and cultural naming conventions), journal name standardization (transforming abbreviated titles to full forms and addressing historical name changes), and classification of publication types by separating the duplicate publications and differentiating all types of non-English documents, such as articles (9,676), book chapters (1,277), conference papers (743), books (120), reviews (1,012), conference reviews (143), data papers (15), short surveys (15), and notes (72). Language filtering was an essential aspect of the cleaning protocol, wherein non-English publications were systematically identified through various verification methods, including language field analysis, title translation detection, and abstract language identification utilizing automated language detection algorithms. Non-English publications were recorded for the analysis of geographic and linguistic diversity but were omitted from the primary bibliometric analysis to maintain consistency in citation pattern examination and content categorization, due to the inherent bias favoring English-language citations in international academic databases. Conference abstracts were subjected to stringent quality evaluation according to established criteria, which included a minimum length of 150 words, a description of methodology, the inclusion of quantitative results, and verification of conference ranking through recognized academic conference rating systems. Abstracts failing to meet these standards were systematically excluded to uphold analytical integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Yang, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The final stage of the research methodology involved comprehensive data analysis. Publication trend data were first extracted and imported from CSV files into VOSviewer for bibliometric interpretation and visualization. A structured set of inclusion criteria was then applied to establish a rigorous analytical framework, ensuring that only publications specifically addressing the intersection of climate change and drought impacts—through empirical studies, theoretical models, or comprehensive review methodologies—were retained for analysis. Publications were included if they demonstrated clear research objectives regarding climate change-drought relationships, employed systematic methodologies (quantitative modeling, statistical analysis, experimental design, or systematic review protocols), offered original findings or novel theoretical contributions, and were published in peer-reviewed journals from 2013 to 2023 to ensure temporal consistency and reflect the latest decade of research advancements. Supplementary inclusion criteria required that publications demonstrate adequate methodological transparency, offer clear definitions of drought parameters (including meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, or socioeconomic types), and specify geographical or temporal scope to enable meaningful comparative analysis across various climate regions and time periods. The exclusion criteria were methodical, eliminating publications that did not adhere to academic rigor, including non-peer-reviewed materials (working papers, institutional reports, policy briefs, and popular science articles), duplicate publications identified through cross-database comparison, publications devoid of clear methodological frameworks or research questions, and those offering solely anecdotal or opinion-based content without empirical substantiation. Technical exclusions encompass publications deficient in comprehensive bibliographic metadata (missing author information, publication dates, or journal identifiers), articles shorter than four pages (excluding substantial research content), and publications that analyzed climate change or drought independently without exploring their interconnected dynamics. Editorial materials, book reviews, conference announcements, and correspondence were systematically excluded to focus on substantial research contributions, ensuring that the final dataset comprised a cohesive collection of high-quality academic publications suitable for comprehensive bibliometric analysis, which could reliably clarify research trends, knowledge gaps, and emerging themes in climate change-drought impact research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). This research sheds light on essential authors, seminal works, new directions in the field, and areas of potential knowledge that need to be explored. Ultimately, this will help shape future investigations and policy choices concerning methods for mitigating drought and adapting to a rapidly changing climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Orimoloye et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

The number of documents published rose from 1,394 in 2013 to 4,597 in 2023, a significant growth of more than 230% in just ten years. This figure offers a mathematical foundation for additional bibliometric analysis, such as determining the essential contributors to this field of study, i.e., authors, organizations, or nations. It can also make it easier to analyze co-authorship patterns, citation networks, and primary research groups or clusters focusing on drought and climate change issues. This bibliometric analysis provides a crucial starting point for researchers working in this area by providing information on the state of the field, directing future studies, and easing the synthesis of current research to deepen the understanding of the crucial connection between drought and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Rockström et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A compelling visualization of the research trends and patterns in the last ten years on climate change and its effects on drought can be seen in the supplied bibliometric analysis, which highlights this research subject’s growing importance and urgency by demonstrating the notable increase in the yearly number of documents published on this issue. The steady growing trend indicates the severe effects of climate change on global drought patterns and the increased focus and efforts made to comprehend and lessen these effects. Furthermore, this analysis is valuable because it helps researchers spot gaps, emerging themes, or areas that need more inquiry within the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Lorenzo-Lacruz et al., 2010</xref>). By analyzing publishing trends, scientists can develop novel research goals and hypotheses, guaranteeing that their work stays current and tackles the most urgent problems associated with drought and climate change occurrences. Crucially, the vast number of papers released throughout time constitutes a treasure trove of information and conclusions from numerous academics and organizations across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). Using an exhaustive examination and amalgamation of extant literature, scholars can expand upon prior research, discern trends, and derive significant deductions that bolster an enhanced comprehension of the intricate interplay between drought and climate change. Additionally, the bibliometric analysis makes it easier to explore the research landscape further. It helps identify influential authors, organizations, or nations significantly contributing to this field. The research community can collaborate and exchange knowledge by using it to analyze co-authorship patterns and citation networks and identify essential research groups or clusters focusing on drought and climate change elements. This bibliometric analysis provides researchers in this field with an invaluable foundation, providing insights into the state of the field, directing future studies and easing the synthesis of current knowledge to advance the collective understanding of the crucial relationship between drought and climate change, ultimately influencing strategies and policies to mitigate and adapt to these urgent global challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Dejene et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The region-specific priorities outlined above demonstrate a comprehensive approach to drought resilience. These include leveraging localized assessments for Southeast Asian smallholders through vulnerability mapping and climate-socioeconomic integration. In Sub-Saharan Africa’s arid regions, irrigation systems have been optimized using solar-powered drip technology, while in Mediterranean and North African low-fertility zones, soil moisture retention strategies have been scaled using biochar-compost amendments. Simultaneously, efforts have been made to strengthen global research equity by fostering collaborative networks that address geographic biases. This involves enhancing model validation through region-specific drought indices and localized data integration. Policy frameworks have been implemented to mainstream bibliometric findings into national adaptation plans, and satellite-based early warning systems have been deployed in data-scarce regions. Moreover, traditional knowledge from Indigenous communities has been integrated with modern agroecological practices, aligning all interventions with international frameworks such as the compound risk assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for zero hunger and climate action, and the proposed Global Drought Resilience Charter. Together, these efforts aim to transform research insights into actionable and equitable climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>Over the past ten years, the study’s thorough bibliometric analysis has yielded essential insights into the critical research on climate change and its increasing impacts on global drought patterns. This research effectively illustrates the growing urgency and significance that the international scientific community is attributing to this field of study, as seen by the constantly rising number of publications each year. With significant contributions from top research nations, including the United States, China, Germany, and the United Kingdom, the network visualization demonstrates the wide-ranging international cooperation and substantial investments to address this urgent environmental issue. The examination pinpoints significant establishments, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences and esteemed universities from different nations, propelling multidisciplinary studies to progress understanding in this field. By highlighting well-known writers and their academic works, the study encourages possible partnerships and the sharing of knowledge among specialists around the globe. Most importantly, the analysis of keyword occurrences demonstrates the complex nature of the research goals and essential conclusions. High-frequency terms such as “drought”, “ecosystem”, “precipitation”, “climate change”, and “water supply” have brought attention to the complex interactions between socioeconomic effects, environmental systems, water resources, and climatic elements investigated. These results highlight the critical need for coordinated strategies, creative modeling methods, and state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies to track, predict, and lessen the harmful consequences of drought made worse by climate change. This bibliometric analysis has produced a thorough quantitative evaluation of the literature, highlighting significant works, new trends, partnerships, and possible knowledge gaps. It provides a solid foundation to direct future research goals, advise policy-making, and build efficient adaptation and mitigation methods by combining noteworthy findings from earlier studies. Ultimately, this vast corpus of work demonstrates the scientific community’s resolute dedication to tackling one of the most urgent environmental issues for halting climate change’s severe and pervasive effects on global drought patterns.</p>
