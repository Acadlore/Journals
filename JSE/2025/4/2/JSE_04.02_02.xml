      <abstract><p>This paper critically examines the possibilities of combining pergolas and <italic>V. Coignetiae </italic>as energy-efficient, bioclimatic, green architecture and passive solar systems in the single-family building located in a moderate continental climate zone, i.e. Kragujevac (Serbia). More precisely, the impact of facade wall (without transparent elements) orientation with and without the mentioned measures (elements) on the electricity consumption for space cooling from 1 April to 31 October is investigated. The initial building model was developed using Google SketchUp software and following the Serbian Rulebook on Energy Efficiency for New Buildings. The thermo-technical systems and occupancy were simulated with EnergyPlus software. Based on the simulations conducted and the results obtained, the following main conclusions can be drawn: (1) Moderate continental climate is suitable for implementing the proposed concept; (2) Electricity consumption for space cooling, in the single-family building without energy-efficient, bioclimatic, green architecture and passive solar systems, is the highest when the facade wall (without transparent elements) is oriented to the North (827.25 kWh); and (3) Pergolas and adopted deciduous climber, placed in front of the facade wall (without transparent elements), reduce the electricity consumption for space cooling the most in the case of an Eastern orientation (363.7 kWh).</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The term bioclimatic design is closely related to green architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], energy efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] and sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] terms. All these terms share a common basis, because they represent concepts, strategies, methods, etc., introduced in the period when the professional and scientific public entered the struggle against climate change. This struggle is very intense today. A special place of struggle is the moderately continental climate region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], where the clear boundaries between the 4 seasons are gradually eroding, and thus, the optimal conditions for life.</p><p>Bioclimatic design can be defined as an architectural direction that deals with the implementation of natural elements in buildings of different purposes, with the aim of better connecting people with the environment. These effects, which have a positive effect on the mental and physical health of people, cannot be achieved without the use of natural materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] (wood, stone, etc.) and natural location parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] (sun, wind, water resources, vegetation, soil characteristics and terrain configuration). These effects cannot be achieved without the use of renewable energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], primarily solar energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], through passive solar systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>Passive solar systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], unlike active solar systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], are not primarily intended for direct and independent use of the solar energy, but are elements created exclusively from building materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], and which by their design (mechanical, optical, geometric and thermal characteristics) enable the use of solar energy, without the use of additional mechanical elements and devices. Passive solar systems are used for indirect space heating or cooling in buildings. This reduces the final and primary energy consumption from active heating and cooling systems, so temperature comfort is easily achieved and maintained. The group of heating passive solar systems includes the following elements: Trombe walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], selective coated facade walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], greenhouses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], thermal storage walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], etc. On the other hand, the group of cooling passive solar systems includes elements such as: overhangs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], pergolas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], blinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], etc.</p><p>Although attention has been paid to passive solar systems, there are still underexplored and insufficiently explored areas of their application. In this paper, the research subject is the residential building located in Kragujevac, Central Serbia. Given that the modern designed building is located in a region with a moderate continental climate affected by climate change (the number of heat waves has been increasing in recent years according to data from the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]), this paper uses recent weather files (from 2009 to 2023) and numerical simulations (in Google SketchUp and EnergyPlus software) to investigate the possibilities of using bioclimatic design (based on pergolas and concrete deciduous climber, i.e.<italic> V. Coignetiae</italic>) in energy purposes during the seven-month extended summer season period (from 1 April to 31 October), taking into account the orientation of the building.</p><p>The authors, through this paper, aim to support the professional and scientific public in the fight against climate change by promoting relatively simple solutions to reduce final energy consumption, specifically, space cooling.</p>

            <title>2.2. Pergolas and deciduous climber</title>
          
          <p>External pergolas in front of the non-transparent facade wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>a) were created in Google SketchUp software using the New EnergyPlus Shading Group tool from the Legacy OpenStudio palette. The same procedure was used in the case of creating deciduous climber, i.e. <italic>V. Coignetiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>b).</p><p>Wooden boards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>a), with a cross-section of 40 × 40 mm and a total length of 79 m, form a vertical frame, i.e. external pergolas, with dimensions of 8 × 5.2 m at a distance of 1 m from the non-transparent facade wall. The frame is attached to the non-transparent facade wall on its edges with supports (13 of them in total). The supports ensure that the selected deciduous climber grows unhindered, without mechanically endangering the non-transparent facade wall in front of which it is placed.</p><p>The deciduous climber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>b) is approximated by rectangles (1.94 × 1.25 m) that fill the space between the wooden boards. Its main purpose is to reduce the yield of total solar irradiance <italic>I<sub>tot</sub></italic> [W·m<sup>-2</sup>], primarily direct solar irradiance <italic>I<sub>dir</sub></italic> [W·m<sup>-2</sup>], on the external side of the non-transparent facade wall, which is described as the so-called bioclimatic solar shading <italic>BSC</italic> [-] parameter. Its values ​​range between 0 and 1. The closer the <italic>BSC</italic> value is to 1, the weaker the effectiveness of stopping solar radiation. On the other side, if the <italic>BSC</italic> value approaches 0, the shading is stronger and the final energy consumption for space cooling <italic>E<sub>fin,cool</sub></italic> [kWh] is lower. An additional benefit of using a deciduous climber is the mechanical protection it provides to the thermal envelope, in this case, the non-transparent facade wall, from mechanical damage that may occur, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.</p>

            <title>2.4. Analyzed cases</title>
          
          <p>The focus of this paper is the non-transparent facade wall, that is, the facade wall without external windows and doors, which is not given enough attention in the literature. This building element is common to the living room (first floor), bedroom 1 (second floor) and bedroom 2 (second floor), and as such is interesting for the implementation of specific bioclimatic energy-efficient strategies and measures. Bioclimatic design largely relies on the passive use of renewable energy sources, primarily solar energy, in order to reduce the final energy consumption for space heating and cooling in residential buildings.</p><p>The following table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>) shows all analyzed cases of monitoring energy flows (final energy consumption for space cooling during the extended summer season from 1 April to 31 October) in a specific residential building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>) in accordance with the orientation of the non-transparent facade (first variable) and the equipment with bioclimatic systems (second variable).</p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, it can be concluded that a total of 8 simulation scenarios were realized, because the non-transparent facade wall (with and without bioclimatic elements) of the residential building is oriented towards different sides of the world: North, East, South, West.</p>

      <p>The following diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>) show the monthly consumption of <italic>E<sub>fin,cool</sub></italic> depending on the analyzed scenario (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>): North orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>a), East orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>b), South orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>c), West orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>d).</p><p>In the case of the orientation of the non-transparent facade wall towards North (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>a), the cooling needs (without I with bioclimatic design) are the highest during the following months: July (273.87 kWh and 258.49 kWh), August (252.32 kWh and 241.59 kWh), June (192.26 kWh and 177.71 kWh). During this time period, the intensities of <italic>H<sub>dir</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>dir</sub></italic> are the highest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>). The lower values ​​achieved when using bioclimatic design are a consequence of the low <italic>BSC</italic> indicator values (approaching 0). Smaller needs for cooling occur during September (81.57 kWh and 76.3 kWh), which is in accordance with meteorological conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>). Meteorological conditions are the reason why <italic>E<sub>fin,cool </sub></italic>= 0 kWh during April and October.</p><p>A similar distribution of final energy consumption for space cooling is also in the case of South orientation ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>c). The consumption is highest in July (265.87 kWh and 247.64 kWh), then in August (243.33 kWh and 222.63 kWh), while in third place is June (185.47 kWh and 169.45 kWh). April and October are still months when there is no need to hire air-condition units, whether bioclimatic and passive solar measures are used or not.</p><p>When the non-transparent facade wall is oriented to the East, the entrance door is oriented to the South. The area of ​​all transparent elements on the Southern facade (together with the entrance door) is 6.82 m<sup>2</sup>, and on the Northern facade it is 6.08 m<sup>2</sup>, while the entrance door and toilet window are in the shadow of the horizontal overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). In this case, <italic>E<sub>fin,cool</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>b) is significantly higher during August (157.99 kWh) compared to July (155.35 kWh) when the partial shading elements are not used. This difference is somewhat larger in the case of using elements for partial shading, if it is lower in comparison with the previously mentioned values: 134.4 kWh (August), 127.88 kWh (July). Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>b, it can also be concluded that the cooling season can be additionally shortened by another month, in this case for May.</p><p>Just as the energy consumption is similar in the case of the North (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>a) and South (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>c) orientation, so the energy consumption in the case of the West (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>d) orientation is similar (but somewhat less favorable) to the consumption in the case of the East (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>b) orientation: June (80.83 kWh and 57.28 kWh), July (159.21 kWh and 128.71 kWh), August (169.98 kWh and 144.04 kWh), September (65.91 kWh and 51.88 kWh). During October, this consumption amounts to 11.51 kWh and 6.97 kWh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>d), which can be ignored, as well as in the case of East orientation of the non-transparent facade wall (6.69 kWh and 3.99 kWh, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>b).</p>

      <p>At the end, the diagram from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows the percentage savings in final energy consumption for space cooling in the residential building with bioclimatic elements compared to the residential building without bioclimatic elements, of course depending on its orientation. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>, it can be clearly seen that, in percentage terms, the savings are lower in the height of the cooling season, but at the same time, in absolute numerical values, the savings are the highest precisely in that time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>). The highest percentage savings by month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>) are achieved in the case of Western (May, June, July, August) and Eastern orientation (September). An exception can be considered October, which is inclined to the South orientation.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper numerically investigated the impact of bioclimatic design on the space cooling in the residential building located in Kragujevac (Serbia). A geometric model of the residential building was created in Google SketchUp software following the Serbian Rulebook for Energy Efficiency in Buildings. All thermo-technical systems are simulated, also following the mentioned Rulebook, in EnergyPlus software. Energy benefits from the use of bioclimatic design (based on pergolas and and <italic>V. Coignetiae</italic>—as an adopted type of deciduous climber) during the expanded summer season (from 1 April to 30 October) are investigated depending on the orientation of the non-transparent facade wall of the residential building in a moderate continental climate region, i.e. a region that is particularly affected by climate change.</p><p>Simulation results show that the final energy consumption for space cooling in the residential building is between 363.7 kWh and 774.59 kWh. In accordance with the geometry of the building, the room layouts, the window-wall ratio, the position of the horizontal intersection, as well as the occupancy schedules of the people and electric equipment, cooling energy consumption is the lowest if it is non-transparent oriented due to the East, while it is the highest in the case of the North orientation. This means that with a smart approach, even in the design phase, taking into account location parameters, the consumption of final energy for space cooling can be significantly reduced.</p><p>Residential and non-residential building sectors are highly sensitive links in the chain of energy transformations and balances. Since bioclimatic design aligns with basic natural principles by connecting humans with the environment, future research will focus on further developing the proposed engineering and architectural solutions, as well as exploring similar approaches, to move the sector closer to sustainable development.</p>
