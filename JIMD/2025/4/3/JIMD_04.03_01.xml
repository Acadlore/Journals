      <abstract><p>An artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agricultural advisory system, termed NDEMRI (Nurturing Digital Extension via Mobile and Responsive Intelligence), has been developed to provide evidence-based farming guidance to rural communities across sub-Saharan Africa through short message service (SMS). Designed for compatibility with basic GSM-enabled mobile phones and independent of internet access for end-users, the system integrates large language models (LLMs) via the ChatGPT API to generate contextually relevant, linguistically localized responses to a wide array of agricultural queries. A quasi-experimental evaluation was conducted in the northern regions of Cameroon over a four-month period, employing a matched control group methodology involving 831 treatment farmers and 400 controls. Statistically significant improvements were observed among participants using NDEMRI, with mean crop yields increasing by 16.6% and agricultural incomes rising by 23%, relative to the control group. Adoption of improved agronomic practices was notably higher among users of the system. A total of 2,487 unique messages were exchanged, covering themes such as pest management, planting schedules, soil health, and post-harvest storage, with 78% of users reporting that system responses were context-sensitive and adapted to local climatic and cultural conditions. The technical architecture is characterized by modular natural language understanding pipelines, embedded guardrails to minimize model hallucinations, and a reproducible framework for contextualization based on regional agricultural datasets. A detailed economic analysis demonstrated the financial sustainability of the intervention, with favorable cost-benefit ratios and scalability potential. These findings offer robust empirical evidence that the integration of accessible communication technologies with state-of-the-art AI can overcome infrastructural limitations, enhance decision-making in low-resource farming environments, and serve as a viable model for transforming agricultural extension services across the African continent.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Agriculture remains the backbone of many African economies, employing over 60% of the continent’s active workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Yet, rural farmers face significant challenges, including limited access to up-to-date agricultural information, modern techniques, and expert knowledge. Traditional agricultural extension services, while essential, are often insufficient due to budgetary constraints, a limited number of extension agents, and logistical difficulties in reaching remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Recent advances in AI particularly in LLMs offer new opportunities to bridge this information gap. However, the adoption of these advanced technologies in rural areas is hindered by several factors: limited internet access, low smartphone penetration, high mobile data costs, and language barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. These constraints call for the development of technology solutions that are adapted to local realities. This paper introduces NDEMRI, an agricultural support system that harnesses the power of LLMs while adapting to the technological context of rural Africa. NDEMRI uses SMS as its primary user interface, enabling farmers to access expert farming advice through basic mobile phones, without the need for internet connectivity. The system acts as a bridge between cutting-edge AI technologies and existing communication infrastructure in rural areas. Our study aims to address the following research questions: How can LLMs be adapted to deliver relevant agricultural advice via SMS in the African context? What are the technical and practical challenges of implementing such a system in resource-constrained environments? And what is the potential impact of an AI-based agricultural support service on farming practices and farmers’ livelihoods?</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Here, we synthesize research on mobile and AI solutions for agriculture, evaluating their socio-technical impacts across different contexts.</p>
      
        <sec>
          
            <title>2.1. Mobile technologies for agricultural development</title>
          
          <p>The use of mobile technologies to support agricultural development has been the focus of numerous studies over the past decade. Aker and Mbiti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] documented the transformative impact of mobile phones on African economies, identifying five key mechanisms through which they promote economic development, particularly within the agricultural sector. Empirical research by Aker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] in Niger showed that the introduction of mobile phones reduced price disparities between agricultural markets by 10-16%, with more significant effects observed in remote areas. This improved market efficiency and lowered search costs for farmers.</p><p>These advances paved the way for innovative services such as mFarm in Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], Esoko in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], and WeFarm in East Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], demonstrating that SMS-based tools can effectively connect farmers to markets and agricultural information. Studies by Cole and Fernando [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] in India confirmed that mobile-delivered agricultural advice can significantly improve farming practices and crop yields.</p><p>However, as Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] highlight in their comprehensive review of the ICT revolution in agricultural extension, these technologies continue to face persistent challenges, particularly digital, linguistic, and gender divides. Moreover, the dissemination of agricultural knowledge remains complex. Alenea and Manyong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], in their study on the diffusion of agricultural technologies in Nigeria, observed considerable differences in outcomes among adopters. They emphasized the importance of the quality of information delivered and the role of social networks in shaping adoption processes.</p>

            <title>2.2. Ai in agriculture</title>
          
          <p>The integration of AI into agriculture is an expanding area of research. Applications range from image processing for plant disease detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] to predictive analytics for crop planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. However, Becerra-Encinales et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], in their systematic review, identify a set of multidimensional barriers to the adoption of agricultural technologies in developing countries, categorized into sociocultural, economic, institutional, and techno-structural obstacles. Most AI-driven applications require smartphones, reliable internet connectivity, or specialized equipment conditions that remain scarce in many rural areas across Africa.</p><p>LLMs represent a significant evolution in this context. Biswas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] and Gaddikeri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] have explored the potential uses of ChatGPT in agriculture, highlighting promising areas such as plant disease diagnosis support, crop management optimization, and simplifying access to technical information for non-specialist farmers. Siche and Siche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], through a bibliometric analysis, documented the rapid emergence of LLM applications in agriculture and livestock, concluding that these technologies have the potential to transform precision farming and agricultural advisory services.</p><p>More targeted applications are also emerging. Potamitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] examined how ChatGPT can be integrated into precision agriculture systems, analyzing how these models can interpret and make sense of complex data from sensors, drones, and satellites. Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] demonstrated ChatGPT’s superiority in multilingual classification of agricultural texts, suggesting strong potential for developing multilingual agricultural advisory services, especially in low-resource languages. In a more applied perspective, Alobid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] analyzed the benefits of ChatGPT in the European agricultural sector, identifying use cases such as crop decision optimization and early disease forecasting.</p>

            <title>2.3. Gaps in existing research</title>
          
          <p>Despite advancements in mobile technologies and AI applications in agriculture, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of advanced LLM capabilities with basic communication technologies accessible to rural farmers. While the aforementioned studies analyze either the impacts of simple mobile technologies or the potential applications of LLMs in technologically advanced environments, few have explored the use of these models in low-resource settings or through basic communication channels such as SMS.</p><p>In particular, the adaptation of LLMs to local African agricultural knowledge remains largely unexplored, even though these models show strong potential for contextualizing and personalizing advice. Similarly, there is a lack of impact assessment regarding these hybrid technologies (combining SMS and advanced AI) on actual farming practices. Our study aims to address this gap by exploring how SMS, the most widespread mobile technology in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], can serve as an interface between farmers and sophisticated AI systems. This approach offers a promising pathway toward the democratization of agricultural knowledge in contexts with limited technological infrastructure.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>This section details the comprehensive methodology employed in developing and evaluating the NDEMRI system. The methodology encompasses seven key components: the technical design of the NDEMRI system (3.1), contextualization of the AI model to local agricultural conditions (3.2), deployment strategy and data collection processes (3.3), rigorous data analysis techniques (3.4), quasi-experimental design with control group implementation (3.5), and agronomic safety architecture with hallucination prevention mechanisms (3.6). Together, these methodological components provide a robust framework for developing, deploying, and evaluating an AI-powered agricultural support system that is both technically sophisticated and contextually appropriate for rural African communities.</p>

            <title>3.1. Design of the ndemri system</title>
          
          <p>NDEMRI was designed as an SMS messaging system that relays farmers' questions to a LLM (GPT-4 via the OpenAI API) and returns AI-generated responses to the users. The system consists of three main components:</p><p>1). Server Application: An Android application developed in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, which intercepts incoming SMS messages containing the keyword “ndemri," processes them, and sends the responses. This server runs on a dedicated Android smartphone located in an area with stable internet connectivity.</p><p>2). OpenAI API Interface: A service that formats requests for the GPT API with specific instructions to generate concise, SMS-friendly, and contextually relevant responses tailored to agricultural inquiries.</p><p>3). SMS Management Module: A component responsible for handling the reception and sending of SMS messages, optimized to operate reliably even under varying network conditions.</p><p>The system architecture is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

            <title>3.2. Contextualization of the ai model</title>
          
          <p>To adapt the GPT model to the specificities of the African agricultural context, we implemented a standardized five-step contextualization protocol to ensure consistency and replicability. It is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> below.</p>

              <p>At the heart of NDEMRI’s contextual intelligence lies a robust PostgreSQL-based relational database designed to deliver fine-grained, locally relevant insights. This dynamic knowledge backbone includes:</p><p>- 15,000+ market price entries, updated weekly to reflect real-time economic conditions across rural markets</p><p>- 240 crop varieties, each matched with tailored recommendations by agroecological zone for optimal adaptation</p><p>- 180 phytosanitary technical sheets, localized and simplified to align with available inputs and practices</p><p>- Dynamic crop calendars, refreshed every 10 days across 8 distinct climate zones, ensuring seasonal alignment and timely agronomic advice</p><p>This structured repository transforms generic responses into location-specific, actionable guidance—grounded in data, optimized for context.</p>

              <p>To bridge the gap between static advisory systems and location-aware intelligence, NDEMRI enriches each user query with a dynamic layer of geospatial and agroecological data. Based on the user's location, the system fetches key environmental, agronomic, and market variables before generating a response. This enhancement ensures hyper-localized recommendations, tailored not just to the crop—but to the farmer's micro-context.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p style="text-align: justify">Algorithm 1.

              <p>Learning is baked into the architecture. Every cycle strengthens the next:</p><p>- Error logs and user feedback are reviewed monthly;</p><p>- The knowledge base is refreshed quarterly based on expert and system-level updates;</p><p>- A/B testing evaluates variations in prompt phrasing and structure.</p><p>In short, the system gets smarter with every question. What began as a structured protocol becomes a self-reinforcing engine of precision advice.</p>

            <title>3.4. Data analysis</title>
          
          <p>Our analytical approach combined quantitative and qualitative methods to extract meaningful insights from SMS interactions and user interviews, enabling a comprehensive and contextualized understanding of NDEMRI system usage and impact.</p><p>(1) SMS Interaction Analysis</p><p>The 2,487 collected SMS messages underwent systematic multi-step analysis to identify recurring themes, primary concerns, and usage patterns. Text preprocessing initially involved cleaning raw messages by removing special characters, applying automatic spelling correction, and normalizing local agricultural terminology. A custom synonym dictionary specific to the Cameroonian agricultural context was developed to standardize references to crops, pests, and practices expressed in French, Fulfulde, and other local languages.</p><p>Lexicometric analysis using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization techniques identified discriminative terms across different question categories, facilitating extraction of topic-specific vocabularies (e.g., pest-related versus market-related language). Semi-supervised thematic classification was implemented through a classifier trained on a manually annotated subset of 2,000 messages by agricultural experts. The model, based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM), achieved 87% accuracy in categorizing messages into six main thematic classes, with manual validation on a random 10% sample to ensure reliability.</p><p>Temporal analysis of interactions in relation to the regional agricultural calendar identified correlations between farmer concerns and crop cycle phases. A 7-day sliding window technique tracked the evolution of dominant topics throughout the study period. Geospatial analysis, performed by linking phone numbers with GSM antenna coverage zones, approximated the geographical distribution of user queries and identified clusters of specific concerns tied to distinct agroecological zones.</p><p>(2) Qualitative Interview Analysis</p><p>Semi-structured interviews conducted with 30 selected users underwent in-depth qualitative analysis to understand user experience and perceived service impact. Interviews, conducted in French and Fulfulde, were fully transcribed and translated by native speakers into French when necessary, with translation reliability verified through back-translation on a sample of five interviews.</p><p>Iterative thematic coding following a grounded theory approach involved three coding phases. Initial open coding generated 54 descriptive codes, subsequently consolidated into 12 axial codes during the second phase. Finally, four core themes emerged through selective coding: perceived usefulness, service accessibility, trust in recommendations, and complementarity with traditional agricultural information sources.</p><p>Contrastive analysis gave special attention to atypical cases and divergent opinions to refine our understanding of user experience. The constant comparative method helped identify key moderating variables such as educational level, age, and prior access to other agricultural information sources. For each participant, we constructed cognitive maps illustrating perceived relationships between NDEMRI service use, changes in agricultural practices, and observed outcomes on their crops, enabling modeling of users' perceived causality chains.</p><p>(3) Data Triangulation</p><p>Analysis robustness was reinforced through methodical triangulation combining cross-validation, expert consultation, and user feedback. Themes identified through automated text analysis were cross-checked against qualitative interview results, while hypotheses emerging from interviews were quantitatively tested on the SMS message corpus. A panel of six experts—including two agronomists, two agricultural extension officers, one rural sociologist, and one natural language processing specialist—assessed the validity of preliminary interpretations and contributed to analytical framework refinement. A debriefing session with 12 interview participants validated main interpretations and integrated their perspectives into the final analysis.</p><p>This multi-method analytical approach enabled development of a nuanced and context-sensitive understanding of NDEMRI system use and impact, combining the precision of large-scale automated analysis with the depth of qualitative insights.</p>

            <title>3.5. Quasi-experimental design and control group</title>
          
          <p>To rigorously assess the effectiveness of the NDEMRI system, a quasi-experimental design was adopted, incorporating matched control groups to ensure comparability. The control group comprised 400 farmers across 10 villages located in agroecologically similar zones but without access to NDEMRI services. The matching process was based on key variables, including average farm size (2.3 ± 0.8 hectares in both groups), predominant crop types (maize, sorghum, and cotton), distance from agricultural extension centers (greater than 15 kilometers), access to financial services and markets, and historical rainfall patterns. Data collection was conducted through standardized surveys administered simultaneously across treatment and control groups at three critical points in the agricultural calendar: the baseline (May 2024, prior to NDEMRI deployment), the midline (July 2024, during the agricultural season), and the endline (October 2024, post-harvest).</p><p>The evaluation focused on a set of clearly defined impact variables. Primary outcome measures included agricultural yields (in kg/ha), assessed through direct measurement on test plots; the adoption of improved agricultural practices, quantified using a validated 12-item scale; and net agricultural income per season (measured in FCFA). Secondary outcomes encompassed the response time to phytosanitary issues (in days), diversification of sources used for agricultural information, and farmers’ confidence in their agricultural decision-making, measured on a 7-point Likert scale.</p>

            <title>3.6. Agronomic safety architecture and hallucination prevention</title>
          
          <p>The use of AI in agricultural advisory systems raises critical safety concerns, particularly when recommendations relate to pesticide application, animal health, food safety, or crop treatment. To address these risks, NDEMRI incorporates a robust, three-layered safety architecture designed to prevent AI hallucinations and ensure that all advice delivered to farmers is accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> describes this process.</p>

              <p>The first layer is a real-time risk detection system that automatically filters AI-generated responses before delivery.</p><p>- Keyword-Based Risk Detection: The system scans responses for high-risk terms across predefined categories (e.g., pesticides, medical treatments, food safety). It uses both lexical and semantic analysis to assign a cumulative risk score based on detected terms and their contextual relevance.</p><p>- Confidence and Risk Thresholding: Each response is also assessed based on its generation confidence. If the risk score exceeds predefined thresholds or if the confidence score is too low, the system redirects the response for expert review or rejects it outright.</p><p>- Quantitative Flagging: Any advice containing dosages, numeric values, or economic figures—such as pesticide concentrations, fertilizer application rates, or treatment intervals—is automatically flagged for manual verification to avoid harmful miscalculations.</p><p>This automated layer serves as the first gatekeeper, enabling the system to block potentially harmful content before it reaches users, while keeping the validation workflow efficient.</p>

              <p>To mitigate factual inaccuracies and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, NDEMRI integrates a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds AI responses in verified, domain-specific knowledge.</p><p>- Curated Knowledge Repository: The system relies on over 1,000 validated documents, including government extension materials, peer-reviewed agricultural research, and region-specific farming guidelines from organizations such as FAO, IRAD, MINADER and other sources.</p><p>- Semantic Consistency Checking: The generated response and the original query are converted into vector representations and compared with relevant knowledge base entries using semantic similarity scoring. An average consistency score is computed, weighted by the authority of the sources.</p><p>- Multi-Source Cross-Referencing: Key claims—especially those involving scientific facts, chemical treatments, or financial advice—are cross-verified across multiple trusted sources. Any inconsistency automatically triggers a flag for expert review.</p><p>This layer enhances factual grounding and ensures that AI outputs are not only linguistically fluent but also empirically sound.</p>

              <p>For high-risk, ambiguous, or complex queries, NDEMRI activates a real-time expert validation layer involving human specialists.</p><p>- Expert Pool: The validation network consists of a multidisciplinary team: 6 certified agronomists, 3 field extension officers, 2 soil scientists, 1 entomologist, and 1 agricultural economist, all with deep knowledge of sub-Saharan agricultural systems.</p><p>- Dynamic Routing and Prioritization: Incoming queries are classified by domain (e.g., crop disease, animal health, soil management) and routed to the appropriate expert. A priority queue system ensures that critical safety issues are addressed with minimal delay.</p><p>- Service Level Agreements (SLAs):</p><p>o Critical issues: Expert feedback within 1 hour</p><p>o High-risk queries: Within 4 hours</p><p>o Moderate-risk issues: Within 24 hours</p><p>o Routine validation: Within 72 hours</p><p>This final layer provides authoritative oversight, especially in edge cases where automated validation may be insufficient or potentially unsafe.</p>

              <p>A comparative analysis of crop yields between farmers exposed to the NDEMRI system and a matched control group revealed statistically significant improvements across all major crops (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>). Across all crops, NDEMRI users achieved a yield of 1,865 kg/ha compared to 1,599 kg/ha in the control group, representing a 16.6% increase. This difference of +266 kg/ha corresponds to a large average effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.37). These differences were not only statistically robust but also practically meaningful, with large effect sizes observed across crop types. The strongest impact was noted for maize, followed by sorghum, cotton, and groundnut.</p>

            <title>5.1. Effectiveness and limitations of llm-based agricultural sms services</title>
          
          <p>Our rigorous quasi-experimental evaluation demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively adapted to provide impactful agricultural advice through SMS technology. The system's capacity to understand and respond to diverse natural language agricultural queries in local contexts represents a substantial advancement over traditional SMS services that rely on preprogrammed responses or static USSD menus. The measured outcomes—including 16.6% yield improvements, 23% income increases, and widespread adoption of improved practices—provide compelling evidence of the system's agricultural impact.</p><p>However, our analysis also reveals several important limitations that must be acknowledged. The 160-character SMS constraint fundamentally restricts the depth and nuance of advice that can be provided. While we optimized the model to generate concise, actionable responses, this limitation inevitably reduces the richness of information compared to face-to-face consultation or longer-form written materials. Additionally, despite extensive contextualization efforts, the GPT model occasionally lacks highly specific knowledge about local crop varieties, traditional farming practices, or regional microclimatic conditions that are crucial for optimal agricultural decision-making.</p><p>Perhaps most critically, LLMs can produce inaccurate information or “hallucinations"—a limitation that carries particular significance in agricultural contexts where incorrect advice can result in crop losses, reduced yields, or economic hardship for vulnerable farming communities. Our multi-layered safety architecture mitigates these risks but cannot eliminate them entirely, highlighting the continued importance of expert oversight and validation mechanisms.</p>

            <title>5.2. Transforming agricultural extension through hybrid ai-human systems</title>
          
          <p>The NDEMRI system is designed not to replace traditional agricultural extension services but to complement and enhance them by providing an always-accessible, scalable communication channel. Our findings suggest that this hybrid approach—combining the deep contextual knowledge and trust relationships of human extension agents with the accessibility, consistency, and scalability of AI-based systems—represents a promising model for the future of agricultural extension in resource-constrained regions.</p><p>The comparative analysis with our control group validates this hybrid model's effectiveness. Users frequently reported using NDEMRI to supplement rather than replace interactions with extension agents, accessing immediate guidance during critical decision moments while maintaining relationships with local agricultural experts. This complementary dynamic suggests that AI-powered systems can fill temporal and geographic gaps in traditional extension coverage without undermining existing agricultural support structures.</p><p>The implications for agricultural extension policy are significant. First, there is a clear need to integrate technological solutions into national extension strategies, recognizing that digital tools can dramatically expand the reach and frequency of agricultural support services. Second, maintaining human supervision and validation mechanisms for AI-generated advice remains essential, both for quality assurance and for preserving farmer trust in extension services. Third, the demonstrated cost-effectiveness of the hybrid model—achieving superior outcomes at lower per-beneficiary costs than traditional extension approaches—suggests potential for substantial improvements in the efficiency and impact of public agricultural investment.</p>

          <p>Our comprehensive economic analysis reveals that the NDEMRI system achieves financial sustainability across multiple scenarios while delivering substantial value to users. The cost structure of \$0.043 per interaction, while seemingly modest, requires careful management and strategic partnerships to ensure long-term viability without compromising accessibility for smallholder farmers.</p><p>The sensitivity analysis across pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic scenarios demonstrates the system's resilience to market fluctuations in API pricing and telecommunications costs. Even under adverse conditions with doubled API costs and increased SMS fees, the system remains viable with achievable user adoption targets. The identification of multiple financing pathways—including freemium models with public subsidy, telecom partnerships, and institutional integration—provides flexibility to adapt to different policy environments and market conditions.</p><p>The user-level economic analysis reveals exceptionally strong value propositions, with farmers achieving a 90% return on investment per season through increased yields and reduced information-seeking costs. This dramatic improvement in farm-level economics suggests that even modest user fees could be sustainable while maintaining affordability for smallholder farmers.</p><p>Critical success factors for scaling include strategic partnerships with telecommunications operators to reduce SMS costs, integration with existing agricultural institutions to leverage established farmer relationships and trust, and continued investment in local knowledge base development to maintain response quality and relevance. The demonstrated replicability of the system architecture across different agroecological zones within Cameroon suggests strong potential for regional and continental scaling, provided that contextualization efforts are adapted to local agricultural systems and languages.</p><p>The convergence of technological maturity, demonstrated impact, economic viability, and institutional readiness positions NDEMRI as a scalable solution for democratizing agricultural knowledge across sub-Saharan Africa, with the potential to reach millions of smallholder farmers who currently lack access to timely, relevant agricultural advice.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusion and perspectives</title>
      <p>This study establishes the first rigorous empirical evidence of LLMs' effectiveness as tools for democratizing access to agricultural knowledge in rural African areas. By combining advanced technology (AI) with an accessible interface (SMS), NDEMRI represents an innovative approach to overcoming the connectivity and equipment barriers that often hinder the adoption of digital agricultural solutions. The quasi-experimental evaluation with a control group demonstrates substantial and statistically significant causal impact, revealing average yield improvements of 16.6%, agricultural income increases of 23%, and massive adoption of improved agricultural practices among NDEMRI users compared to the control group.</p><p>These results provide compelling evidence that farmers value this type of service and effectively integrate it into their information-seeking practices, concretely transforming their production methods. The dose-response analysis confirms a clear causal relationship between system usage intensity and benefits obtained, with intensive users (&gt;8 messages) achieving 24% yield improvements. This impact gradation validates the hypothesis that access to quality agricultural information constitutes a major limiting factor for African smallholder productivity.</p><p>Our research has addressed several significant technical challenges concerning advice accuracy, economic sustainability, and adaptation to specific local agricultural knowledge. The multi-layered safety architecture developed, including automated validation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and real-time expert supervision, maintained accuracy rates above 95% while preserving service accessibility. The integration of local agricultural databases—comprising 15,000 market price entries, 240 recommended crop varieties, and 180 adapted phytosanitary technical sheets—enabled effective contextualization of AI responses to the specific agroecological conditions of northern Cameroon. This reproducible contextualization approach constitutes a major methodological contribution for adapting LLMs to local agricultural contexts.</p><p>The findings have profound implications for agricultural extension and rural development policies. The hybrid AI-human model demonstrates a 3.8x superior return on investment compared to traditional extension approaches while extending the geographic and temporal reach of agricultural advisory services. Economic analysis reveals that the system can achieve financial viability with 8,500 active users in the realistic scenario, or only 4,200 in the optimistic scenario with strategic partnerships. These thresholds are achievable at a national scale for most African countries, suggesting substantial scaling potential.</p><p>Unlike previous preliminary studies, this research has overcome several critical methodological limitations. The inclusion of a rigorously matched control group, collection of objective agronomic metrics, and four-month observation period covering a complete agricultural cycle significantly strengthen the external validity of results. Robustness analysis through multiple sensitivity tests—outlier exclusion, confounding variable control, and validation across different agroecological zones—confirms the solidity of main conclusions. The consistency of measured effects across varied geographic and socio-economic contexts suggests strong transferability of results.</p><p>Future directions for NDEMRI development and study center on four priority axes. First, an extension to a 24-month randomized controlled trial will evaluate long-term impacts on food security and livelihoods. Second, integration of multimodal capabilities (SMS + images + audio) will enrich user interaction while preserving technological accessibility. Third, development of a federated AI system will enable inter-country learning while respecting national data sovereignty. Fourth, linguistic expansion beyond French and English to major local languages (Fulfulde, Hausa, Peul) will further democratize service access.</p><p>NDEMRI represents a decisive step toward more accessible, adaptive, and effective agricultural advisory systems. By continuing to refine the balance between advanced technologies and user-friendly interfaces, such systems could significantly contribute to transforming agricultural practices and improving food security in rural African regions. This research demonstrates that responsible AI innovation can catalyze sustainable agricultural development, paving the way for democratized advisory systems for Africa's 600 million smallholder farmers.</p><p>The intersection of technological accessibility, rigorous scientific validation, and demonstrated economic viability positions NDEMRI as a replicable model for digital transformation of sub-Saharan agriculture. The convergence of LLM technological maturity, GSM network ubiquity, and growing demand for accessible agricultural services creates a unique window of opportunity to deploy solutions like NDEMRI at a continental scale. This study provides the necessary empirical and methodological foundation to catalyze this transformation, contributing to the global objective of food security and sustainable rural development in Africa.</p>
