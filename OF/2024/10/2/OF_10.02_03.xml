      <abstract><p>This study investigates the sustainability practices employed by cattle farmers in Indonesia, applying the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) framework. As global concerns surrounding environmental degradation and resource depletion intensify, understanding sustainable agricultural practices, particularly in livestock farming, has become imperative. A qualitative approach was employed, gathering data through interviews and field observations with seven cattle farmers from Boyolali and Salatiga, two districts recognized for their significant cattle farming activities. The analysis focused on four key dimensions of sustainability: environmental integrity, social well-being, economic resilience, and good governance. It was found that while farmers implement various sustainable practices, such as crop rotation and the use of organic fertilizers, significant challenges remain. These include limited access to environmentally friendly technologies, inadequate financial resources, and insufficient government policy support. The selection of participants was based on their ability to provide in-depth insights into sustainability practices in cattle farming, complementing the qualitative data collected. The findings highlight the necessity of improving technological adoption and enhancing community engagement to drive more sustainable outcomes in the sector. Additionally, the study underscores the role of policymakers in fostering more supportive environments for sustainable agriculture. This research fills a critical gap in the literature on the sustainability of cattle farming in Indonesia, offering practical recommendations to stakeholders, including policymakers, to promote more resilient and environmentally sustainable farming practices. By detailing the current practices and challenges encountered by farmers, the study contributes to the development of informed agricultural policies aimed at ensuring long-term sustainability within the cattle farming sector in Indonesia.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The issue of sustainability in the agricultural sector has become increasingly urgent as global attention to the environmental impacts of agricultural and livestock activities intensifies. In recent years, the focus on sustainability has evolved from merely ensuring sufficient food production to a more holistic understanding of how agricultural practices can affect environmental, social, and economic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Tilman et al., 2017</xref>). The cattle farming sector, as a key component of agricultural systems, plays a crucial role in this regard. Cattle farming not only significantly contributes to the provision of animal protein but also has considerable environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and high water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>). With the increasing global demand for meat products, the sustainability challenges in cattle farming have become more complex and require in-depth attention.</p><p>Indonesia, as one of the major agrarian countries in Southeast Asia, has an important cattle farming sector both economically and socially. Cattle farming in Indonesia not only provides meat as a primary protein source but also serves as a livelihood for many small-scale farmers in rural areas. The economic and social roles of cattle farming in Indonesia make it a key component of the country’s agricultural system. However, farming practices in Indonesia often face various challenges regarding sustainability, including land degradation, inefficient water use, and high greenhouse gas emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Zaninotto et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.1. Safa</title>
          
          <p>In this context, it is essential to have an effective approach to assess and enhance sustainability in cattle farming. One widely used framework for assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems is the SAFA. The SAFA framework, developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), offers a comprehensive and holistic approach to evaluating various aspects of sustainability in food and agriculture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">FAO, 2014</xref>). SAFA includes four main dimensions: environmental integrity, social well-being, economic resilience, and good governance, providing useful tools for evaluating and improving sustainability across various agricultural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">FAO, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The SAFA framework, introduced by FAO in 2013, serves as a comprehensive tool for assessing the sustainability of agricultural and food systems. It is designed to cover a broad range of sustainability aspects with a specific focus on the agriculture and food sectors. The main components of SAFA include:</p><p>a) Economic resilience: Evaluates financial well-being and market access for stakeholders in the agricultural value chain.</p><p>b) Environmental integrity: Ensures agricultural practices that maintain soil quality, water resources, biodiversity, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>c) Social well-being: Focuses on the social conditions of farmers and communities, including labor rights, health, safety, and gender equity.</p><p>d) Good governance: Involves transparency, legitimacy, civil responsibility, and fair resource appropriation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">FAO, 2013</xref>).</p><p>SAFA is different from other sustainability assessment methods as follows:</p><p>a) Holistic and multidimensional: SAFA not only assesses sustainability from an environmental perspective but also incorporates economic, social, and governance dimensions, making it more comprehensive.</p><p>b) Specific to agriculture and food systems: Unlike general sustainability assessment methods, SAFA is tailored to address the unique complexities of the agricultural and food sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">FAO, 2014</xref>).</p><p>c) Tiered approach: SAFA uses a hierarchical approach with more detailed indicators across each dimension, compared to other methods that may have fewer, less nuanced indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">FAO, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Its relevance to this study lies in its ability to evaluate sustainability in the agricultural sector by considering economic, environmental, social, and governance aspects. This makes it well-suited for analyzing sustainable practices among cattle farmers in Boyolali and Salatiga, Indonesia.</p><p>The application of SAFA in different contexts has shown significant benefits in providing a deep understanding of sustainability. For instance, in Europe, SAFA has been applied to assess sustainability in organic farming, demonstrating improvements in resource efficiency and farmer well-being. However, despite SAFA’s widespread use across various countries and sectors, its application in the context of cattle farming in Indonesia remains very limited. This creates a gap in the literature that needs to be filled to provide practical guidance and local relevance in efforts to enhance sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">El Bilali, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Scoones, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the challenges faced by small-scale cattle farmers in Indonesia are not only technical but also related to policies and government support. Many small farmers encounter barriers to accessing new and practical environmentally friendly technologies and often lack support for adopting better sustainable practices. These factors require special attention in efforts to implement SAFA principles and improve sustainability practices at the local level.</p><p>It is crucial to assess in-depth how cattle farmers in Indonesia manage their sustainability practices and the challenges they face. By conducting qualitative analysis through interviews and in-depth observations, this study aims to provide a better understanding of sustainability management among cattle farmers and how the SAFA framework can be effectively applied in the local context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Fraser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">O’Brien &amp;amp; Leichenko, 2000</xref>). After exploring existing practices and identifying constraints faced by farmers, this study provides insights on how SAFA principles can help enhance sustainability in the cattle farming sector.</p><p>Through this analysis, this research aims to not only fill the gap in the literature on cattle farming sustainability in Indonesia but also offer practical suggestions for stakeholders in their efforts to enhance sustainability in this sector. By providing in-depth insights into existing sustainability practices and challenges faced, this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable policies and practices in cattle farming in Indonesia.</p><p>Focusing on the application of SAFA and qualitative analysis, this research aims to provide useful guidance for policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders in their efforts to manage cattle farming practices more sustainably. This is expected to encourage the adoption of better practices and improve sustainability in Indonesia’s cattle farming system, as well as provide a model that can be applied in other countries with similar contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Godfray et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sustainability in agricultural systems refers to the ability of these systems to meet current food needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Godfray et al., 2018</xref>). This concept involves three main dimensions: environmental sustainability, social well-being, and economic viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">FAO, 2020</xref>). The environmental dimension encompasses the efficient use of natural resources and the minimization of negative impacts on ecosystems. The social dimension focuses on community welfare, including workers' rights and farmer well-being. Meanwhile, the economic dimension refers to fair profits and financial sustainability for all parties involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Pretty et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

          <p>One important approach in sustainability assessment is the SAFA developed by FAO. SAFA provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems by considering various relevant indicators across four main dimensions: environmental, social, economic, and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">FAO, 2014</xref>). SAFA allows for a holistic and integrative assessment of various sustainability aspects, which is essential for identifying strengths and weaknesses in agricultural practices.</p>

            <title>1.3. Environmental impacts of cattle farming</title>
          
          <p>Cattle farming has significant environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Poore &amp;amp; Nemecek, 2018</xref>). Methane emissions from cattle digestion processes are a major contributor to climate change. Methanogenic digestion processes produce methane, a greenhouse gas that is more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Shindell et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, cattle farming requires extensive land for feed production, often leading to deforestation and land degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Zaninotto et al., 2020</xref>). Water use in cattle farming is also significant for both livestock consumption and feed production, impacting local water resources.</p>

            <title>1.4. Sustainable practices in cattle farming</title>
          
          <p>Sustainable practices in cattle farming aim to reduce negative environmental impacts and enhance production efficiency. One introduced practice is the use of more efficient feed and waste management technologies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and resource usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Jaakamo et al., 2019</xref>). Innovations such as carefully selected plant-based feed systems can help reduce methane emissions and improve productivity. Additionally, waste management technologies such as biogas can mitigate livestock waste impacts and generate renewable energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Mottet et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.5. Social and economic welfare in cattle farming</title>
          
          <p>Social and economic welfare is an essential aspect of sustainability that is often overlooked in farming practices. Social welfare encompasses workers' rights and fair working conditions, while economic welfare involves fair profits for farmers and financial sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">de Olde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">El Bilali, 2019</xref>). In many developing countries, including Indonesia, small farmers often face challenges accessing technologies and markets that can enhance their welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Knickel &amp;amp; Renting, 2018</xref>). Government support and policies that facilitate the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies and provide training for small farmers can play a crucial role in enhancing social and economic welfare.</p>

            <title>1.6. Policy implementation and government support</title>
          
          <p>Government policies and support have a significant impact on the sustainability of farming systems. Governments can provide incentives for adopting environmentally friendly technologies and support small farmers through training and resource access. Policies that encourage innovation in farming practices and environmental protection can help reduce the negative impacts of cattle farming and enhance the overall sustainability of agricultural systems. However, existing policies often do not fully accommodate the specific needs of small farmers or adequately support sustainability enhancement efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Altieri &amp;amp; Nicholls, 2017</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.7. Innovation and technology in sustainability</title>
          
          <p>Innovation and technology play a vital role in enhancing sustainability in cattle farming. New technologies in feed and waste management can reduce environmental impacts from farming and increase production efficiency. Agroforestry systems and crop-livestock integration are innovative approaches that can improve sustainability by leveraging synergies between crops and livestock. Additionally, data-driven approaches and information technology can assist in monitoring and managing agricultural systems more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Jaakamo et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.1. Research design</title>
          
          <p>This study employs a qualitative method to explore and uncover sustainability activities in cattle farming practices in Indonesia. The qualitative method was chosen because of its ability to provide in-depth understanding of farmers' experiences, perspectives, and practices in the context of sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Cresswell &amp;amp; Poth, 2016</xref>). This research aims to identify and analyze how cattle farmers in Indonesia implement sustainability principles, using the SAFA as a framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">FAO, 2014</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.2. Location and participants</title>
          
          <p>Boyolali and Salatiga were chosen for their reputations in significant cattle farming practices and the diversity of methods used. The research was conducted in these two locations, which are known for their substantial cattle farming activities. The selection of these locations is based on criteria such as farming intensity and the diversity of farming practices in both districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Yin, 2018</xref>). From these two locations, a total of seven cattle farmers were purposively selected to provide a comprehensive overview of sustainability practices in cattle farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Palinkas et al., 2015</xref>). </p><p>Although the sample size is only seven, this qualitative approach allows for an in-depth exploration of how cattle farmers apply sustainability principles locally. Qualitative research does not aim for generalization but seeks to understand phenomena deeply and contextually. Moreover, it is emphasized that in case studies, a small sample size is often sufficient as long as the data obtained is rich and relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Yin, 2018</xref>). Therefore, a small sample can provide deeper insights into sustainability dynamics at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Patton, 2015</xref>). As for the selection of participants, individuals deemed capable of providing in-depth and relevant information about sustainability practices in cattle farming were chosen to complement the data collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Shieh et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.3. Data collection techniques</title>
          
          <p>Observations in this study were conducted biweekly over a six-month period. Each observation session lasted 2-4 hours, focusing on the routine activities of cattle farmers and the implementation of sustainability practices. The biweekly frequency was chosen to ensure consistent documentation of changes in livestock management practices, resource utilization, and waste management. This approach provided rich and in-depth data on the sustainability dynamics among cattle farmers in Boyolali and Salatiga.</p>

              <p>This dimension focuses on sustainable natural resource management and reducing the environmental impact of farming practices. Environmental integrity contributes to economic resilience by ensuring that resources remain available and supports social well-being by creating a healthy environment for the community.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> emphasizes that the four sustainability dimensions are interconnected and mutually influential. Good governance, as the most influential dimension, acts as the main driver in promoting sustainable practices across social well-being, economic resilience, and environmental integrity. Understanding these interconnections allows stakeholders to design more effective strategies to enhance sustainability in farming systems, especially within the context of the study in Boyolali and Salatiga.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study highlights the sustainability practices implemented by cattle farmers in Boyolali and Salatiga, Indonesia, utilizing the SAFA framework. The findings reveal that while various sustainable practices are in place, challenges remain in areas such as access to environmentally friendly technologies and government support. The key dimensions, i.e., environmental integrity, social well-being, economic resilience, and good governance, show the interconnectedness of sustainability factors. Farmers demonstrate awareness and efforts to enhance sustainability through biogas utilization, water conservation, and animal welfare practices. However, significant gaps remain in policy implementation and technological adoption. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, cooperatives, and farmers, offering recommendations to improve sustainability in the cattle farming sector in Indonesia. Enhanced collaboration, training, and support for adopting sustainable technologies are critical for achieving long-term sustainability goals.</p>
