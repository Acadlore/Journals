      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Environmental contamination, a consequence of diverse anthropogenic activities, has emerged as a global concern, critically impacting ecosystems and human health. The sources of environmental pollutants are manifold, leading to the introduction of harmful substances into various ecological compartments. Air pollution, attributable to emissions from vehicular, industrial, and power generation activities, is characterized by the release of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. These pollutants are known to compromise air quality and pose substantial health risks. In aquatic environments, pollution manifests through industrial effluents, agricultural runoff laden with pesticides and fertilizers, mismanagement of waste, and untreated sewage, thereby threatening aquatic life, ecosystems, and human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Soil contamination, resulting from chemical spills, industrial waste disposal, mining activities, and agrochemical applications, leads to the accumulation of heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and other toxicants, adversely affecting soil health, plant growth, and groundwater quality. The prevalence of plastic pollution, exacerbated by the excessive use and improper disposal of plastic products, is evident in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, posing significant threats to wildlife. Radioactive contamination, arising from nuclear power plant accidents, inappropriate disposal of radioactive waste, and nuclear testing, impacts soil, water, and biota. Urbanization and industrialization contribute to noise pollution, with detrimental effects on human and wildlife health. Additionally, light pollution, stemming from excessive artificial nocturnal lighting, disrupts natural ecosystems, wildlife behavior, and human health. Thermal pollution, characterized by the discharge of heated industrial effluents into natural water bodies, alters the thermal regimes of aquatic ecosystems, negatively impacting species adapted to specific temperature ranges. These diverse forms of environmental contamination underscore the multifaceted nature of human-induced environmental impacts, leading to ecological degradation, health issues, and biodiversity loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>In the context of escalating environmental pollution, remediation and wastewater treatment have become paramount in mitigating pollution and preserving ecological integrity. The pursuit of sustainable methods in these areas is increasingly recognized as vital for ensuring long-term environmental resilience and societal well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The accumulation of contaminants, including heavy metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and emergent pollutants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is a direct consequence of industrial, agricultural, and waste management practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. These contaminants, pervasive in the environment, pose significant threats to ecosystem health, leading to soil degradation, water contamination, and loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, their persistent nature raises concerns regarding human health, being implicated in various diseases, congenital anomalies, and other health complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, remediation practices have predominantly focused on containment and removal of pollutants, often neglecting considerations of long-term environmental sustainability. Sustainable remediation, in contrast, adopts a holistic approach that integrates environmental, social, and economic facets, aiming to minimize the ecological footprint of remediation activities while enhancing their beneficial impacts. Through considerations such as energy efficiency, material utilization, and the preservation of ecosystem services, sustainable remediation offers more environmentally sound solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of wastewater, essential for the removal of contaminants from domestic, industrial, and agricultural effluents prior to their environmental release, traditionally relies on methods that, while effective, often entail high energy consumption and generate substantial sludge and waste. Sustainable approaches in wastewater treatment emphasize resource recovery, energy efficiency, and reducing environmental impacts of treatment processes. Innovations such as membrane filtration, anaerobic digestion, and the use of constructed wetlands are increasingly being employed for sustainable wastewater management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>The discharge of contaminants into the environment, whether through industrial effluents or untreated sewage, poses serious threats to ecosystems. Heavy metals, for instance, can bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms, disrupting physiological processes and diminishing biodiversity. The presence of pesticides and pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems can impair the growth and survival of aquatic organisms. Microplastics, defined as small plastic particles, are ingested by marine life, potentially entering the food chain and causing broad ecological disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Human health risks associated with contaminated water sources are significant. Ingestion of polluted water can lead to acute and chronic health impacts, contingent upon the nature and concentration of the contaminants. High levels of heavy metals such as lead and mercury are linked to neurological damage, developmental disorders, and organ dysfunction. Pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting chemicals in water sources are associated with reproductive disorders and hormonal disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>In addressing environmental pollution and its ramifications, sustainable remediation and wastewater treatment provide comprehensive solutions. These approaches strive to curtail the release of pollutants into the environment, diminish resource consumption, and enhance resource recovery. The implementation of sustainable practices, encompassing green remediation strategies, the utilization of renewable energy sources, and the adoption of circular economy principles in wastewater treatment, can significantly mitigate the adverse impacts of pollution, contributing to a healthier environment and improved human well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>The threat posed by environmental pollution to ecosystems and human health underscores the necessity of sustainable practices in remediation and wastewater treatment. By encompassing environmental, social, and economic considerations, these approaches offer effective solutions while reducing detrimental effects on ecosystems and human welfare. The adoption of these sustainable practices heralds a future where pollution is effectively managed, and environmental resources are conserved for future generations.</p>

      <title>2. Membrane technology: fundamentals and types</title>
      <p>Membrane technology, recognized for its efficiency, versatility, and cost-effectiveness, has become a pivotal approach in wastewater treatment. The core principle of this technology, membrane separation, relies on size exclusion, molecular diffusion, and electrostatic interactions for effective contaminant removal. In membrane separation, size exclusion is the primary mechanism where contaminants are selectively retained or passed based on their size. The membrane serves as a physical barrier, permitting the passage of smaller molecules or particles, while larger contaminants are retained. The pore size of the membrane is critical in determining the effectiveness of separation, with contaminants larger than the pore size being rejected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>Molecular diffusion is another key principle in membrane separation. This process entails the movement of solutes from a region of higher concentration to a lower concentration. Within the context of wastewater treatment, dissolved contaminants in the feed solution diffuse across the membrane, driven by the concentration gradient, leading to their separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>Electrostatic interactions are integral in specific membrane separation processes like electrodialysis and membrane capacitive deionization. These methods employ ion-selective membranes, allowing the passage of ions based on their charge. Electrostatic forces facilitate the attraction or repulsion of ions, aiding in their separation. The application of an electric potential across the membrane allows for the selective transport of ions, thus contributing to the removal of charged contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>The pore size and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane are decisive in determining the efficiency of separation in wastewater treatment applications. An appropriate membrane pore size is essential for efficient separation, based on the size of the contaminants in the wastewater. For example, microfiltration (MF) membranes, with larger pore sizes <inline-formula>

            <title>2.1. Classification of membrane processes</title>
          
          <p>Membrane technologies have significantly advanced diverse sectors, including water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. These technologies employ membranes of varied types to segregate contaminants based on size, molecular weight, and other properties. An overview of four principal membrane processes, namely, MF, UF, NF, and RO, is provided, elucidating the differences in their pore sizes, operating pressures, and separation capabilities, thereby illuminating their distinct applications.</p>
          
            <sec disp-level="level3">
              
                <title>2.1. 1 Mf</title>
              
              <p>MF employs membranes characterized by relatively large pore sizes, typically within the range of 0.1 to $10 \mu \mathrm{m}$. This process is principally engaged in the removal of suspended solids, bacteria, and larger particles from liquid streams. MF is effective in extracting bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), indicative of fecal contamination in water sources, Salmonella spp., prevalent in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals, Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, often encountered in soil, water, and healthcare environments, Campylobacter spp., associated with foodborne illnesses, and Enterococcus spp., indicative of fecal matter contamination in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Operated at relatively low pressures, typically under 2 bar (30 psi), the membrane serves as a physical barrier, facilitating the passage of smaller particles while retaining larger ones. Applications of MF are widespread, encompassing water treatment, wastewater reclamation, and the food and beverage industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p>

              <p>UF, utilizing membranes with smaller pore sizes compared to MF, features pore sizes ranging from 0.001 to $0.1 \mu \mathrm{m}$. UF is adept at removing macromolecules, colloids, proteins, and viruses from liquid streams. It is effectively used for the extraction of various viruses, including Hepatitis A virus (HAV), transmitted via contaminated food or water, Norovirus, responsible for gastrointestinal illnesses, Rotavirus, causing severe diarrhea in children, Adenovirus, linked to respiratory and other infections, and Enteroviruses, associated with a range of conditions from colds to more severe diseases like meningitis and myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. UF operates at slightly elevated pressures compared to MF, typically in the range of 1 to 10 bar (15-150psi), and finds applications in diverse fields such as water and wastewater treatment, dairy processing, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p>

              <p>NF, a membrane process, serves as an intermediate between UF and RO in terms of pore size and separation capacity. NF membranes, characterized by their smaller pore sizes typically ranging from 0.001 to $0.01 \mu \mathrm{m}$, facilitate the removal of divalent ions, organic molecules, and certain monovalent ions. This process is notably effective in extracting various contaminants, including divalent salts such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfate ions, specific organic compounds like pesticides and some dyes, and heavy metal ions including lead, mercury, and cadmium, leveraging its size exclusion properties. In addition, NF is adept at removing bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Operated within the pressure range of 10 to 30 bar (150-450 psi), NF finds widespread application in water softening, color and odor removal, desalination, and selective separation of specific ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p>

              <p>RO employs membranes with the smallest pore sizes among the discussed membrane processes, typically below $0.001 \mu \mathrm{m}$. RO is highly effective in eliminating salts, small organic molecules, and other dissolved contaminants. Operating at high pressures, typically between 20 to 100 bar (300-1500psi), RO overcomes osmotic pressure to achieve efficient separation. It is extensively utilized in applications such as desalination, production of ultrapure water, water reuse, and concentration of various solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>Collectively, membrane processes including MF, UF, NF, and RO provide versatile solutions for a wide array of separation needs. These processes are distinguished by their pore sizes, operating pressures, and separation capabilities, which enable the effective removal of contaminants of varying sizes and properties. Understanding the distinct characteristics of these membrane processes is crucial for their optimal selection and application in industries like water treatment, food processing, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

          <p>The critical role of municipal wastewater treatment in safeguarding public health and environmental integrity has been increasingly addressed through advancements in technology, including the adoption of membrane processes. Membrane filtration, notable for its capacity to effectively remove suspended solids, pathogens, and micropollutants, has garnered significant attention in wastewater management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>].</p><p>The challenge of suspended solids in wastewater, which can cause blockages and ecological disturbances, is effectively mitigated by membrane filtration. MF and UF membranes, in particular, demonstrate high effectiveness in solids removal while maintaining low transmembrane pressure. This efficiency enhances the performance of wastewater treatment facilities by improving solids separation and reducing the burden on subsequent treatment stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p><p>Pathogens in wastewater represent a substantial public health risk. Traditional treatment methods such as sedimentation and disinfection are often limited in pathogen removal efficacy. Membrane processes, leveraging their small pore sizes and barrier properties, offer superior pathogen removal. UF and NF membranes, capable of filtering a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, serve as effective physical barriers. This results in the production of high-quality effluent that conforms to stringent regulatory standards for discharge or reuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p><p>The presence of micropollutants, encompassing pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting compounds, poses a significant challenge for conventional wastewater treatment methods. Membrane processes, particularly NF and RO, have demonstrated promising capabilities in micropollutant removal. Utilizing mechanisms of size exclusion and charge-based rejection, these membranes significantly reduce micropollutant concentrations in effluent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>Membrane filtration offers several advantages over conventional wastewater treatment methods.

            <title>2.6. Mbrs for enhanced wastewater treatment efficiency</title>
          
          <p>MBRs, an advanced technology in wastewater treatment, have garnered increasing attention due to their ability to enhance treatment efficiency and produce superior effluent quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. MBRs represent a synergistic integration of biological processes with membrane filtration, distinct from traditional activated sludge systems where a clarifier or settling tank separates biomass from treated water. In MBRs, the membrane module serves as the solid-liquid separation unit, eliminating the need for secondary clarifiers. The membrane, acting as a physical barrier, permits the passage of water and dissolved substances while retaining suspended solids, microorganisms, and particulate matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>].</p><p>The fusion of biological treatment with membrane filtration in MBRs offers several benefits. A pivotal advantage is the efficient solid-liquid separation achieved by the membrane, resulting in a higher biomass concentration within the system. This elevated biomass concentration enhances treatment efficiency as microorganisms have extended contact time with wastewater, leading to more effective pollutant removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Additionally, MBRs provide improved control over hydraulic retention time (HRT) and solids retention time (SRT), critical parameters in wastewater treatment. The HRT can be modulated by adjusting the filtration rate, optimizing treatment processes, while the increased SRT, owing to higher biomass concentration, augments the degradation of organic matter and nutrient removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>].</p><p>MBRs exhibit several advantages over conventional wastewater treatment methods. Notably, the higher biomass concentration in MBRs allows handling of increased organic loads, yielding a more efficient treatment process. This capacity also enables MBRs to adapt to varying flow rates and pollutant loadings, enhancing their flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Additionally, MBRs significantly reduce sludge production. As the membrane retains biomass, minimal sludge loss occurs during solid-liquid separation, decreasing waste generation and associated handling and disposal costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, MBRs produce effluent of markedly superior quality compared to traditional methods. The membrane effectively removes suspended solids, pathogens, and a wide range of pollutants, ensuring effluent compliance with stringent regulatory standards for discharge or reuse. This improved effluent quality renders MBRs suitable for diverse applications, including water reuse and irrigation, particularly in environmentally sensitive areas. The compact design of MBRs, resulting in a smaller footprint, is advantageous for both centralized and decentralized wastewater treatment facilities. Their modular nature facilitates easy expansion or retrofitting, accommodating future growth and population increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p>

Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), with their tubular structure and high aspect ratios, provide efficient pathways for water molecule movement, contributing to increased membrane permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>]. These nanotubes serve as nanochannels, facilitating swift flow of water or selected ions through the membrane, thereby enhancing transport properties. CNTs, similar to graphene oxide, can undergo surface functionalization to modify their properties, allowing for selective interactions with specific molecules or ions, which enhances membrane selectivity. When embedded within the membrane matrix, CNTs contribute to improved mechanical strength and structural integrity, reducing fouling and extending the membrane's lifespan. When graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes are integrated into membrane structures, often in conjunction with polymeric or ceramic matrices, they induce synergistic effects. These effects manifest as enhanced permeability, selectivity, and mechanical strength, leading to significant improvements in membrane performance. The incorporation of these nanomaterials results in membranes that exhibit higher flux rates, better resistance to fouling, improved selectivity for specific molecules or ions, and greater durability compared to conventional membranes. Such advancements hold substantial promise for broad applications, including water treatment, desalination, purification, and various separation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>].</p><p>Addressing fouling, a significant challenge in membrane technology, is a key area for future advancements.
