      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the contemporary business landscape, the outlook has broadened beyond simply financial gain. Businesses are redefining success by prioritizing environmental principles, social responsibility, and ethical ideals. The notions of managerial sustainability and ethics are of utmost importance in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">GRI, 2023</xref>). The concept of sustainability and ethics is a managerial strategy that seeks to achieve a harmonious equilibrium between the environmental, social, and economic effects of businesses, with the goal of ensuring their enduring prosperity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Bal, 2019</xref>). Managerial sustainability and ethics pertain to the process by which corporations establish, execute, and oversee sustainability objectives. Furthermore, it assists firms in achieving long-term success by endeavoring to maintain a harmonious equilibrium between their environmental, social, and economic influences. Managerial sustainability and ethics have become crucial in the business world, as companies want to not only make profits but also contribute to society and preserve natural resources. Managerial sustainability and ethics refer to a managerial approach that focuses on organizations identifying, implementing, and overseeing their sustainability and ethical objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Mistrean, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Öztürk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Singh et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study is to examine the role of managerial sustainability and ethics in business success and underscore the prevalence of these concepts in the business world. Additionally, it aims to elucidate how managerial sustainability and ethics contribute to business success and present the latest research and findings in this field. Today's businesses must not only create economic value but also consider their environmental and social impacts and ethical values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">SASB, 2023</xref>). Businesses are urged to prioritize the sustainable utilization of natural resources, fair and ethical workforce management, and the delivery of products and services that align with societal needs. Despite this call, there persist numerous challenges and deficiencies in optimizing management practices and policies related to managerial sustainability and ethics, as highlighted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">UNEP (2023)</xref>. This study endeavors to assess the impact of managerial sustainability and ethics on business success through a thorough analysis of credible and current academic sources. It seeks to explore the key components integral to managerial sustainability and ethics, further solidifying the discussion by delving into methodological approaches using case studies and success stories.</p><p>In addition to evaluating the overarching influence, the study aims to elucidate the topic, offering a detailed examination of the subject matter. It will explore various methodological approaches, employing case studies and success stories to illustrate practical applications. The ultimate goal is to furnish valuable insights that can guide business leaders, academics, and policymakers in comprehending the substantial role played by managerial sustainability and ethics in achieving business success.</p><p>To provide a more detailed definition of the research, it is crucial to elaborate on the method selection and implementation, including data sources, sample selection, analytical tools, and the rationale behind these choices.</p><p>In the context of today's business world, where an in-depth understanding of managerial sustainability and ethics is essential, careful consideration of the methods to be used in this study is paramount. Accordingly, the identification of data sources that will form the foundation of the research is crucial, taking into account the reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness of these sources. For instance, the utilization of diverse data sources such as literature reviews, industry reports, company documents, and expert opinions can enhance the comprehensiveness of the research.</p><p>Sample selection is a critical factor influencing the overall validity and representativeness of the research. The careful selection of the sample should reflect the diversity in the business world, incorporating examples from different sectors and sizes to ensure the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>The selection and justification of analytical tools and methods are pivotal in facilitating the effective analysis of the acquired data. In this phase, it is important to articulate the rationale behind choosing analytical tools such as statistical methods, content analysis, or case studies. For example, numerical indicators may be employed to evaluate sustainability performance, while qualitative data analysis methods can be chosen for a deeper exploration of ethical practices.</p>

Managerial sustainability can help an organization achieve the following goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">WEF, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Managerial sustainability can help an organization use resources more efficiently, reduce waste and emissions, prevent environmental pollution, improve employee well-being and safety, improve relationships with local communities and benefit society.</p><p>More specifically, managerial sustainability can provide the following: Cost savings: More efficient use of resources can help reduce costs and increase profitability. Competitive advantage: Sustainability practices can help businesses gain a competitive advantage and access new markets. Reputation and reputation: Sustainability practices can help improve the reputation and reputation of businesses. Social benefit: Sustainability practices can help benefit society and create a better future. Managerial sustainability is becoming increasingly important for the long-term success of businesses. By adopting sustainability practices, businesses can reduce costs, gain competitive advantage, improve their reputation and benefit society.</p><p>In addition to the existing information, the following points can be added to further expand on the topic of managerial sustainability:</p><p>Innovation and Technological Integration: Managerial sustainability often involves embracing innovative technologies and practices to enhance environmental and social performance. The integration of cutting-edge technologies, such as renewable energy solutions or advanced waste management systems, can contribute to a more sustainable organizational framework.</p><p>Stakeholder Engagement: Engaging with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community, is a crucial aspect of managerial sustainability. Organizations can establish effective communication channels to gather feedback, address concerns, and foster collaboration, thereby ensuring a more comprehensive and inclusive sustainability approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Meznar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Supply Chain Management: Managerial sustainability extends beyond the organization's immediate operations to encompass its entire supply chain. Businesses can work towards ensuring that their suppliers adhere to ethical and sustainable practices, promoting a cascading effect that positively impacts the entire value chain.</p><p>Employee Training and Development: Organizations committed to managerial sustainability can invest in training programs to educate employees about the importance of sustainability practices. This can create a workforce that is not only environmentally conscious but also capable of implementing and championing sustainable initiatives within the organization.</p><p>Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management: Staying abreast of evolving environmental and social regulations is integral to managerial sustainability. Organizations should proactively comply with relevant laws and regulations while also identifying and managing potential sustainability-related risks, ensuring long-term resilience in the face of changing regulatory landscapes.</p><p>Circular Economy Practices: Embracing a circular economy model, which focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing the lifespan of products, is a key aspect of managerial sustainability. This approach involves designing products with recyclability in mind, promoting reuse, and minimizing the environmental impact of disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Savitz &amp;amp; Weber, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Measuring and Reporting: Establishing clear metrics and reporting mechanisms is essential for assessing the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. Regularly measuring and transparently reporting on key performance indicators related to sustainability goals can help organizations track progress and demonstrate their commitment to stakeholders.</p><p>Global Collaboration and Partnerships: Managerial sustainability efforts can be amplified through global collaboration and partnerships. Businesses can engage in collaborative initiatives with other organizations, NGOs, and governmental bodies to address complex sustainability challenges on a broader scale.</p><p>By incorporating these elements, the discussion on managerial sustainability can be broadened to encompass a more holistic and integrated approach to sustainable business practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Carroll, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The scope of managerial sustainability may vary depending on an organization's size, scope and objectives. However, in general, managerial sustainability includes the following elements:</p><p>Setting sustainability strategies and goals: To determine sustainability goals, an organization must first analyze its current situation. Then, one must develop strategies to achieve these goals and create a plan to implement these strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Kuşat, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Measuring and monitoring sustainability performance: An organization should regularly measure its performance to monitor the achievement of its sustainability goals. This may include measuring environmental, social and economic impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Özçelik, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Investing for sustainability: An organization must invest to achieve its sustainability goals. This may include investing in new technologies, improving environmental practices, and educating employees on sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">UNEP, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Managerial sustainability is critical to the success of an organization's sustainability efforts. Managerial sustainability supports the long-term success and sustainability of an organization by enabling an organization to identify sustainability goals, develop strategies to achieve them, and implement these strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">WEF, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Management sustainability means that an organization's management approaches, practices and decisions are focused on supporting long-term success and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Baranov &amp;amp; Stratan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Kaypak, 2011</xref>). This concept aims to preserve resources and opportunities for future generations by addressing the environmental, social and economic impacts of businesses in a balanced manner. Here are some key elements that will help us understand the sustainability of management:</p><p>Environmental Awareness: Management is sensitive to using natural resources sustainably and minimizing environmental impacts. This may include energy efficiency, waste reduction, use of renewable energy and environmental protection strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Tokgöz &amp;amp; Önce, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Social Responsibility: Sustainable management has awareness of social responsibility. This may include ethical business practices, protection of workers' rights, community collaboration and outreach projects.</p><p>Economic Resilience: Management aims to ensure economic sustainability.

      <title>3. The relationship between sustainability and ethics in businesses</title>
      <p>The relationship between ethics and sustainability in businesses is becoming increasingly important in today's business world. The process of businesses integrating environmental, social and economic sustainability principles and ethical values into their business strategies enables businesses to reduce their environmental impacts, fulfill their social responsibilities and be economically successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Organik Kimya, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Sustainable and ethical products and practices are valued by modern consumers and stakeholders. This offers businesses the opportunity to gain a more solid position in the market. For example, a clothing company that uses sustainable and ethical materials will be more popular among environmentally conscious consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Organik Kimya, 2023</xref>). Sustainability and ethical strategies can reduce costs by optimizing energy and resource use. More efficient production and business processes can increase the profit margins of businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">EGIAD, 2023</xref>). Risks related to climate change, limited natural resources and social responsibility can pose serious threats to businesses. However, managerial sustainability and ethics have the potential to reduce these risks and make businesses more resilient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">EGIAD, 2023</xref>). Conscious consumers prefer businesses with sustainability and ethical commitments. This can increase the brand value of businesses. For example, a company that takes a leadership role in sustainability and ethics may gain greater trust and respect among consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Green Petition, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Managerial sustainability and ethics improve businesses' long-term planning abilities and help them better manage future uncertainties. For example, a company that develops a business model based on sustainability and ethics can better predict future market trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Green Petition, 2023</xref>). Businesses need to continue to integrate sustainability and ethical principles into their business strategies and contribute to the construction of a sustainable future. This will provide long-term benefits for both business and society and help realize the vision of a sustainable world.</p>

Circular economy is an economic model that aims to minimize waste and maximize the efficient use of resources by encouraging activities such as reuse, recycling and reproduction. Here are some examples of circular economy practices:</p><p>Product Design for Durability and Reusability: Designing products to be long-lasting, easily repairable, and modular so that components can be replaced or upgraded rather than disposing of the entire product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Evren, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Product as a Service: Companies offer products on a service basis rather than selling them directly. For example, instead of purchasing a printer, customers pay for the printing service and the company maintains and repairs the printer when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Çelik &amp;amp; Bengül, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Remanufacturing: Renewing used products and restoring them to new condition. For example, remanufactured automotive parts can extend the life of vehicles and reduce the need to manufacture new parts.</p><p>Recycling and Material Recovery: The collection and processing of materials such as paper, plastic, and metal to create new products. For example, recycled plastics can be used to produce new plastic products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Bulut &amp;amp; Çavuldur, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Waste to Energy (Wte): Converting waste materials into energy through processes such as incineration or anaerobic digestion. This reduces landfill waste and produces electricity or heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Öztürk &amp;amp; Özgüven, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Sharing the Economy: Platforms that facilitate the sharing or renting of goods and services, such as ride-sharing, home-sharing, and co-working spaces, promote resource efficiency and reduce overconsumption.</p><p>Upcycling: Transforming waste materials or discarded items into products of higher value or quality. For example, old denim jeans can be turned into stylish bags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Erol, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Textile Recycling: Collecting and recycling old textiles to create new clothing products, reducing the environmental impact of the fashion industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Burçin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Reducing Food Waste: Initiatives aimed at reducing food waste at various stages of the supply chain, from production and distribution to consumption. This may include redistributing excess food to those in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Demirbaş, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Reverse Logistics: Efficiently managing the return and recycling of products, especially in e-commerce, in order to reduce the environmental impact of product returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Batuk, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Leasing and Rental Models: We encourage manufacturers to design durable and repairable products by offering leasing or rental options for products such as electronics, furniture, and white goods.</p><p>Cradle to Cradle Certification: Certification programs that evaluate and promote products designed with a closed-loop life cycle and ensure that materials are recycled or converted into fertilizer at the end of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Güneş &amp;amp; Demirarslan, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Urban Mining: Recovery of valuable materials from electronic waste, construction and demolition debris, and other resources in urban areas to reduce the need to mine raw resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Topçu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Circular Supply Chains: Companies are rethinking their supply chains to minimize waste, reduce transportation emissions and promote sustainability.</p><p>Reusable Packaging: Companies are adopting reusable packaging systems to reduce single-use packaging waste.</p>
