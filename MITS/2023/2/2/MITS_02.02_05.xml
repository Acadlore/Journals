      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Climate change poses significant challenges to transportation systems worldwide, necessitating the development of resilient and sustainable infrastructure capable of withstanding and mitigating the impacts of changing climatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Climate change has become a significant threat to the global community, with severe implications for various sectors such as agriculture, health, and transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. As the world moves towards a more sustainable and resilient future, it is essential to develop transportation systems that can adapt to changing climatic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Railways have indeed emerged as a low-carbon and energy-efficient mode of transportation, making them an essential area of focus for research in the transportation sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. With their potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to other modes of transportation, such as road or air, railways play a crucial role in mitigating climate change impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Railway infrastructure planning and design are fundamental elements of a robust transportation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. The design of railway tracks, stations, bridges, signaling systems, and other critical components requires meticulous consideration to ensure optimal functionality, safety, and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. However, in the face of climate change, it is imperative to integrate adaptation strategies into the planning and design processes of railway infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Climate change poses various challenges to railway infrastructure, including extreme weather events, sea-level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. These factors can lead to increased risks of infrastructure damage, disruptions in operations, and compromised safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate climate change adaptation strategies into the planning and design of railway infrastructure to enhance its resilience and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Integrating climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning involves considering various aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. This includes selecting suitable locations for infrastructure development, considering future climate scenarios, assessing vulnerability to climate change impacts, and implementing appropriate design measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. For example, railway lines can be elevated or relocated to mitigate the risks of flooding or coastal erosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Bridges and other structures can be designed to withstand extreme weather events, and signaling systems can be enhanced to ensure efficient operation during challenging weather conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The integration of adaptation strategies should consider the use of resilient materials, sustainable construction practices, and innovative technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. This not only ensures the continuity of transportation services but also contributes to the overall goal of reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change impacts. Moreover, it promotes the efficient use of resources, minimizes environmental degradation, and improves the overall quality of transportation services. This research paper aims to present a comprehensive analysis of integrating climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning and design, focusing specifically on the case study of India.</p><p>This research study makes a significant contribution to the expanding field of knowledge on climate change adaptation in the transportation sector. It offers valuable insights that are relevant to policymakers, practitioners, and researchers dedicated to enhancing climate resilience in railway systems. By addressing the existing research gap regarding the integration of climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning, this study fills a crucial void and provides a clear roadmap for developing resilient and sustainable railway systems, not only in India but also in other contexts worldwide.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The infrastructure of railways plays a crucial role in global transportation systems, fostering economic and social expansion. However, the escalating effects of climate change pose significant challenges to the resilience and sustainability of global rail networks. This literature review examines extant research and best practices concerning the incorporation of climate change adaptation strategies into the planning and design of railway infrastructure. This review seeks to provide insights into the development of resilient and sustainable transport systems in the face of a changing climate by examining key themes and approaches. Numerous studies have emphasized the diverse and extensive effects of climate change on railway infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. These include rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, a rise in sea level, and shifting hydrological conditions. These effects can result in infrastructure deterioration, service interruptions, safety hazards, and increased maintenance costs. Understanding these climate change impacts is essential for developing effective railway adaptation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Efforts to incorporate climate change adaptation into the planning and design of railway infrastructure have resulted in a variety of strategies and policies. These strategies include engineering solutions (e.g., elevated tracks, improved drainage systems), operational adaptations (e.g., modified scheduling, emergency response plans) and institutional measures (e.g., climate risk assessments, capacity development) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. National and international policies, guidelines, and frameworks offer a broader context for the creation and implementation of adaptation strategies. To increase the climate-resilience of railway infrastructure, resilient design and construction practices are essential. Incorporating climate projections, vulnerability assessments, and risk management strategies into the planning and design phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. Future climate conditions may necessitate the use of sturdy foundations, adaptable materials, and adaptable structures in the design process. Moreover, nature-based solutions (e.g., green infrastructure, natural drainage systems) offer intriguing avenues for integrating adaptation measures. Multiple stakeholders must be actively involved for the integration of climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Collaboration is required between policymakers, transportation authorities, engineers, urban planners, local communities, and relevant experts. Participation of stakeholders facilitates the identification of local knowledge, priorities, and concerns, ensuring that adaptation measures correspond to societal requirements and aspirations.</p><p>Integration of climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning is crucial for decision-making processes. Cost-benefit analyses can evaluate the economic viability and long-term financial implications of adaptation measures. Inclusion of equity, accessibility, and the requirements of vulnerable populations are social considerations. Environmental considerations include reducing carbon emissions, preserving biodiversity, and promoting sustainable land use practices.</p><p>This literature review emphasizes the significance of incorporating climate change adaptation strategies into the planning and design of railway infrastructure in order to develop resilient and sustainable transportation systems. Existing research is synthesized to highlight the need for comprehensive assessments of climate change impacts, the formulation of adaptation strategies and policies, resilient design and construction practices, stakeholder engagement, and consideration of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. By incorporating these insights, policymakers, practitioners, and researchers can contribute to a more sustainable future by advancing the development of climate-resilient railway networks.</p>

      <title>4. Study area</title>
      <p>Indian Railways, one of the world's largest railway networks, serves as a lifeline for the nation's transportation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. It spans a vast network of tracks, connecting remote corners of the country and facilitating the movement of passengers and goods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. With a rich history dating back to the colonial era, Indian Railways has played a pivotal role in India's economic growth and social development. Indian Railways operates over 67,000 kilometers of track, linking more than 7,000 stations across the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. It carries an average of around 23 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight daily, making it a crucial mode of transport for both people and goods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. The railways provide various classes of travel, catering to different sections of society and facilitating the mobility of a diverse population. In recent years, Indian Railways has taken significant steps towards sustainability and environmental responsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. The adoption of electric locomotives has helped reduce carbon emissions, making it a relatively low-carbon mode of transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. Additionally, the railways have been increasingly focused on energy efficiency, with initiatives such as the use of regenerative braking systems and the installation of solar panels on station rooftops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].</p><p>However, Climate change poses a significant threat to the railway infrastructure in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Extreme weather events, such as floods and cyclones, can lead to track disruptions, infrastructure damage, and operational delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns also have implications for maintenance and operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. India is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events. The Indian railway infrastructure is susceptible to these climatic changes, leading to disruptions, damage, and safety concerns. Given these challenges, it becomes crucial to study and develop climate change adaptation strategies that can be integrated into railway infrastructure planning and design in India. Understanding the vulnerabilities, risks, and potential solutions specific to the Indian context will provide valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers working towards a resilient and sustainable transportation system.</p>

            <title>5.1. Current and projected climate change scenarios in india</title>
          
          <p>India, with its diverse geographical features and population, is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. The country has been experiencing noticeable changes in its climate patterns, with significant implications for various sectors including agriculture, water resources, and public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. In this analysis, we examined the current and projected climate change scenarios in India, drawing upon available data and scientific research (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). India has been experiencing a gradual increase in temperatures over the past few decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. Data from meteorological departments and climate studies indicate that both average temperatures and extreme heat events have been on the rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that the mean surface air temperature in India will continue to increase throughout the 21st century, with potential increases ranging from 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>Over last two decades, the average temperature fluctuates between a low of 26.5℃ in 2000 and a high of 27.5℃ in four different years (2004, 2005, 2011, and 2015). The average temperature in the remaining falls within a range of 0.5℃ from the overall average (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). One possible interpretation of these data might be that the temperature in the region represented by this data tends to peak around 27.3℃ several times, but stays relatively consistent around the high 26s/low 27s for the rest of the years. However, without additional information about other factors that can affect variation such as industrialization, land use changes, etc., this is merely a speculation.</p><p>Changes in precipitation patterns pose significant challenges for India's water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. Some regions are experiencing increased rainfall intensity and frequency, leading to more frequent and severe floods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. In contrast, other areas are witnessing prolonged periods of drought, with implications for water availability and agricultural productivity. Climate projections suggest that precipitation patterns will continue to change, with potential variations in both the timing and distribution of rainfall across different regions of India.</p><p>The mean rainfall is calculated as the sum of all rainfall divided by the number of observations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>). The mean rainfall over the 20-year period is 930.13 mm. The median rainfall is the middle value in a sorted list of all rainfall values. In this case, the median rainfall is 927.91 mm. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset. In this case, there is no single mode as none of the values occur more than once. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. In this case, the range of rainfall values is from 810.18 mm to 1,088.34 mm, which gives a range of 278.16 mm. The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the rainfall values around the mean.

      <title>7. Findings</title>
      <p>Through the analysis of historical climate data and projections, it was found that India is experiencing changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These climate change impacts pose significant risks and vulnerabilities to railway infrastructure in the country. A review of existing national and international climate change adaptation strategies and policies provided a framework for integrating adaptation measures into railway infrastructure planning and design. These strategies encompassed approaches such as resilient infrastructure design, nature-based solutions, and operational changes. By examining literature, research papers, reports, and case studies from around the world, several best practices and key principles for enhancing the resilience of railway systems were identified. These included flexible and modular infrastructure design, climate-informed decision-making processes, proactive risk management, and stakeholder engagement. The analysis of the Indian railway network revealed vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, particularly in tracks, stations, bridges, and signaling systems. Adaptation measures such as infrastructure modifications, engineering solutions, operational changes, and nature-based solutions were identified to enhance the resilience of the railway infrastructure. The integration of climate change adaptation strategies into railway infrastructure planning and design has significant economic, social, and environmental implications. While adaptation measures may entail increased construction costs, they offer benefits such as improved passenger safety, reduced disruptions, and lower carbon emissions, contributing to long-term sustainability. Through interviews with experts in railway infrastructure planning, climate change adaptation, and sustainable transportation, valuable insights were gained regarding challenges, opportunities, and best practices. Stakeholder engagement with policymakers, urban planners, transportation authorities, and railway operators in India provided input and recommendations for integrating adaptation strategies into railway systems. Analysis of existing policies and regulations identified barriers and gaps that hindered the integration of climate change adaptation measures, leading to proposed policy recommendations and interventions. This study highlights the significance of incorporating climate change adaptation strategies into the planning and design of India's rail infrastructure. The results contribute to the field of climate resilience in transportation systems by providing policymakers, practitioners, and researchers with valuable insights. The research findings emphasize the need for proactive measures to nurture climate-resilient and sustainable railway systems.</p>
