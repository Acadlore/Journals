      <abstract><p>In military defence and wildlife conservation operations, detecting camouflage in images poses a significant challenge. This research investigates the efficacy of deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), in addressing this challenge. The study meticulously evaluates each model's performance using metrics such as average accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss measures across well-known benchmark datasets comprising camouflaged and non-camouflaged images. Notably, the CNN + ANN Pipeline model emerges as the most effective, achieving a remarkable average accuracy of 91.37%. This model, together with the standalone CNN, outperforms the ANN and LSTM models in terms of camouflage detection. The discoveries advance the state-of-the-art in image analysis while also having practical implications for real-world applications. In military settings, good camouflage detection can improve situational awareness and danger detection capabilities. Similarly, automated camouflage detection helps monitor and protect endangered species by detecting hidden creatures or potential threats. Overall, this study highlights the ability of deep learning techniques to greatly improve visual analytic tasks across a variety of domains.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Future generations will be based on advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), hash AI, Explainable AI (XAI), etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] , [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. It may use unmanned systems to strike and detect the targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. It also leads to the development of camouflage technology, in which military devices blend in with the environment so that they cannot be detected with human observation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. This camouflage technique has posed significant challenges to UAV's military target striking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Machine learning (ML) techniques can play an important role in detecting various types of targets, and researchers have proposed numerous algorithms that use ML. However, there has been little consideration paid to military camouflaged target detection.</p><p>All of the offered ways using deep learning are grouped into two regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. To begin with, prospective regions were taken into consideration such as SPP-Net, ReCNN, etc. The next one is for ideas that involve regression, like SSD, YOLO, etc. The above-mentioned standard algorithms perform badly in camouflaged target detection since they fall into the trap of the edges and backdrop of camouflaged targets because the real battlefield conditions may include desert, woods, snow, etc. It is critical in the introduction to explain why specific models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were chosen to address the highlighted issues in camouflage target detection. These models were chosen based on their distinct capabilities and aptitude for addressing the issues given by camouflage technology. CNNs are ideal for image processing jobs because of their capacity to capture spatial hierarchies and learn complex patterns.</p>

      <p>In the context of camouflage detection, CNNs can rapidly extract features from photos, allowing the detection of small deviations and anomalies that may signal the existence of disguised targets in a variety of situations such as the desert, woodlands, or snow-covered terrain. ANNs provide flexibility in modelling nonlinear interactions within data, making them useful for analysing complicated and heterogeneous datasets related to camouflage detection. ANN designs enable the detection system to learn complicated patterns and correlations between multiple features, improving its capacity to accurately identify camouflaged targets in a variety of backgrounds and environmental situations. LSTMs, with their ability to identify temporal dependencies in sequential data, are useful in analysing dynamic circumstances in which camouflage targets may move or alter over time. By adding LSTM networks into the detection framework, the system can successfully track and analyse temporal patterns associated with camouflaged objects, hence boosting overall detection performance in dynamic combat settings. Furthermore, it is critical to highlight how the incorporation of these unique deep learning models overcomes the shortcomings of standard algorithms, which frequently struggle with edge identification and background noise in camouflage target recognition. The suggested approach intends to solve these issues by exploiting the enhanced capabilities of CNNs, ANNs, and LSTMs, hence improving the accuracy and reliability of camouflage detection systems in real-world military applications. Incorporating these additional insights into the introduction will provide a thorough understanding of the rationale for selecting specific deep learning models and how they are expected to handle the stated issues in camouflage target detection.</p>

            <title>1.1. Problem description</title>
          
          <p>There are a number of problems that must be solved before it will be possible to military camouflaged people in images as follows:</p><p><p>Due to the environment's constantly changing dynamics, it can be challenging to distinguish the texture, shape, and location of targeted camouflaged objects. For instance, the edges of targets in the desert, the desert sands, and the forest are easily absorbed into the surroundings.</p><p>It is quite challenging to get the labelled data necessary to train and evaluate a deep learning model during the data set collection phase.</p><p>The well-known datasets, ImageNet and VOC, cannot be used to detect and identify military targets that have been camouflaged.</p></p>

            <title>1.2. Overview of proposed methodology</title>
          
          <p>The Proposed method for detecting camouflage photographs makes use of a variety of deep learning models, including CNN, ANN, LSTM, and the CNN+ANN pipeline. These models were chosen for their distinct capabilities and aptitude for solving specific issues found in camouflage detecting tasks. The CNN is well-suited for extracting detailed spatial hierarchies and patterns from images, but the ANN is flexible in modelling nonlinear interactions within the data. LSTM, on the other hand, is very good at identifying temporal dependencies, which is important for analysing sequential data like image sequences or video streams. Furthermore, the CNN+ANN pipeline takes advantage of the complementing strengths of both models, combining robust feature extraction with sophisticated connection learning. The methodology seeks to solve the complexity of camouflage detection in a complete manner by utilising these several models. The models are evaluated using a variety of criteria, including average accuracy, validation accuracy, and average loss. Notably, the CNN+ANN pipeline outperforms all datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. Furthermore, the methodology's usefulness goes beyond military and defence contexts to include a wide range of disciplines, such as wildlife conservation. This study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques to improve camouflage detection operations and establishes the framework for future advances in this sector.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>A variety of approaches for detecting camouflage in images proposed by investigators have been discussed in this section along with the advantages over the existing terminologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] have proposed semi-supervised search identification network (Semi-SINet) based camouflaged military people detection system, in which, the camouflaged object detection dataset (COD10K) was taken into the consideration. It was observed that the proposed approach performance better than the existing approaches. But the obtained accuracy was low.</p><p>Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] suggested texture aware refinement module that separates the background in the camouflaged image, so that object can be easily detected. They applied the covariance matrices to get the texture information. In the performance analysis, COD10K and CAMO dataset were taken into the consideration. It was observed that the proposed model shows the superior performance, but still lacking to detect the dynamic camouflaged objects in the images.</p><p>Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] proposed the Context-aware Cross-level Fusion Network (C2F-Net), in which an information-based module was developed as a coefficient to detect camouflaged objects. A Dual-branch Global Context Module (DGCM) was also proposed to improve the informative-based features. The proposed C2F-Net performed better than state-of-the-art algorithms in the results, but a large dataset should be looked at for rigorous testing and analysis.</p><p>Lin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] addressed the issue of context aggregation strategies, where COD detection is difficult. They proposed a frequency-based context aggregation methodology known as FACA, which suppresses high frequency information. Furthermore, a gradient weighted loss function was developed to provide deep inside the contour details. During the experimentation and result analysis, it was discovered that the proposed mechanism outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques. But, still power of hybrid deep learning technique can be opted to enhance the accuracy.</p><p>For the COD, Fan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] proposed the SINet search identification network. They also gathered a dataset of 10,000 images known as COD10K, which serves as a benchmark dataset for testing various ML and deep learning-based models. During the experiments, it was discovered that the proposed SINet outperformed the existing works.</p><p>Shen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] proposed a COD mechanism using polarization imaging and deep learning. First, the polarization specificity is determined using the Stokes-vector-based parameter image in this methodology. The authors then suggested using the Otsu segmentation algorithm and morphological operations to highlight the target in the camouflaged-based images. In the end, 80% of the images were correctly identified, but accuracy still needs to be improved in order to be used in military and wildlife applications.</p>

              <p>In computer vision applications, notably in picture classification and object recognition, CNNs are a common form of deep neural network. The layers of neurons that make up a CNN each learn to extract a particular set of characteristics from the input data. The input picture is typically processed by a convolutional layer, which creates a collection of feature maps by applying a number of filters. These feature maps show where specific visual patterns, such corners or edges, are prevalent across the input picture.</p><p>The pooling layer down samples the feature maps by picking the most significant values from the output of the convolutional layer. The retrieved features' dimensionality is decreased as a result of this operation, which also improves the effectiveness of the network. The final classification decision is made by a sequence of fully linked layers after the pooled characteristics have been flattened. The CNN learns its weights by a technique known as backpropagation, in which the network modifies its settings to reduce the discrepancy between the training data expected and actual labels.</p>

              <p>A group of algorithms known as ANNs are modelled after the structure and operation of the human brain. These networks may be used for a variety of tasks, including image categorization, and are built to mimic the behaviour of organic neurons. ANNs are made up of several layers of synthetic neurons that process incoming data and provide predictions. Weights that are changed during training to improve the model's performance link the layers of neurons.</p><p>ANNs are a class of algorithms that are modelled after how the human brain functions. These networks are designed to resemble the action of biological neurons and may be utilised for a range of tasks, including picture classification. Multiple layers of artificial neurons make up ANNs, which process incoming data and offer predictions. The layers of neurons are connected by weights that are altered throughout training to enhance the model's performance.</p>

                <title>3.2.3 Long short-term memory (lstm)</title>
              
              <p>A special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called LSTM is made to deal with long-term dependencies in sequential input. In order to maintain information over time, LSTMs employ memory cells. This enables them to selectively forget or keep information depending on the input at each time step. The input gate, forget gate, and output gate are three different types of gates that regulate the memory cells. The memory cell's input gate selects how much fresh input should be fed to it, the forget gate chooses which data should be removed from the memory cell, and the output gate decides how much of the memory cell should be transmitted to the following layer.</p><p>LSTMs are advantageous for tasks requiring sequential input, like as voice recognition and natural language processing, where the network must retain context from earlier portions of the sequence. This is because LSTMs employ memory cells and gates. Widely employed in both business and academics, LSTMs have been demonstrated to perform better than conventional RNNs on a number of tasks. Sequential information can be useful in finding patterns in the photos, and this research uses LSTMs for the job of detecting camouflage. The pictorial representation of LSTM circuit is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

                <title>3.2.4 Cnn+ann</title>
              
              <p>The combination of CNN and ANN in a pipeline is a powerful deep learning approach used for image classification tasks. CNNs are effective in extracting features from images through convolutional and pooling layers. Meanwhile, ANNs excel in making predictions based on the features extracted by the CNNs. In this pipeline approach, the output of the convolutional layers from the CNN is fed as input to the fully connected layers of the ANN, which then produce the final classification output. Thus, this combination allows the model to leverage both the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the prediction capabilities of ANNs, making it a powerful tool for image classification tasks.</p><p>In comparison to using CNNs or ANNs alone, the pipeline approach has demonstrated improved performance in many image classification tasks. The pipeline technique is able to discover more complex patterns in the input data, producing more accurate classification results. This is accomplished by integrating the strengths of both CNNs and ANNs. The pipeline technique is also quite adaptable and can be tailored to match various image categorization jobs.</p>

            <title>4.1. Model architecture</title>
          
          <p>In this study, we trained and tested deep-learning models to classify camouflage images. The general architecture of the models consisted of a CNN followed by an ANN. The CNN portion of the model consisted of two convolutional layers, each with a 3x3 kernel size and ReLU activation function, followed by max-pooling layers with a 2×2 pool size. The output of the second max pooling layer was flattened and fed into the ANN portion of the model. The ANN consisted of three dense layers with a ReLU activation function and a final SoftMax activation function in the output layer. Dropout regularization with a rate of 0.5 was applied to the first dense layer of the ANN to prevent overfitting. The proposed model architecture is presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

          <p>The models were trained using the Adam optimizer, a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm that calculates adaptive learning rates for each parameter. The categorical cross-entropy loss function was used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual class labels. This is a common loss function used for multi-class classification tasks. The accuracy metric was used to evaluate the performance of the models. It represents the percentage of correctly classified images out of all images in the test set. The description of various sub-methodologies such as Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy and training procedure is provided in next subsections.</p>

              <p>A well-liked optimisation approach called Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is used in deep learning to adjust the neural network's weights as it is being trained. It is a stochastic gradient descent optimisation technique that brings together the advantages of momentum and RMSProp techniques. Based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradients, Adam adapts the learning rate for each parameter. In comparison to other optimisation techniques, this adaptive learning rate aids in faster convergence and better performance.</p>

              <p>A typical loss function in multi-class classification issues is categorical cross-entropy. It calculates the discrepancy between the target classes' actual probability distribution and the projected probability distribution. The SoftMax activation function is used to the last layer of the neural network to produce the anticipated probability distribution. The categorical cross-entropy loss function penalises the model when it assigns a low probability to the right class in an effort to reduce the gap between these two distributions.</p>

          <p>The models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32. The number of epochs varied depending on the model architecture and dataset but typically ranged from 50 to 100 epochs. Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay were applied to prevent overfitting.</p><p>The training and validation sets were split randomly with a ratio of 80:20, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% was used for validation. The models were evaluated during training by monitoring the training loss and validation loss, as well as the training accuracy and validation accuracy. The categorical cross-entropy loss function was used as the primary metric for evaluating the model's performance. Additionally, the accuracy metric was used to measure the percentage of correctly classified images in both the training and validation sets. The models were trained until convergence was reached, as determined by the absence of further improvements in the validation loss and accuracy.</p>

          <p>Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It measures the percentage of correctly predicted samples out of the total number of samples. Mathematically, accuracy is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples to the total number of samples. It is a useful metric when the classes are balanced, meaning that each class has roughly the same number of samples.</p>

It consist of 10,000 colored images. The objective of training models on such a dataset is to enable the model to detect and identify camouflaged objects in their natural environment. The dataset may contain examples of animals that utilize coloration, texture, or other physical characteristics to merge in with their environment.</p><p>A non-camouflage dataset contains images of objects that are not camouflaged and can be distinguished from their surroundings. These datasets are used to train and evaluate models for general object detection and recognition tasks, without the additional difficulty of camouflaged objects.</p>

            <title>6.1. Conclusion and summary</title>
          
          <p>The study goes thoroughly into deep learning approaches, with a particular emphasis on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which are formidable tools for handling the complex challenge of detecting camouflaged images. Through comprehensive investigation and rigorous comparison, the study reveals the extraordinary performance of the CNN + ANN pipeline model, which emerges as the unchallenged leader with the highest average accuracy across all scrutinised datasets. This robustness not only demonstrates the efficacy of the hybrid approach, which strategically combines CNN for feature extraction and ANN for classification, but also highlights its enormous potential across a wide range of practical applications, from military defence to wildlife conservation operations. While the abstract hinted at this extraordinary outcome, a more exact expression of specific accuracy values would surely strengthen the conclusions drawn and provide a more detailed understanding of the model's capabilities in compared to its competitors. Surprisingly, the accuracy of this hybrid model, CNN+ANN, is 91.37%, confirming its status as a powerful rival in the field of deep learning-based image analysis and pattern identification. This high level of accuracy not only demonstrates the model's efficacy, but also emphasises its dependability in real-world settings where precision is critical.</p>
