      <abstract><p>This paper summarizes the critical importance of the Cerrado savannah biome in Brazil and examines key ways in which large-scale agriculture, in particular large-scale soy farming, threatens water security and increases socio-ecological stress. It connects agribusiness expansion to the globalized meat industry by defining how complex economic relationships result in deforestation on a massive scale. It describes how this radical change in land cover has led to changes in rainfall patterns that are associated with extended drought periods and analyzes how these critical water shortages jeopardize socio-economic health beyond the immediate region. Further, it explicates how intensified transgenic soy farming and other pesticide-heavy crop production contributes to rising public health crises associated with carcinogen-contaminated water and food sources. Lastly, it identifies emerging trends that suggest how agribusiness corporations and governments may be legally ascribed moral responsibilities for maintaining socio-ecological health of the biome. The paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the human dimensions of environmental issues and their impacts and reframe conservation social science discourse in regard to protection of land and water resources in the region.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Cerrado is one of the most species-rich savannahs in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] and a hotspot of biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], yet less than 3% of its area is fully protected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. It is the second largest biome in South America and is the central biome that con-nects to four of the five other Brazilian biomes—the Amazon, Caatinga, Atlantic Forest and Pantanal. It occupies a con-tinuous region of more than two million km2, covers 23% of the country, and spans nine states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The headwaters of three of South America’s major river basins and several large aquifers are located within its territory. These hydrographic re-gions play a critical role in the distribution of water resources throughout the South American continent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>Large-scale agricultural producers are reshaping the Cer-rado on an extraordinary scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. The expansion and in-tensification of the soy industry is markedly accelerating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. From 2000 to 2014 the agricultural area of the Cerrado expanded by 87%, mainly for soybean production, which increased by 108% during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The biome al-ready accommodates 40 million cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] and cultivates more than fifteen million hectares of soy—90% of all agricul-ture in the Cerrado (2013/14 harvest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Soy production is predicted to continue to increase, in large part to provide agro-industrial feed for the global meat industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], particu-larly to meet demands in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] and to produce edible oil, biodiesel and industrial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. The expansion and intensification of soy, as the main agricultural commodity produced in the region, is contributing to changes in regional hydrology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] that effects water security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] and impacts the socio-environmental health of the region.</p><p>The expanding “ecological hoofprint” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] of China and Europe’s mega-meat industry is a primary driver of soy pro-duction on the Cerrado. Yet, understanding how a chain supermarket-bought steak on a European dinner table neg-atively impacts the ecological health of a Brazilian biome is not straightforward but comprises of a myriad of com-plex components that are part of a market-based global agri-food industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] of which soy is emblematic.</p><p>Large-scale production of soy is associated with loss, de-terioration and changes in the Cerrado’s biophysical founda-tions. It negatively impacts on native vegetation, soil, ground-water, hydrological patterns, and other elements essential to socio-ecological security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. These issues are not only attributable to soy but are interwoven into a transnational landscape that connects to other forms of grain and live-stock production and is supported by pro-growth federal and state policies engineered by a powerful agribusiness lobby disproportionally represented in Brazilian Congress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p><p>Transnational corporations significantly influence insti-tutionalized decision-making at a national level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. The rapid conversion to genetically modified (GM) key commod-ity crop production (soy, corn, and cotton) in the last two decades has dominated the political ecology of national agriculture, to affect the dynamics of farming, trade, and legislation. The introduction of GM soy in 2008 has acceler-ated an already expanding industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. In Brazil, 96% of soy is genetically modified (2016 harvest) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. Soy has now become the largest crop cultivated (by area) in the country, with an estimated 33.9 million ha planted in 2016/17 (to produce 114.1 million tons), 74% of which was to supply the export market, with China as the chief importer, followed by Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>].</p><p>Soy expansion has destroyed natural habitats over wide areas of both the Amazon and Cerrado, and has been ac-companied by massive transportation infrastructure projects that include industrial waterways, railway lines and road net-works that transport commodities to port [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. They further infringe into the biome by providing access for other private neo-extractivist activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] to expand.</p><p>Along with the expansion of GM soy has come a dramatic increase of agrotoxin use (chemical pesti-cides/herbicides), the technologies of which belong over-whelmingly to Monsanto (73.05%) followed by multination-als Dow AgroScience / DuPont and Syngenta (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. GM soy has dramatically changed farming on the Cerrado, not only in a material sense, but at an ideological level, as it is progressively transformed into a de-spatialized commod-ity that is divorced from negative socio-ecological account-ing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. As discussed later in this paper, large-scale soy production is justified by calculating dollar value commodity profit over tradable carbon stocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], while environmen-tal health impacts caused by pesticide contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] and the effects on changes in regional hydrology patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] are given inadequate policy attention, though they are increasingly significant problems. Thus, in closing, the pa-per signposts emerging ways forward that suggest how government and agribusiness may be held more legally responsible for their impacts on the Cerrado.</p>

      <title>2. Need</title>
      <p>By 2050, food production is predicted to increase by ap-proximately 70% worldwide, and by 100% in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. The demand for soy, much of it for live-stock feed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], and the large-scale mechanized meth-ods used to produce[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] and transport it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], are supported by a global free market system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>] tied to a pro-growth economic development model in critical need of revision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>]. Over the coming decades, this model will result in climate changes that are expected to contribute to water scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>] and declines in yields and price increases for key commodity crops such as soy, which will no longer be viable to cultivate in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>].</p><p>The Cerrado is part of an agricultural frontier that teeters on an ecological ‘tipping point’ as a result of intense pres-sure from agribusiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>], much of it in order to expand soybean production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>]. The consequences are enor-mous and interdependent, and at the same time unique to the biome. Ongoing examination of the environmental stressors the Cerrado faces are of crucial importance in order to understand what is necessary to ensure its socio-ecological survival. Investigations into hydrological insta-bility, safeguards for human health and wellbeing, and the deepening of discourses that critique the global free market food system and interrogate the culture of agro-extractivism are all essential to decouple discussions of sustainability from an economic model dependent on perpetual growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>]. This refocusing of development discourse must also include strategies whereby government and cor-porate entities are legally compelled to act in the capacity of socio-environmental stewards over the lands and waters that they use and control.</p>

      <title>3. Aims</title>
      <p>The aim of this paper is to:</p><p>a) contribute to existent conservation social science dis-course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>] analysis by analyzing key ways in which large-scale agriculture on the Cerrado (in partic-ular soy farming) limits socio-environmental security and impacts water resources;</p><p>b) frame ecological integrity as a moral obligation which may be legally applied to aid in reversing socio-ecological loss moving forward.</p>

      <title>4. Scope</title>
      <p>This paper investigates the environmental impact of large-scale soy farming in relation to key vulnerabilities by de-lineating how water security, in particular, is threatened by agribusiness. It defines the role that the Brazilian soy industry plays by building a narrative that relates land use to water resource strain, and linking it to a larger suite of land use practices that are transforming the Cerrado and effect-ing broader security issues. It focuses on soy as a primary and emblematic component of an agribusiness framework that is invested in building political and socio-economic per-ceptions and attitudes that value the Cerrado exclusively for its commodified worth.</p><p>The paper offers considerations for a pathway forward by proposing how emerging legal approaches can be used to intervene in governance to strengthen conservation ini-tiatives beyond the industry-led, market-based instruments currently in place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>].</p><p>Many topics are critical to informing the industry respon-sibility debate. Though each is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate in depth, collectively they form an ethi-cal basis for suggesting an alternative development pathway forward. They include: addressing environmental justice struggles faced by those that are dispossessed by or ex-posed to violence by a policy landscape that supports neo-extractivist industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">55</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">56</xref>] and unethical labor practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>]; interrogating conservation initiatives which are shaped almost exclusively by an array of market-based instruments such as subsidized credit lines, tax incentives and trade-off schemes, most of which favor large-scale landholders and privatization initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]; suggesting more rigorous trans-parency in multi-directional global commodity supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>]; dispelling a neoliberal land transformation imaginary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>]; and indicating emerging ways in which environmen-tal protection responsibilities may be legally ascribed to government and industry in the 21st century.</p><p>This paper may be of relevance to practitioners and theorists working in the fields of the conservation social sciences, specifically in areas of environmental sociology, land management, political ecology, development ethics, climate change litigation and environmental geography, with an interest in agribusiness, land use and water resources, but who are unfamiliar or less familiar how sustainability challenges relate to the Cerrado biome.</p>

      <title>5. Methods</title>
      <p>The methodological foundation for this paper is grounded in a critical discourse analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>] of existing Cerrado literature that identified common themes of drought, preservation, conserva-tion, sustainability, deforestation, degradation, carbon, contami-nation, changes in hydrology, pesticides, water security, environ-mental threats, conservation policy, land conflicts, social inequity, political ecology, socio-ecological loss and climate change im-pacts. Productivist discourses were identified with themes con-cerning higher production levels, economic gains, expansion, intensification, transportation, GDP, yields per tonne, corporate name brands (e.g. Monsanto, Amaggi, Cargill), technological production methods, irrigation, agribusiness policy, growth and sustainable development. Analysis of these key themes form what is essentially a review of Brazil’s agricultural, social and environmental policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>] as they relate to the Cerrado.</p>

      <title>6. Literature review</title>
      <p>Producing soy on the Cerrado depends on resource ex-ploitation that results in substantive socio-ecological loss, effects water resources, and contributes to hydrological change. An array of scholars provide a solid scientific foun-dation for explicating these environmental concerns. The Union of Concerned Scientists (2016) provides a summary of the critical ecological importance of the Brazilian Cer-rado and how soy is a driver for deforestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Veldman, et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>] argue the need to protect non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado. Grecchi, et al. (2013)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>] and Beuchle, et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>] expose how Cerrado land use has changed due to agriculture, and Spera et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>] analyzes how these changes affect water recycling. Rudorff, et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>] geospatially analyze crop dynamics over the last fifteen years to expand under-standings of land cover patterns and changes, and Jepson and Brannstrom (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">66</xref>], and Gusso et al. (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>] explicate economic patterns and influences that lead to high-input agricultural expansion in the biome. Arantes et al. (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>] analyze current carbon and water reserves and indicate what future changes are likely to occur. Batlle-Bayer et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>] review changes in the carbon sink due to land use conversion in the region, while Brack and Bailey (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>] discuss agricultural commodity supply chains (including soy) by tracing the interrelationships of international trade, consumption, and deforestation.</p><p>Other findings, including conservation studies by Car-ranza et al. (2014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>] and Esp´ırito-Santo et al. (2016)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>], are foundational to understanding how ecosystem in-tegrity connects to issues of human security. The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund’s Ecosystem Profile: Cerrado Biodiversity Hotspot (2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] prepared by Sawyer et al., gives a broad, multi-dimensional overview of the biome and the issues, activities and organizations involved in determin-ing its health. Insights presented by authors that compile the articles of the special issue: Soy Production in South America: Globalization and New Agroindustrial Landscapes (2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">73</xref>] published by the Journal of Peasant Studies, and the collected volume Soy, Globalization and Environ-mental Politics in South America (2018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>], both edited by Oliveira and Hecht, provide some of the critical under-pinnings for this paper. Finally, Wendy Wolford connects environmental justice issues to large-scale agriculture and the social impacts of soy in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>].</p>

      <title>7. An overview of soy &amp; its implications for water</title>
      <p>With the aid of chemical fertilizers, the Cerrado is able to produce mega-scale commercial yields of corn, sugarcane, cotton, and above all, soy—the crop that is currently en-abling the production of massive quantities of meat and dairy globally. Approximately 80% of the world’s soy is pro-cessed for animal feed, much of it in Brazil to be sold to export markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>]. Many other global consumer prod-ucts, from processed foods to cosmetics, also exist thanks to a ten-fold growth in the production of Brazilian soy in the last 50 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>] So much of the South American continent has been subjected to agricultural expansion by the GM soy industry that cultivation of the crop has been referred to as a new form of Latin American colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>]. The conversion of native Cerrado into fields of soy has enabled Brazil to become the world’s largest exporter of soy—and for the first time the largest producer, overtaking the US for the 2018 harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>]. Soy accounted for almost 40% of Brazil’s agricultural exports by value in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>], giving large producers significant influence over economic and political decision-making.</p><p>Up to 70% of the Cerrado’s vast tapestry of native plants and trees are connected via a unique and complex root system that has developed over eons and is crucial for eco-logical, carbon, and water security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>]. The magnitude and velocity with which the Cerrado’s native vegetation is being deforested due to agricultural expansion is a major contributor to Brazil’s key emissions sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] and a fun-damental cause of water stress throughout the region due to the changes it catalyzes in hydrological patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>]. The large-scale loss of native vegetation and its replace-ment by shallow root system crops such as soybeans has resulted in rainwater being less able to infiltrate the ground because the deep root system needed to absorb the water and feed the water table is no longer there. This results in stormwater erosion and affects lake bottom sedimentation processes that inhibit surface water from penetrating to the Cerrado’s aquifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>].</p><p>Spera’s remote sensing study (2016), which mapped land-use change across the biome between 2003 and 2013, revealed that cropland agriculture increased from 1.2 to 2.5 million ha during this period, and that 74% was a conse-quence of expansion into previously intact Cerrado vegeta-tion. According to the study, this has led to decreased water recycling via evapotranspiration over each consecutive year during this timeframe, demonstrating that in 2013, Cerrado croplands recycled 3% less (14 km<sup>3</sup>) water than if the land had been covered with native vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>]. Even though evidence suggests that double-cropping can mitigate evapo-transpiration losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>], and some tree cover and wooded lands have been recovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>], overall acute net losses in native vegetation due to growth in agribusiness enterprises in the region means increased competition for water supplies and escalating water conflicts. Between 2011 and 2016, Brazil saw a 150% increase in water conflicts, totaling 172 major water conflicts which affected 44,000 families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_84">84</xref>].</p><p>Deforestation in the biome, notably from soy, has im-paired stream-valley systems due to erosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>] and in-creased streamflow in small catchment areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>], a sce-nario that may eventually lead to a critical reduction in ac-cessible groundwater stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_87">87</xref>]. Further, pesticides have been detected in water catchment areas under intensive agricultural use, with extremely high-peak concentrations exceeding national and European water quality limits in several cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. With the relaxation of riparian require-ments on private properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_88">88</xref>], and the increase of land use expansion and intensification expected to continue, par-ticularly in the northeastern and western regions where less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected, the leaching risk and migration of agrotoxins are expected to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>].</p><p>The most aggressive deforestation is occurring in the northeast region of Matopiba (an area comprising of the Cerrado portions of the Brazilian states of Maranh˜ao, To-cantins, Piau´ı and Bahia). Matopiba is one of the poorest regions in Brazil and the last expanse of the biome that is being converted to large-scale mechanized agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_89">89</xref>]. The conversion has been catalyzed by a development plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_90">90</xref>], devised by Brazil’s Ministry for Agriculture, to advance the large-scale production of soy and other agricultural com-modities for export. Even though land prices in the Cerrado have increased rapidly since 2009, land in Matopiba re-mains less expensive than other areas of the biome, which makes it attractive for agricultural development. In 2014, 16% of soy planted in the Cerrado was planted in Matipoba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>]. The expansion of privatized agribusiness interests is also resulting in excessive deforestation and water pollu-tion, which suggests even more strain will be put on water resources in the coming decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_91">91</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>].

This has implications for hydrol-ogy on both a global scale (due to the effects on climate change) and across the biome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. On a regional scale, remote sensing shows that during the Cerrado’s dry season, evapotranspiration from agricultural land averages 60% less than what occurs from land covered with native vegetation. As cropland continues to devour native vegetation, the de-crease in dry season water recycling may eventually result in delaying the onset of the Cerrado’s wet season, which is responsible for the majority of rains the region receives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>].</p><p>72% of Brazil’s total water consumption in 2010 was used for irrigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_95">95</xref>]—yet only a small fraction (624,000 ha) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_96">96</xref>] of soybean acreage is irrigated, accounting for 12% of the country’s total harvested irrigated crop area for 2006 (last statistics available) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_97">97</xref>]. As agriculture in-tensifies, however, so too does its irrigation needs.

      <title>8. Water: a cycle of diminishing capacity</title>
      <p>The Cerrado supplies water to six of the country’s eight largest watersheds, the whole of the Pantanal, eight of the country’s twelve river basin districts, and three of the world’s largest and oldest aquifers. The Guaran´ı Aquifer is the second largest aquifer in the world. It lies beneath the sovereign territory of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, and has a storage volume of 40,000 km3—enough to supply an estimated 11 billion people for 100 years with 100 liters of water per person per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_101">101</xref>]. 71% of the aquifer (840,000 km<sup>2</sup>) lies underneath 9.8% of Brazilian territory, yet Brazil accounts for approximately 90% of all Guaran´ı water extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_102">102</xref>]. In contrast, a quarter of Uruguay is located above the aquifer, yet it uses less than 5% of what Brazil consumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_103">103</xref>]. The South American epi-center of soybean cultivation occurs in the same quadrant of countries that intersect over the Guaran´ı, with Brazil tak-ing lead as top producer, followed by Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, in a region known as the United Soy Republic. Transboundary tensions around the Guaran´ı Aquifer have seen a regression in cooperation over the last several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_104">104</xref>]. In relation to agriculture, contamination from diffuse sources such as pesticides, and groundwater exploitation that impede the aquifer’s recharge rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_104">104</xref>], may reduce its viable use over the long-term.</p><p>Over-exploitation of the Guaran´ı may eventually result in localized and gradual top-to-bottom depletion that may bring subterranean water levels below what can be feasibly accessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_105">105</xref>]. While the aquifer in its entirety may not be in danger of becoming depleted, oversight of consump-tion is required in order to ensure a continuous, accessible supply, as only a small percentage of rainfall penetrates to replenish it. Over the last several decades, changes in land use above the aquifer as a result of agricultural activity have significantly decreased the amount of rainfall entering the system in some regions. The water required for the production of soy, for example, puts increasing pressure on it as it continues to be over-drafted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_106">106</xref>]. In 2007 alone, Brazil’s soybean exports to just fifteen EU countries contained 11.6 trillion liters (673 km<sup><sub>3</sub></sup>) of virtual water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_107">107</xref>]. If such consumption continues over the coming decades, recharge rates may be reduced to less than half of natural levels in some outcrop areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_103">103</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_105">105</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_108">108</xref>].</p><p>The approximate 50% of the Cerrado that remains cov-ered with native vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_109">109</xref>] is critical to the health of regional hydrology. Deforestation due to agricultural expan-sion is responsible for a significant decrease in evapotran-spiration at a local level, though it does not solely account for all of the recent changes in water balance. Other an-thropic activities, including irrigation and reservoir creation, also modify the water balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Typically, evaporation oc-curs at a rate of 21% in savannahs. Changes in land cover type from savannah to pasture and cropland may directly affect the global water balance, as hotspots of evapotranspi-ration are reduced because of deforestation, consequently shifting the location, intensity and timing of rainfall events, extending dry seasons and altering stream flows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_111">111</xref>].

      <p>Brazil’s climate in the 21st Century can be characterized by multiple, anthopogenically-driven, acute eco-hydorological events, in which the Cerrado plays a critical role. The biome is foundational to much of South America’s water resource dynamics because it distributes fresh water to the largest basins, including the Paran´a, Tocantins, Paraguai and S˜ao Francisco. These watersheds are crucial to the provision of water supply for humans and non-humans, to maintain-ing eco-hydrologic functioning, and to providing water for industry, agriculture and hydroelectric energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>Extreme drought events in southeastern Brazil (2014–2017) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_114">114</xref>], in Amazonia (2005, 2010, 2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_115">115</xref>], and the northeast (2012–2016) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_116">116</xref>] are not random climatic anomalies but are attributable to changes in the water cycle due to deforestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_117">117</xref>], transformations and commodifi-cations of waterscapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_118">118</xref>], and failures in land and water resource management and policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_119">119</xref>]. Declining multi-year rainfall patterns continue to worsen socio-economic-environmental relationships. 2018 saw more than 900 of Brazil’s 5,570 municipalities in a state of water emergency due to drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_120">120</xref>]. The dry weather patterns of the mete-orological drought dominating the Cerrado over time have become a hydrological drought, resulting in agricultural and socio-economic drought that continues to bring instability throughout Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_121">121</xref>].</p><p>In 2014, the Parana´ Basin that supplies the state of S˜ao Paulo with water suffered an extreme drought event[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_114">114</xref>] which catalyzed a series of dramatic chain-link consequences for the mega-city of S˜ao Paulo. The drought, the worst in 80 years, was also linked to climate change caused by deforestation and the drying up of Brazil’s aerial or ‘flying rivers’ that are generated in the Amazon Basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_122">122</xref>]. Impacts were compounded by poor planning and bad man-agement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_123">123</xref>], including a loss of up to 30% of all treated water due to leaks and illegal usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_119">119</xref>]; no recycling pro-gram for domestic water; and failures on the part of water resource planning and management sectors to engineer an interconnected reservoir system that efficiently balances inventories to meet demand without the emergency draining of dams or tapping of aquifer reserves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_119">119</xref>].</p><p>Between 2014-2015, these factors collectively resulted in 40-70% of the 20 million people living in greater metropoli-tan S ˜ao Paulo having their water supply halved and access periodically disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_124">124</xref>]. Many went without tap water for days at a time, while others opted to leave the city [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_125">125</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_126">126</xref>]. Authorities were forced to drill into the Bauru Sandstone di-vision of the Guaranı´ Aquifer System in order to pump small reserves of water into the Cantareira Reservoir System to supply many of the city’s residents with water, possibly compromising the amount of available groundwater over the long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_127">127</xref>]. Diminished hydropower capacity saw public services (including electricity, the Internet, and S˜ao Paulo’s metro system) cut for multi-day periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_125">125</xref>]. The increased financial burden carried by electrical distributors forced them to access more expensive sources of power, such as thermal and gas, and caused the government to take out loans from state-run banks to subsidize distribu-tors’ higher energy expenses, resulting in brownouts and blackouts and up to a 30% rise in consumer energy costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_128">128</xref>]. A lack of available drinking water prompted rainwater hoarding in unsecured containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_129">129</xref>], and periodically spiked incidents of vector-borne diseases such as Zika and Dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_130">130</xref>]. Brazil’s declining zero-to-negative growth in 2015 was estimated to be affected by an additional 1–2%; 36% of all Brazilians faced water supply problems; indus-try and agriculture were impacted; 40 million people faced water rationing; electricity rationing affected regions which account for 60% of the country’s GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_124">124</xref>]; and inflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_131">131</xref>] and food prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_132">132</xref>] rose.</p><p>Water shortages have also affected the mechanics of the S˜ao Francisco River Basin in recent years. The S˜ao Francisco is third largest river in the country and the only major river that starts and finishes in Brazil. Nearly 70%of the water that feeds the S˜ao Francisco River originates in the Cerrado. It is one of the most important river basins in South America, covering 7.5% of Brazilian territory and supplying enough water to irrigate 300,000 ha of agricul-tural land and service 14 million inhabitants in 504 different municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_133">133</xref>]. The S˜ao Francisco River’s waters are sequestered at the north end of the Sobradinho reservoir system in Bahia (the 12th largest reservoir system in the world). From here, waters are used to enable the surround-ing drought-prone region to be agriculturally viable and to feed the S˜ao Francisco River Integration and Transposi-tion mega-projects through a 600km+ series of networked canals that began operating in 2018 to divert 1.4% of S˜ao Francisco River water to temporary rivers in drought-prone arid areas in Northeastern Brazil. The diverted water feeds industry, agriculture and municipality needs in four states (Pernambuco, Para´ıba, Cear´a and Rio Grande do Norte). The government is in the process of privatizing the project, which has massive operating costs (to be met by the states), and which has been plagued by construction cost overruns, corruption scandals, and protests from environmental and civil society organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_134">134</xref>]. </p><p>Before the diversion projects, the S˜ao Francisco River was already losing water at a rate of 3.3 km3 per annum (2002-2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_130">130</xref>]. Levels have been critically depleted for several consecutive years, and in 2014 the river’s headwa-ters dried up completely for the first time in history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_135">135</xref>]. In 2016, the Sobradino reservoir operated at only 18%of capacity, a level almost too low to access.

      <title>10. The overuse of agrotoxins</title>
      <p>The cultivation of GM soy has resulted in the growing con-sumption of a generation of agrotoxins that are increasingly responsible for numerous environmental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_143">143</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_144">144</xref>]. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_146">146</xref>]. In 2003, with the introduction of GM crops into Brazil, the country’s use of agrotoxins increased by more than 200% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>]. This figure continues to rise at an annual rate of approximately 15%, more than double the global rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_147">147</xref>]. Since 2008, Brazil has become one of the largest users of agrotoxins in the world, consuming 20% of the global supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>], with the majority being used on transgenic soy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_148">148</xref>]. Though the use of pesticide on soy is intensifying, soy shows extremely low gains in productivity from its use, displaying a 1:13 percentage point (pp) ratio. In comparison, two other GM crops that account for Brazil’s major pesti-cide consumption—corn and cotton—show an approximate 1:1 pp productivity ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_149">149</xref>]. This demonstrates that soy production is not effectively enhanced from increased pesti-cide use but rather it contributes to the cumulative growth of nation-wide agrotoxin consumption, which is increasing at a rate higher than overall crop productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_149">149</xref>].</p><p>In 2013, Brazilians purchased in excess of $10 billion worth of agrotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_147">147</xref>] prepared almost entirely by just six companies—Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Monsanto, Dow, and Dupont—the same transnational corporations that control all the GM crops grown globally for commercial purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>]. Poor regulatory oversight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_150">150</xref>] around the industry has made Brazil an attractive market for more than 400 types of pesticides that are banned in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_147">147</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_148">148</xref>]. In 2015, Brazil planted 21 predominant crops over 71.2 million hectares. Soy accounted for 42% of the country’s total planted area (32.2 million hectares) and used the most pesticides, accounting for 63% of the total, around 207 million liters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_151">151</xref>]. The most used active ingredient is glyphosate, that accounts for approximately 5.2-+5.5 liters per hectare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_152">152</xref>].</p><p>By 2015, it was estimated that each and every Brazilian was ingesting 7.3 liters of agrotoxins per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_153">153</xref>]. The pri-mary pesticide pathways to surface and groundwater occur through wind drift as a result of aerial spraying, runoff from agricultural fields in areas where riparian vegetation has been depleted, and leaching through soil macropores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. Though drinking water monitoring data is far from compre-hensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_154">154</xref>], some grain-producing areas in the Cerrado [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_155">155</xref>] have detected pesticides in the Guaran´ı aquifer and wells—in concentrations that exceed Brazil’s minimal water quality limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_156">156</xref>]. The absence of controls on well designs and closures may cause some wells to operate as open channels for surface contamination. It is presumed that further contamination is occurring, especially in vulnerable outcrop areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_156">156</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_157">157</xref>].</p><p>The extensive areas of high pesticide consumption are mainly located in the Cerrado [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_151">151</xref>].

In 2006, the Lucas do Rio Verde municipality in Mato Grosso (population 55,000) expe-rienced toxic rains as a result of plantation crop fumigation with Paraquat, a herbicide used in the drying of soy for harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>]. Subsequent health studies conducted be-tween 2007 and 2010 in the same municipality discovered contamination in 83% of drinking water supplies in drinking water wells, and in two lagoons, as well as in the blood of toads (congenital malformations in these toads were found to be four times more prevalent than those observed in a control lagoon). Glyphosate, pyrethroids, and organochlo-rines were found in the urine and blood of 88% of teachers sampled in the region’s municipal schools, and in 100% of samples of women’s breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_145">145</xref>].</p><p>Nationwide health indicators show a positive correlation between the consumption of pesticides, fetal malforma-tion, and chronic childhood cancer in areas predominantly planted with soybeans, corn and sugarcane crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_151">151</xref>], with the intensity of agricultural production and pesticide use proportional to sites of environmental pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_159">159</xref>]. 4,003 cases of agricultural pesticide poisoning, or almost 11 a day, were reported nationwide in 2017, including 148 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_160">160</xref>]. The level of glyphosate present in GM soy has been found to be 19,500 times higher than the level found to have estrogenic effects on breast cancer cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_161">161</xref>], a level even Monsanto admits is “extreme” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_162">162</xref>]. These issues are part of a landscape of environmental violence that is structured by a meagerly enforced legal regulatory framework that continues to be both shaped and threatened by Brazil’s powerful agricultural lobby [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_147">147</xref>].</p><p>One of many recent attempts to relax agrotoxin regula-tions came in June 2018, through a special committee that approved a report recommending the adoption of what has come to be known as the Poison Bill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_163">163</xref>]. The agrotoxin regulatory process is currently overseen by the Ministries of Agriculture, Health and the Environment, however if the bill is passed into law, it will transfer oversight directly to the Ministry of Agriculture. It will also lift bans on agrotoxins that are currently prohibited and reduce the testing period for newly introduced pesticides to two years (from five), whereupon registration could be automatically authorized. The bill also proposes that products containing teratogenic, carcinogenic or mutagenic properties should be analyzed only if they are considered dangerous to human health, but Brazilian institutions lack the resources to conduct such analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_164">164</xref>].</p><p>Even though the external costs of pesticide usage—to the environment and to human health—are being brought into questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], long-standing institutions such as Brazil’s National Council for Food and Nutrition Security are being abolished (the Council was eliminated on the first day Jair Bolsonaro took presidential office) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_165">165</xref>]. In January 2019, 40 new products containing pesticides, in-cluding 28 new registrations of pesticides as their primary ingredient were approved for sale (12 were approved within a week of Bolsonaro taking office).</p><p>Decades ago, Rachel Carson identified the victims of pesticide poisoning as those who “assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_166">166</xref>]. This is certainly true in Brazil, in a scenario that may be most tersely character-ized as a measure of what Michael Watts describes as the “violent geographies of fast capitalism” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_167">167</xref>]. Still, pesticide use and impact remain only part of any sustainability or environmental justice equation. Eco-responsibility means different things to different experts and different stakehold-ers. Pesticide levels, productivity per acre, water usage and quality, and an array of other scientifically measurable and qualitative factors are part of complex, value-based ideolo-gies that build narratives to constitute or defend dialectic perspectives on what sustainable agriculture means and how it can be achieved.</p>

          <p>With the introduction of Bolsonaro’s policies, agribusiness is set to be fast-tracked with even fewer environmental con-straints. Soybeans have historically played a central role in advancing transnational agribusiness in Brazil. State-led colonization projects such as Prodecer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_209">209</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_210">210</xref>]; a world food crisis and the 2008 financial crisis that was connected to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_211">211</xref>] which consolidated food security with financial returns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_212">212</xref>]; and the market liberalization and privatization gains made during the commodity boom 2007–2014, brought a swell of private/foreign capital to develop global supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_213">213</xref>].</p>
          <p>Global trade liberalization under the WTO has stimu-lated trade links between Brazil and China and Brazil and Europe. China’s liberalization of soybean imports has made it the world’s largest importer of soybeans—with more than half coming from Brazil. The extraordinary growth in the industry has been magnified by the large-scale replacement of alternative forms of edible vegetable oils and meal for animal feed with soy products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_214">214</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_215">215</xref>]. With record yields and profits and the trade war between the US and China, Brazil is on track to become an even larger soy exporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_216">216</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_217">217</xref>]. Much of the challenge is being met by expand-ing river transportation infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_218">218</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_219">219</xref>], enabled by the support of various public and private Dutch interests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_220">220</xref>], to make it viable to get soybeans to port through a northern corridor. Low-interest, often-subsidized credit lines, available through national development banks and subsidized availability of productive technologies, have also made soy extremely profitable and fueled both its expansion and intensification.</p><p>Moving forward, development will remain dependent on financialization, subsidization, access to cheap land, lax restrictions on foreign ownership, construction of new infrastructure (highways, river channels and ports), tech-nological advancements (fertilizers, pesticides, and agri-mechanization processes), deforestation, intensification and water diversion. The socio-environmental costs are huge. The northern corridor is expected to create massive socio-ecological disruptions by increasing deforestation, logging, environmental pollution, foreign land occupation and violence between local and Indigenous populations and large landowners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_220">220</xref>]. Similarly, soy expansion in Matopiba has resulted in mass dispossession, where the appropriation of public lands for soy cultivation have been legitimized through sophisticated forms of territorial transfer and control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>]. Here soy cultivation increased by 253%from 2000 to 2014, to cover 3.4 million hectares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Accord-ing to a 2018 policy briefing analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_221">221</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_222">222</xref>], between 2009 and 2013, 70% of direct soy deforestation in the Cer-rado took place in just fifteen municipalities of the Matopiba region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_223">223</xref>]. Between 57% and 90% of this soy is produced for the export market and has direct and indirect impacts on ecosystem services, especially water provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_221">221</xref>].</p><p>Brazil’s 2013 irrigation law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_224">224</xref>] is key in incentivizing public and private irrigation projects that facilitate intensification and expansion. The law follows a 2009 recommendation by the World Bank that claims production growth will be achieved by:</p><p>“...providing investors with greater flexibility, since, to a greater or lesser extent, they would allow for (i) the consoli-dation of the irrigation service through agricultural occupa-tion within one large company or a vertical consortium of companies; or (ii) free negotiation, under a market scheme, between the irrigation service provider and agricultural pro-ducers. This freedom could be perceived by investors as an indicator of lower risk, since these investors would have con-trol over the selection of their partners, consortium members, and contracted parties, free from new bidding procedures. Guarantees for payments, tariffs (or prices), and implementation or occupation terms would be freely negotiated by the parties, within their sphere of private negotiation” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_225">225</xref>].</p><p>Cerrado regions with a high concentration of irrigated areas are dangerously reducing water supplies and gener-ating conflicts for those that live in basin areas constantly under threat from water overuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_226">226</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_227">227</xref>]. Estimated to be 3.5 times more productive than rain-fed agriculture, ir-rigation allows estimated economic gains up to seven- or eight-fold greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_228">228</xref>]. However, the growth of intensifi-cation facilitated by irrigation also brings water insecurity with it. Though current soy output in Mato Grosso (which has been aggressively deforested and now produces pri-marily through intensification) still relies almost exclusively on rain-fed systems, irrigated systems will nonetheless play an important role moving forward. With irrigation, soybeans can be planted one month earlier and irrigated until the start of the wet season, allowing for an earlier harvest and, potentially, a fully irrigated dry season crop. Increasing irri-gation not only increases annual water vapor transfer to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration at the expense of surface and groundwater, it also requires expanding infras-tructure to facilitate it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_229">229</xref>].</p><p>Intensified production of GM soy, which made up 96% of soy cultivated in Brazil in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_230">230</xref>], together with an irrigated dry season crop and heavy agrotoxin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_231">231</xref>], reinforces a pro-growth perception that is tied to a market logic which ratio-nalizes negative socio-environmental impacts and trade-offs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_232">232</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_233">233</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_234">234</xref>] and raises conservation costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_232">232</xref>].</p><p>Approximately 30% of all lands available for crop expan-sion are located in Latin America and by 2050 approximately 80% of intensified production worldwide is expected to rely on irrigated agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_235">235</xref>]. Thus, South America’s water supply paradox is apt to become more pronounced with calculations suggesting that 60% of all accessible blue water (freshwater) would have to be appropriated for agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_235">235</xref>] to meet the projected demands of intensification globally—an unsus-tainable proposition that will increase pressure on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and traditional cultures and livelihood systems that struggle to survive on already-stressed common property (land, water, forests and fishing).</p><p>Much socio-ecological security in Brazil, however, is ul-timately determined by the green water stored in the soils of the Cerrado. Its abundance or scarcity and the linkages between green and blue water flows are inextricably tied to a healthy ecology and water cycle. As regional hydrol-ogy patterns are altered, and climate change accelerates, gradual changes in political ecologies will be forced to rec-oncile the differences between institutional and corporate interests and the interdependencies between economic and environmental realities. The already high social costs will be higher and will amplify already long-standing conflicts with established agribusiness practices.</p>

      <title>12. A difficult path forward</title>
      <p>There is an accepted philosophical position in contemporary society whereby if an institutional agent has the capacity, power, and resources to aid in solving a problem, they have a responsibility to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_236">236</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_237">237</xref>]. However, ethical imper-atives are based on moral and political complexities that require applying a series of judgements, legal or otherwise, that in practical usage are often in dialectic opposition to one another—played out in various assemblages of con-tradictory regulatory and trade frameworks at sub-national, national and international levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_238">238</xref>].</p><p>Environmental ethics posit that the intrinsic value of nat-ural resources and environmental costs must be included in the evaluation of capital investments in development and sector policy, yet these evaluations almost exclusively occur through cost-benefit analyses in which minimizing economic cost typically remains the central, controlling, and diluting measure for environmental threat assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_239">239</xref>]. The ethical responsibilities relating to climate change may be more difficult to ignore in coming decades because of the interrelated societal consequentialism that is compounding impacts on multiple simultaneous levels. These impacts are already reconceptualizing how responsibilities can be assigned to address accelerating environmental problems.</p><p>Agribusiness on the Cerrado comes at the expense of biotic, aquatic, traditional, and Indigenous life, all of which have been relegated to surviving in conservation fragments interspersed between private lands and ultimately threat-ened by extinction. Such a dilemma was theorized decades ago by Aldo Leopold in his seminal essay The Land Ethic (1949). Leopold contended that government conservation efforts would eventually be crippled by an unbalanced sys-tem based solely on economic self-interest, which would ignore (to the point of elimination) land community elements that lack commercial value but that are intrinsic to healthy function. He further queried that if ethical obligations are not materially assigned to the private landowner, who would carry the “eventual ramifications”? [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_240">240</xref>] Climate change is emerging as a peripheral argument that may be central to dispensing such responsibility.</p><p>By 2017, there were more than 1,200 climate change or climate change-relevant laws in place worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_241">241</xref>]. Ex-isting national and international laws cover a large portion of the globe, however, there remains a need to strengthen and enforce legislation and fill gaps in existent laws. Even with climate change as a peripheral issue (in 77% of suits, climate change is a partial or motivating argument) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_241">241</xref>], the judiciary is increasingly confronted by disputes involving climate change-related issues. Such cases aimed at estab-lishing regulatory protections are becoming more frequent.</p><p>Climate change is yet to be used as a central strategy to litigate against agribusiness-related GHG contributions, however, as a peripheral argument they are emerging. A 2018 lawsuit was lodged by an environmental advocacy group against the German government for its complicity in failing to curb nitrates from seeping into groundwater, mostly as the result of factory farming operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_242">242</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_243">243</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_244">244</xref>]. The strategy aims to force an emissions cap on methane production, and thus reduce overall farm sizes. These sorts of actions could, theoretically, become instrumental in altering the course of livestock feed production, transportation and imports. Thus, the links connecting industrial farming become vulnerable as they are exposed to climate change litigation, if only as a peripheral argument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_245">245</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_246">246</xref>].</p><p>Most successful climate change litigation decisions tend to favor pro-regulatory positions involving energy efficiency or renewable energy technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_247">247</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_248">248</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_249">249</xref>]. Using renew-able energy to replace fuels made from cash crops such as soy are already taking the form of pro-regulatory rec-ommendations that are more frequently finding their way into agriculture and energy policy recommendations and blueprints globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_250">250</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_251">251</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_252">252</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_253">253</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_254">254</xref>]. These shifts in the energy landscape may eventually have ramifications for interna-tional commodity trading. Incorporating climate change mitigation measures into crop insurance and conservation compliance programs, and building emissions reduction and carbon sequestration caps into agriculture bills may also be a method for government to assign corporate responsibility.</p><p>Other internationally spearheaded conservation efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_255">255</xref>] are underway to create legal recognition of the rights of nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_256">256</xref>] and governmental duties of care. Constitu-tional amendments and bills that champion these concepts have been adopted in Mexico City [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_257">257</xref>] and are tabled in Argentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_258">258</xref>] and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_259">259</xref>]. New Zealand has im-bued a number of its rivers and forests with personhood rights, India has declared personhood rights for the Ganges River, and a 2018 ruling by the Columbian Supreme Court imbued sovereign Amazon forest with personhood right and declared that the federal government has a resulting duty to protect it. Going further, Bolivia and Ecuador have passed legislation granting all nature equal rights to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_260">260</xref>]. Among these jurisdictions that have developed concepts of environmental personhood, applications and understand-ings of it are diverse.</p><p>As the concept becomes more widely applied, envi-ronmental personhood may be the next line of attack for redressing environmental protection policies that arguably fail in their care of duty. The concept could prove useful for another challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_261">261</xref>] to Brazil’s revised 2012 Forest Code—a set of controversial laws that regulate land use and management on private properties. It is of particular im-portance because 76% of rural landholdings in Brazil exist on private land and 80% of regions converted to soybean plantations have occurred in areas that are permitted by the FC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_262">262</xref>], much of it by removing native vegetation from Cer-rado lands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].

Brazil has no judicial interpretation of the public trust doctrine but has constitutional provisions (including articles 5, 20, 23, 24, 225) that embrace its prin-ciples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_267">267</xref>], which could be legally applied to protect the Cerrado irrespective of its commercial value.</p><p>Under international law, the Precautionary Principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_268">268</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_269">269</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_270">270</xref>] may be used to stop the use of technological enhancements for short-term economic gains at the ex-pense of future generations if environmental damage by one nation state causes serious and irreversible conse-quences to another. The principle is often cited in official documents pertaining to international environmental com-mitments and may be useful to consider in regard to issues pertaining to Brazil’s disproportionate over-drafting of the Guaran´ı Aquifer, or applied to slow land use conversion that can be definitively linked to hydrology changes in neighboring nation states, as crop production is directly achieved through the aid of technological enhancements such as GM production methods enabled by technical in-vestment and financing sectors. This argument may also, theoretically, be invoked to block the uptake of the ‘Cer-rado Miracle’ in cases such as Mozambique’s controversial ProSavana initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_271">271</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_272">272</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_273">273</xref>].</p><p>Over the last decade, chemical pesticide manufacturing industries have increasingly become a target of litigation.

Correlating human rights protections with climate change mitigation and impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_292">292</xref>] may prove useful as an emerg-ing strategy for movements such as the MST to extend their power and redress unjust laws and labor practices, including those that are equated with slavery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_293">293</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_294">294</xref>].</p><p>Most commonly, slave labor in Brazil is used to clear land for agriculture. For example, in the soy frontier of Mato Grosso and Par´a, for the years 2003 and 2004, almost 8,700 incidences of slavery were reported by government [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_295">295</xref>]. To counter this, initiatives could legally organize around the concept of a ‘just transitions law’ to realize a lower carbon economy by bringing together environmental and labor laws in approaches that link worker-based hu-man trafficking and rights organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_296">296</xref>] with climate change legislation, sustainability practices, and Indigenous and small farmer land tenure security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_297">297</xref>]. As yet, such policies remain under-explored in legal literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_298">298</xref>] but may over time coalesce to bring pressure to agribusiness producers, multinational buyers, and mega-supermarket chains to adhere to better labor, sustainable production, and transparency practices.</p><p>Other initiatives, though presenting their own integrity issues, are a step toward advancing sustainability in multi-directional supply chains. These include fair trade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_299">299</xref>] and organic certification practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_300">300</xref>], Indigenous food production systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_301">301</xref>] and carbon security initiatives. In 2018, Netherlands-based Louis Dreyfus Company an-nounced it will become the first major commodity trader to stop buying soy from newly deforested land specifically in the Cerrado [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_302">302</xref>]. However, there are few transparent methods with which to trace the integrity of supply chains. For example, major associations like the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) certify using a book and claim chain of custody system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_303">303</xref>] that offers little transparency.</p><p>Another sector gaining traction is the sustainable, re-sponsible and impact (SRI) investment sector, a growing area which has received an influx of money since the Paris Climate Agreement. The capacity of SRI lies in both divest-ment and reinvestment. Though reinvestments are vulnera-ble to greenwashing—for example, consider the criticisms levelled at the RTRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_304">304</xref>]—the SRI sector is an indicator of the public’s desire to support sustainability goals.</p><p>Reallocation of capital, together with changing public attitude is, however, becoming more influential in reforming agriculture and fighting climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_305">305</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_306">306</xref>]. For ex-ample, at the 2014 UN Climate Summit, Norway, Germany and the UK pledged to support public procurement policies for sustainably sourced products like soy and to encour-age deforestation-free supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_307">307</xref>], and Norway’s action plan presented by parliament in 2016 argued the government need exercise due care for the protection of biodiversity in its global pension fund investments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_308">308</xref>].</p><p>What matters with these sorts of commitments is policy longevity. For example, in 2015, Norway paid $1 billion to Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_309">309</xref>] for fulfilling a 2008 agreement between the two countries to prevent deforestation. At the time, the deal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_310">310</xref>] resulted in the largest global emissions cut over the lifespan of the agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_311">311</xref>]. However the victory was short-lived, and came at the expense of Cerrado lands and waters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_302">302</xref>]. This scenario is useful to examine for two reasons. Firstly, with deforestation again soaring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_312">312</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_313">313</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_314">314</xref>], this scenario illustrates how Brazil leverages its sovereign natural resources for monetary gain. Secondly, international attention has always concentrated on saving the iconic Amazon rainforest, whereas the largely unknown Cerrado suffers from an image problem that doesn’t represent the popular vision of a carbon sink or priority conservation area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_315">315</xref>]. Though it’s possible that the Cerrado’s public profile has been marginally raised through the recently publicized ‘Cerrado Manifesto’, there is no evidence to suggest that this market pledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_316">316</xref>] is anything more than corporate greenwashing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_317">317</xref>].</p><p>One measure which could prove useful as an ethical evaluation metric is virtual water. Brazil is a sizeable ex-porter of virtual water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_318">318</xref>]. Though the water footprint of crop production for export varies greatly between regions in Brazil, the concept could be used to establish new re-sponsibility guidelines. Industrial animal farming (and its relationship to imported feed) is the most water-intensive and water polluting form of meat production, therefore, cal-culating the virtual water footprints of nations by including the impact of livestock feed imports might be another av-enue through which to introduce a resource consumption cap. Additionally, if large consumers such as China and the EU withdrew their oilseed commitments under the current WTO Agreement on Agriculture, they could potentially be freed up to establish domestic production of more varied livestock feeds (such as the EU produced in the 1990s) without policy limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_319">319</xref>].</p><p>There is an emerging view that replicable models of sustainable management of tropical forested lands may be found within the knowledge systems of contemporary Indige-nous peoples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_320">320</xref>]. Indigenous knowledge is increasingly being recognized as an important source of knowledge in regard to climate change and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_99">99</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_321">321</xref>]. This sug-gests that climate change is emerging as a battleground strategy that may also be used to strengthen Indigenous rights and protections. Indigenous land management sys-tems are increasingly considered a legitimate right of Indige-nous people, and their information and knowledge systems for managing climate change are becoming progressively more valued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_322">322</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_323">323</xref>]. In Brazil, a 37-year analysis deter-mined that Indigenous land management techniques of the Xavante were responsible for rebuilding ecological integrity and sustaining vegetation recovery in Cerrado regions that had been deforested by agribusiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_324">324</xref>]. Several Indige-nous initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_325">325</xref>] are active in combating issues associ-ated with mono-cropping—including deforestation, biodiver-sity loss, water pollution, and the erosion of rights. These movements may be further aided by the concept of intergen-erational equity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_326">326</xref>] that is embedded in modern interna-tional environmental law. Legal guidelines established by the World Heritage Convention also define a State’s obliga-tion to protect and conserve cultural and natural heritage for future generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_327">327</xref>]. The International Union for Conser-vation of Nature Environmental Law Centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_255">255</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_328">328</xref>] has developed a body of conservation tools and resources for establishing and strengthening this legal framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_329">329</xref>].</p><p>Biodiversity conservation, recognized as crucial for miti-gating climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_330">330</xref>], is beginning to receive renewed attention. At the 2018 UN Conference on Biodiversity, a coalition of Indigenous groups from across Latin America called for the creation of the world’s largest protected area to stretch from Mexico through Brazil. Another legal proposi-tion has proposed extending the country’s soy moratorium in the Amazon to include the Cerrado region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_331">331</xref>]. The pro-posal would prohibit providing credit or buying soybeans from producers who grow in deforested areas. Long-standing con-stitutional amendments bills such as PEC 115/95 and PEC 504/2010 also propose the Cerrado be considered national heritage. It is improbable that any of these measures will be adopted anytime soon by congress, and with Bolsonaro leading Brazil it is imperative that new strategies proposing systemic environmental protections be pushed.</p><p>Actions that confront climate change may be rooted in ethical issues of responsibility, yet they present a direct threat to the fundamental values of neoliberal capitalism. As such, they stand facing the “perfect moral storm” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_332">332</xref>]—confronted by political philosophies that obfuscate science, fail to rec-ognize the value of non-human life, prioritize the commodity value of nature, and operate in climates of corruption and un-der the judicial auspices of business as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_237">237</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_333">333</xref>]. Still, in the near future, agribusiness may be challenged by what oil corporations are dealing with now—where municipal- and state-level legal efforts, sustained activism, and an evolution in communications campaigning are bringing more pressure to bear on industry’s role in climate change.</p><p>Brazil’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), pledged at the Paris Climate Conference, focused on the agricultural sector’s commitments to mitigate global warming, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_334">334</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_335">335</xref>] yet achievements fall below stated targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_336">336</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_337">337</xref>]. Climate change mitigation protocols exist for de-signing, assessing and reporting national and sub-national goals in relation to reducing agriculture’s GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_338">338</xref>], and in some countries, climate change litigation has served as a successful strategy with which to enforce targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_241">241</xref>]. Brazil may, theoretically, be challenged to uphold its international pledges through the constitutional principle of sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_339">339</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_340">340</xref>] in accordance with the Na-tional Policy for Climate Change (NPCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_341">341</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_342">342</xref>]. However, the manipulation of data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_336">336</xref>], the abandonment of defor-estation control policies, President Jair Bolsonaro’s threat to withdraw from the Climate Paris Accord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_343">343</xref>], and weighted political support for predatory agricultural practices have de-railed Brazil’s contribution to a &gt;2℃ world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_344">344</xref>].</p><p>Environmental protection measures can be circumvented through loopholes in forestry cover mandates and emis-sions trade-offs, codes, and tax incentive schemes such as Brazil’s Payment for Environmental Services, Environmental Reserve Quotas, Private Natural Heritage Reserves, the For-est Code (FC), the Ecological Value Added Tax, or the Low Carbon Agriculture (ABC) program. In some cases, these schemes are already used to manipulate forest cover quotas by preserving vegetation fragments where alternative use value is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_345">345</xref>] to enable private deforestation to legally occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_346">346</xref>], or to support measures that promote business-as-usual approaches to farming. For example, the National Policy on Integration of Farming, Livestock and Forestry law[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_347">347</xref>], which seeks to mitigate deforestation, is managed un-der the ABC program. The ABC is problematic because early on its policies were relaxed to allow farmers and ranchers to use ABC credit lines to purchase cattle, remove tree stumps from recently deforested lands, and increase the number of cattle that ranchers can graze per hectare. Thus, ABC may lead to further deforestation in remote and vegetated areas through incentivizing predatory land speculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_348">348</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_349">349</xref>]. In another case, environmental protections were quashed through a decision by the Supreme Court to overrule a munic-ipal regulation that had banned fire as a sugarcane harvest-ing method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_342">342</xref>]. These examples underscore that Brazil’s environmental protections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_350">350</xref>] are frequently undermined by agribusiness interests, corruption, and violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_351">351</xref>].</p><p>Brazil is the most threatening place in the world to ad-vocate for territorial and environmental rights. Between 2002 and 2013, at least 448 environmentalists were killed throughout the country, a number which equals approxi-mately half of all environmentalists murdered globally dur-ing the same period. Around 40% of those were Indigenous peoples involved in disputes over natural resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_352">352</xref>]. In 2016, Brazil again ranked first in deaths over land rights disputes and the protection of the environment, holding the position for the 14th consecutive year, with 49 recorded deaths for 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_353">353</xref>]. In the time period since 2000, about a million families have been threatened by agribusiness conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_354">354</xref>]. With the political intolerance and violent threats continually being levelled at Brazil’s Indigenous and landless populations, and what essentially amounts to the elimination of Brazil’s Ministry for the Environment, multi-pronged, ethics-based legal pressure is one of the few avenues that remain open as a viable means of fighting for the environmental protection of the Cerrado and its peoples.</p>

      <title>13. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This paper has reviewed the ecological and hydrological importance of the Cerrado and explicated how the biome is at risk due to massive land-use change produced by large-scale, mechanized soy production and other forms of agribusiness that drives deforestation on an immense scale. It describes how this has changed hydrological patterns and threatens water security in key ways. It has illustrated a po-litical ecology at a national level that engineers agricultural policies to disproportionately favor large-scale landholders at the expense of environmental integrity and human se-curity. It considers social and economic ramifications that trace back to changes in water resources and rainfall pat-terns. It exposes how the market and state act in concert to channel wealth through a globalized agribusiness culture, and finally, suggests considering a pathway forward that confronts the challenges presented by the ‘perfect storm’ of oligarchical political control and climate change, which threaten sustainability as never before.</p><p>Brazil is projected to experience the largest global in-crease in agricultural production over the next four decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_355">355</xref>]. It is unclear how simultaneous changes in the Cer-rado’s native vegetation structure, precipitation patterns, and climate change will interact to affect land and water re-sources over time as a result of the impact of soy and other large-scale agribusiness enterprises. Evidence suggests that reduced deforestation and increased agricultural pro-duction can occur simultaneously in Brazil’s frontier region, but that this is contingent on policies that promote inten-sification on already-cleared lands while restricting defor-estation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_356">356</xref>]. It is doubtful, however, that government- and industry-led policies will control deforestation as the market begins to favor another boom in expansion. The country may be able to meet demands for increased crop acreage through 2040 by intensification, however it is unlikely this will be achieved without further disruption to rainfall pat-terns or ecological stability. With Brazil holding 12-16% of all freshwater reserves globally, protecting water integrity must be considered a matter of urgent national security, one that must be recognized as a complex fabric of inter-related causes, vulnerability, and impacts associated with globalization and Brazil’s agribusiness industry.</p>
