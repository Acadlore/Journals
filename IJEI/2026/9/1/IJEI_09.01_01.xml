      <abstract><p>Unplanned urban expansion poses significant challenges to sustainable territorial development in intermediate cities. This study analyzes the dynamics of urban expansion and land use change in the city of Cajamarca (Peru) during the period 1986−2040, integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and CA-Markov prediction models. Landsat satellite images from 1986, 2004 and 2022, classified by Random Forest (RF), were used to generate thematic maps and evaluate their accuracy. Subsequently, a spatial simulation model was implemented to project urban expansion to 2040. The results indicate an increase in the urban area from 789.68 hectares to 5,768.19 hectares, while forests and crops also changed. The driving factors for this expansion include rural-urban migration, the availability of services, and real estate development. Projections highlight growth toward the east, southeast, and south of the city. This approach provides strategic inputs for sustainable urban planning and effective land management in transforming Andean cities.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>More than 50% of urban growth, or urban expansion, results from the interaction of global economic, social, and environmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Urban growth depends on demographic changes such as immigration, migration from rural areas to the city and population growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Soil, water, and the environment have been affected by unplanned urban expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], impacting agricultural areas, forests, and sustainable urban development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the technical-scientific analysis of these areas is very important to better understand current and future urban growth patterns and trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Accurate, consistent, and updated information on urbanization trends is important for (i) the formulation of urban development plans and (ii) the definition of urban and rural area boundaries in order to ensure sustainable land use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. For this purpose, land use and land cover change (LULC) maps are used to help understand the dynamics and driving sources of future changes that cities must face [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. These maps are generated using tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing. In addition, various geospatial and statistical models for urban prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>Urban prediction models utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Cellular Automata (CA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], Markov Chains (MC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], CA-MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] and CA-logistic regression (LR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. These models incorporate thematic layers such as LULC, elevation, shadow, slope, distance to roads, and rivers, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Urban growth predictions have been applied in various countries, including Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], Germany, India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] and Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Continents such as the Americas and Europe have experienced urban growth processes in recent years, driven by population and economic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Asia, in particular, is undergoing accelerated growth, with China exhibiting the highest rate of urban expansion, which threatens environmental quality and socioeconomic sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. Meanwhile, in South America, countries face challenges related to urban growth, which exerts pressure on agriculture, water resources, fertilization, and labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Peru has experienced urban growth in its main cities such as Lima, Callao, Arequipa, Trujillo, Piura and Huancayo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. However, no studies have yet been reported on the analysis of land-use expansion and dynamics in high Andean areas of northern Peru using tools such as cloud computing and predictive models, which could help to better understand these changes.</p><p>The city of Cajamarca, located in the northern Peruvian Andes, is not only a contemporary urban center but also a site of great historical significance. It played a pivotal role during the Inca period and within the broader context of the Tahuantinsuyo empire. Over the past 30 years, Cajamarca has experienced significant urbanization, driven by the expansion of built-up areas and mining activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>].</p><p>Despite the extensive use of CA-Markov models globally, their application remains limited in intermediate Andean cities of South America. This study represents one of the first attempts to integrate GIS, cloud-based remote sensing, and CA-Markov modeling in Cajamarca. Our approach addresses this gap by offering a replicable method for predicting urban expansion in similar Andean settings, which remain understudied. Therefore, evaluating the urban growth dynamics of this city using GIS for the period 1986−2040 is essential to understanding how a city rooted in the legacy of the Incas is transforming under modern development pressures.</p>

              <p>To minimize the influence of atmospheric interference, cloud and cloud-shadow masks were applied using the Quality Assessment (QA) band provided in the Landsat surface reflectance datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. A combination of the Fmask algorithm and manual thresholding techniques was used to further remove residual cloud effects. Additionally, only scenes with less than 30% cloud coverage were selected, and composite mosaics were generated for each year using the median reflectance to reduce noise. Following this, corrections for clouds and cloud shadows were applied, resulting in high-quality annual mosaics. Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 bands were selected as predictor variables for supervised classification. These calibrated spectral bands were then combined to create multiband images for each year of analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Additionally, spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) were calculated. Topographic variables, including DEM, slope and aspect, were also incorporated into the analysis.</p>

The training areas were uploaded to GEE, and then Random Forest (RF) supervised classification was applied to generate a single map for each year of analysis (1986, 2004 and 2022) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. To improve the classifications, a spatial filter was applied to remove noise from the classified images.

            <title>2.5. Predicting urban growth using a simulation model to 2040</title>
          
          <p>The future prediction of urban growth was carried out using dynamic models that integrate MC-CA methodologies to model and visualize urban expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. The CA model was applied to perform future predictions using IDRISI Taiga software. The prediction was based on two types of variables: the classified maps obtained from Landsat data (for two specific periods, 2004 and 2022) and independent variables including: i) distance to roads, ii) distance to rivers, iii) distance to the population center, iv) elevation, and v) slope, which were used to generate the transition potential matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. Once the potential matrix was obtained, the CA model was applied to simulate the future urban growth map for the year 2040. Additionally, to validate the model’s accuracy by comparing the simulated maps with those obtained (from Landsat data) for the same year in the study area. </p>

            <title>2.6. Data analysis</title>
          
          <p>The thematic accuracy of the generated maps was determined in three steps: calculating the number of reference areas, sampling design and data processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. The number of reference areas was calculated using Cochran’s Eq. (2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] for each class of the generated maps (1986, 2004 and 2022). For each class, randomly distributed points were obtained.</p>

Subsequently, metrics were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Thus, UA was calculated, corresponding to errors of commission or exclusion (from the user's perspective), while producer accuracy (PA) addressed errors omission or inclusion (according to the map maker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. Additionally, overall accuracy (OA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>] andthe Kappa coefficient ($k$) were calculated (Eq. (3)).</p>

          <p>Urban growth within a city can be attributed to a variety of interacting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>]. Specifically, the urban growth factors identified in the city of Cajamarca are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, relating to the region and the specific context of the city, as described below:</p><p>(a) Demographic growth: Associated with the increase in population driven by demand for housing, employment, services, and urban activities overall.</p><p>(b) Migration: Population growth spurred by demand of individuals seeking housing, employment, and various urban opportunities.</p><p>(c) Economic development: Employment opportunities and the development of economic sectors, such as industry, commerce, and services, attract people to the city in search of work and improved living conditions.</p><p>(d) Infrastructure and services: The availability of robust infrastructure, including roads, public transportation, health services, education (both public and private universities), and other amenities, contributes to the city’s appeal as a place to live.</p><p>(e) Real estate investment and development: Investments in residential and commercial real estate projects drive urban growth by creating new housing options and business spaces.</p><p>(f) Education: The presence of quality educational institutions attracts students and professionals, generating significant growth in the urban population.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>LULC change is related to population growth and the development of anthropogenic activities. The evaluation of the dynamics of urban expansion in Cajamarca using GIS techniques over the 54 years of analysis allowed us to identify important changes. The increase in UA, PC and F is evident from the reduction of SG. Urban growth in Cajamarca is substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], creating a vast and fragmented territory similar to other Peruvian cities such as Lima, Callao, Arequipa, Trujillo, Piura, and Huancayo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. This often contributes to environmental and social deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>]. Despite this, urban areas represent only 2% of the world's surface while housing more than 55% of the population living in cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to plan the development of cities sustainably that will reduce environmental impacts and improve the inhabitants' quality of life.</p><p>Multiple physical, socioeconomic and environmental factors have been identified as promoting urban growth in Cajamarca. These include population growth, migration, availability of basic services such as electricity, water, sewage, education, health, and investments that cause people to migrate from rural areas to urban areas. These factors often improve people's living conditions; however, in other cases, they can negatively impact the environment (e.g., solid waste dumps, environmental pollution, loss of biodiversity, conversion of forest and crops to urban areas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to implement adequate urban planning in order to manage urban development and human activities within the physical environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>], addressing land use policy alternatives, complying with regulations, and coordinating with stakeholders at different administrative decision-making levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>].</p><p>The study identified five LULC classes: forest, grassland and shrubland, pasture and crops, urban areas, and water. In percentage terms, the shrubland and grassland class will represent the largest area (41.72%), followed by urban area (24.13%), pasture and crops (19.76%), forest (14.24%) and water (0.16%) of the study area by 2040. Likewise, at the period level of analysis, there is a decrease in the SG class and an increase in the forest, pasture and crops and urban area classes. The increase in the forest class is likely related to reforestation projects similar to Granja Porcón, while the increase in the pasture and crops class is closely related to the installation of new agricultural and pasture plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>].</p><p>Urban growth in the city of Cajamarca shows an upward trend from 798.68 ha (3.34%) to 5,768.19 ha (24.13%) from 1986 to 2040, respectively. Urban growth patterns are consistent with Canelo &amp;amp; Moscoso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>], who demonstrate that the city’s southward expansion has been primarily driven by the pressure of the informal land market, influenced by mining investment and limited action by authorities.</p><p>The application of tools such as GIS and GEE allowed the detection of LULC changes and the prediction of land use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">55</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">56</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>]. The possible urban expansion areas in Cajamarca will be located to the northeast, southeast and south of the city, which could be conditioned with the creation of new human settlements and private housing developments promoted by real estate agencies influencing urban growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>]. However, the GEE platform may have some limitations when working on small areas, such as resolution, which does not allow a detailed analysis of land cover. Additionally, data collected by satellites may contain more noise and errors, potentially affecting the accuracy of analyses; the availability of historical data and the presence of clouds may also limit the development of investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>]. Finally, this study reports on the possible urban expansion zones in Cajamarca, which can be considered as an input for institutions involved in planning and urban development framed within sustainable development and environmental conservation.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study evaluated the dynamics of urban growth in the city of Cajamarca using GIS techniques and cloud-based processing over the period 1986−2040. Five LULC classes were identified F, SG, PC, UA, and W, with results showing increases in F, PC, and UA, and a reduction in SG. These changes are associated with multiple physical, socioeconomic, and political-institutional factors, including population growth, migration, and the availability of basic services.</p><p>The CA-Markov model effectively predicted urban expansion patterns, indicating that growth will continue toward the northeast, southeast, and tsouth of the city by 2040. These projections provide valuable inputs for sustainable urban planning and territorial management in transforming Andean areas.</p><p>Future research should integrate additional social and economic variables (e.g., income levels, education, housing policies), and explore alternative machine learning-based predictive models (e.g., ANN, SVM) to enhance forecasting accuracy and adaptability to different urban contexts.</p>
