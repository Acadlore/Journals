      <abstract><p>Neutrosophy is a special area of philosophy that explains the nature, genesis and scope of neutralities, like the interactions with diverse ideational hues. It showed the degree of indeterminacy as an independent component that was the extension of an intuitionistic set. In this paper, the interpretation of the linear equation of type $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{X} +\mathcal{B} =\mathcal{C}$ are discussed in a neutrosophic environment. It is observed that the equations $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{X} +\mathcal{B} =\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{X} =\mathcal{C} -\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{X} -\mathcal{C} =-\mathcal{B}$ are same and their solution are also same in crisp sense. But, in the neutrosophic sense, the solutions to the above equations are different. Mathematical operations on intervals are considered for the purpose of solution and analysis. Further, an application of budgeting-financing is described with the help of neutrosophic fuzzy equation.</p></abstract>

            <title>1.1. Fuzzy sets theory with its extension and applications</title>
          
          <p>Zadeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] introduced a fuzzy set in his first paper in 1965. The degree of belongingness in terms of membership function is captured by the theory. Further, the extension was developed in 1986 by Prof. Atanassov, namely the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. It captured the degree of belongingness and non belongingness by non-membership and degree of membership function. Another theory introduced by Smarandache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] is neutrosophic sets, which are extensions of fuzzy sets by incorporating three membership degrees: truth, indeterminacy and falsity idea. There are several extensions like Type-2 Fuzzy Sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], Interval-Valued Fuzzy Sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], Fuzzy Rough Sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], etc. All ideas are based on providing that extra flexibility in representing uncertainty.</p><p>Not only in theoretical perspective, fuzzy sets and its application are very important for modelling real world problems. Modelling real-world problems with fuzzy sets and their extensions is vital for handling the integral uncertainty, ambiguity, and vagueness that describe many complex fields, such as decision-making theory, control theory, optimization, model simulation and risk valuation, etc. Fuzzy sets allow and its extensions supplementary layers of uncertainty, such as inadequate knowledge and indistinguishability, thus making models further robust and adaptive in uncertain settings. For example, anyone can follow the recent application in the field of Women's empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], Diabetes modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], Industrial engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], Population dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], Transportation problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] and Epidemic modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p>

            <title>1.2. Neutrosophic set and its application in different areas</title>
          
          <p>In 1995, Smarandache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] proposed the degree of uncertainty as an independent element representing the neutrosophy set. </p><p>There are many applications of neutrosophic numbers in real life, some of which are mentioned below. Majumder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] mainly proposed single valued neutrosophic fuzzy set (SVNFS) to avoid the difficulties of some real-life problems with the nonstandard interval of neutrosophic elements. This work also introduced the distance measures between two SVNFS in 2020. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) procedure is also presented to apply this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Khalil et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] have applied the neutrosophic number to decision making in their work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] respectively. Koundal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] mainly showed that prognosis and diagnosis are the most complex and challenging work in the world of medical science due to the limited subjectivity of experts and it is generalized by neutrosophic theory. In 2020, Fei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] have presented the application in a wireless network with the help of a neutrosophic graph. Gulistan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] demonstrated the application in industry performance evaluation by using neutrosophic cubic graphs in 2018.</p>

            <title>1.3. Motivation and novelties of the study</title>
          
          <p>Fuzzy equations can address different real world’s problems within their mathematical representatives. These are primarily represented by the models of the ambiguity linear system. The neutrosophic fuzzy equation investigates various mathematical approaches to the models' volatility with the help of neutrosophic fuzzy set theory. Sometimes, it is used in different fields, such as artificial intelligence, decision-making, etc. To solve various real-life applications such as budgeting and financing, we have used and processed neutrosophic fuzzy equations. </p>

          <p>This portion provides a proper explanation of this research. The introduction of this work is highlighted in Section 1. Then, Section 2 conveys the literature survey of this work. Then, the preliminary concepts of mathematical tools are discussed in Section 3. Further, in Section 4, we consider three different types of linear equations and solve these with neutrosophic numbers. Therefore, we take the numerical examples in Section 5. Additionally, Section 6 covered the application of neutrosophic fuzzy equations. The research findings are explained in Section 7 in this paper. Finally, conclusions and future research scope are exhibited in Section 8. </p>

            <title>2.1. Background on neutrosophic set and number</title>
          
          <p>An extension of the fuzzy set, which is also called the classical set with a certain amount of ambiguity, was the notion of the neutrosophic set. It studied the nature, origin and scope of neutralities and solved the problems to find the solution of having vagueness, indeterminacy or uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. neutrosophic numbers are mainly used to solve integral equations, differential equations, difference equations, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. The perfect review of the neutrosophic set are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>A neutrosophic fuzzy number (NFN) allows for a more comprehensive representation of ambiguity, especially when addressing undetermined or unreliable information. By including truth, indeterminacy, and falsity membership values, it enriches fuzzy numbers. While fuzzy numbers basically depend only on membership functions, the NFN account for the degree to which an element belongs to a set, simply because they include membership, indeterminacy and non-membership. In 2018, Deli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>] represented many kinds of neutrosophic sets and numbers, such as single valued neutrosophic sets, trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers, single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers, etc., in his research work. Muthulakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] also discussed the neutrosophic numbers and described their properties in 2022.</p><p>Neutrosophic numbers are used in numerous fields, including MCDM problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>], differential equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>] and difference equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], respectively. More literature on the neutrosophic numbers are disclosed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

            <title>2.2. Background on uncertain equation</title>
          
          <p>In this section, we discuss different papers on fuzzy equations. We also notice here that these fuzzy equations are solved using different fuzzy numbers, such as pentagonal fuzzy numbers, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, neutrosophic numbers, etc. To de-marking the ambiguity in different mathematical modelling, fuzzy equations are generally studied in fuzzy logic and control systems. Zadeh's major work on fuzzy sets and its improvements in uncertain arithmetic and systems play an important role in it. Applications of fuzzy equations are now spread in various fields, i.e., optimisation, decision-making and artificial intelligence. A short literature review on uncertain equations with the help of different types of fuzzy numbers is noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

          <p>Zadeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>] proposed the fuzzy set notion. Instead of having the single elements, the fuzzy set has ordered pair set elements. Also, rather than being completely in or out, each element can have various membership functions and belong to a fuzzy set.</p><p>Definition 1. Fuzzy Set</p><p>Let us choose <inline-formula>

It can be distinguished by a membership function. Fuzzy numbers are specially used to model on vague environments like artificial intelligence, decision-making and control processes. It can handle uncertainty, as opposed to crisp numbers, which makes it helpful in challenging various real-world problems where accuracy is difficult to get.</p><p>Definition 2.

          <p>Remark 13. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> indicates that the membership function is increasing but both the indeterminacy and non-membership functions are decreasing. After reaching the maximum value $1$, the membership function is decreasing and the indeterminacy and non-membership functions are increasing. This actually makes for the perfect visualisation.</p>

      <title>7. Research findings</title>
      <p>In this portion, we briefly discuss what we found from this total research paper. The study findings are described as below,</p><p>(a) Three different types of linear equations are solved in neutrosophic environment and their behaviour are also addressed.</p><p>(b) We convert the linear equation into a neutrosophic equation and obtain the final result with three different cases.</p><p>(c) A real-life application, like budgeting and finance, is depicted for a better understanding of neutrosophic equations.</p>

      <title>8. Conclusions and future research scope</title>
      <p>Traditional fuzzy numbers are extended by NFN with incorporating degrees of membership, indeterminacy and non-membership, making them more appropriate for controlling ambiguous data. We have solved the linear fuzzy differential equation with the concept of neutrosophy. In various real-life applications, like decision-making, healthcare diagnosis and engineering related problems, these equations are highly productive. These equations deliver a more elaborate mathematical structural work by integrating neutrosophic concepts for handling tough situations with uncertain environments. Their applications exhibit increased accuracy and scalability compared to standard fuzzy set theory. Finally, neutrosophic fuzzy equations offer strong equipment for solving different kinds of problems, including uncertainty and ambiguity in several fields. We exhibit the required solution of the neutrosophic equation of the three different cases with the help of the basic concept of hukuhara difference, neutrosophic characterization theorem and interval arithmetic operations, which are constructed in this research paper. The solutions of neutrosophic equation concepts are also applied here to real-life applications. </p><p>This research work has some limitations. So, its extension of future research work describes here. We use triangular neutrosophic number to solve the linear fuzzy equation. The solution of these equations can also be found with different types of neutrosophic numbers, s.t., non-linear neutrosophic numbers, trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers, single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers, type-2 neutrosophic numbers, etc. We can also consider the non-linear, non-homogeneous neutrosophic equations and find more numerical and analytical methods to solve these. Moreover, we can solve more real-life oriented applications associated with uncertain data.</p>
