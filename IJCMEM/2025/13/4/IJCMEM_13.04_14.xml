      <abstract><p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are inherently susceptible to malicious packet-dropping attacks, including black holes, gray holes and selective forwarding attacks that greatly decrease the reliability and performance of MANETs. Current solutions for detecting malicious attacks have large false-positive rates because they often confuse an intended malicious drop with an unintended loss caused by limited resources, traffic congestion and/or the impairment of wireless channels. In addition, current solutions can be vulnerable to acknowledgment (ACK) forgery attacks and consume considerable amounts of energy in continuously monitoring packets. The authors present a comprehensive four-phase framework that synergistically combines route qualification based on available resources, password-based mutual authentication using chaotic map Diffie Hellman password authenticated key exchange (CMDH-PAKE), authenticated digested ACKs based on counters and selectively activating promiscuous monitors to accurately detect and mitigate malicious packet-dropping attacks in MANETs at low power. The authors’ solution identifies and excludes honest-but-constrained nodes during route discovery by estimating buffer congestion using exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and modeling energy feasibility, thus reducing false positives by up to 73%. Binding keys between cryptographic sessions reduces the potential for ACK forgery and impersonation attacks, and aggregated window-based ACKs reduce energy use by 85%, relative to per-packet ACKs. Selectively activating monitors on demand using only cryptographic evidence of anomalies minimizes the energy used while still maintaining a high level of detection accuracy (above 96%). Simulation results using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) indicate that the authors’ solution has a higher packet delivery ratio (94.2%), shorter end-to-end delay (127 ms), and much lower false-positive rate (3.1%) than other approaches; in addition, the authors’ solution uses about 42% less energy than always-on monitoring approaches.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are an example of an infrastructure-less, wireless communication paradigm, where mobile nodes self-configure to create temporary network topologies without a reliance on either a base station or central controller. Each node is capable of operating as both a terminal device and a router.</p><p>The characteristics of MANETs make them appealing to use in such situations as emergency response scenarios, military tactical operations, disaster recovery missions, vehicular ad hoc networks and temporary event networking.</p><p>Adaptability and Durability MANETs come up with security weakness; the wireless channel and strong topology with recurring node movement, lack of central monitoring mechanism, limited computational materials and restrained energy finances and inclusive trust in cooperative packet forwarding produces an attack surface that fraudulent nodes can make use of; Intentional packet drop is another attack that deliver severe risk to network reliability. In this type of attack, a compromised node will intentionally discard data packets which it should have forwarded resulting in reduction of packet delivery ratio.</p><p>Scope and Methodological Focus: The current study mainly focuses on simulations and analysis through the computational process to determine the quality of the framework presented in the study. In fact, most of the related literature on MANETs and overall MANETs’ security is related to controlled simulations, which have presented repeatable and scalable results. In reality, the computational complexity for the presented framework is linear, depending on the number of nodes participating in the process because the cryptographic calculation is only dependent on the source and destination, and the task of monitoring is only activated when necessary. Although a testbed implementation would have made the study more realistic, the current study is basically simulation-based to ensure repeatable results are obtained.</p><p>The sections of related works and security analysis are streamlined to provide clear, focused discussions, with reduced redundancy, emphases on comparative insights among the approaches that exist, and clearer articulation of practical implications of the framework proposed.</p>

            <title>1.1. Motivation and challenges</title>
          
          <p>Several challenges exist in detecting intentional packet dropping attacks in MANETs. First, packet losses in wireless networks arise from multiple sources including buffer overflow due to congestion, medium access collisions, signal attenuation and fading, link breakages due to node mobility, and energy depletion causing nodes to go offline. watchdog-based and acknowledgment-based detection schemes traditionally indiscriminately flag all packet losses as potentially being an attack resulting in excessively high false positive rates where honest nodes that experience temporary resource constraints are wrongly accused and isolated thereby degrading network connectivity and performance.</p><p>Second, many of the existing schemes rely on end-to-end or hop-by-hop acknowledgments (ACKs) to verify packet delivery, but these ACKs themselves are vulnerable to forgery by sophisticated attackers. a malicious node can impersonate the destination or intermediate nodes and fabricate false ACKs that will deceive the source into believing the packets were successfully delivered when they were actually dropped. without cryptographic binding between ACKs and legitimate endpoints, detection mechanisms based solely on receipt of ACKs become unreliable.</p><p>Third, as mentioned earlier, in terms of resource constraints in a mobile ad hoc network with limited battery power, always-on monitoring will significantly shorten the network’s lifetime, and could be considered a denial-of-service attack by nature of the fact that always-on monitoring is inherently wasteful and unnecessary. Furthermore, as stated previously, due to the inherent ambiguity of wireless transmission caused by collisions, the “hidden terminal” problem, and capture effects, there are likely to be cases where the monitoring node cannot determine conclusively whether a packet was intentionally dropped by an attacker or lost due to the normal vagaries of wireless communication.</p><p>Fourth, the inconsistency of malicious behavior in gray hole and selective dropping attacks presents unique detection challenges. For example, an attacker might forward all packets of one type normally to avoid detection, while selectively dropping other types based upon source/destination pairs, temporal patterns, etc. This type of intermittent malicious behavior will require sustained monitoring and sophisticated statistical analysis to distinguish from the normal variability of wireless loss rates.</p>

            <title>1.2. Contributions</title>
          
          <p>The remainder of this paper addresses these challenges through the following three key contributions:</p><p>1. A new route qualification approach for MANETs, which uses energy-aware routing to prevent the routing through genuine but constrained nodes. The proposed method makes use exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to calculate buffer congestion and develops energy feasibility to reduce false positives and detach malicious nature from benign losses.</p><p>2. Integrating a password enabled mutual authentication using Chaotic Maps Diffie-Hellman Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (CMDH-PAKE) for establishing of cryptographically secure session keys between the source and destination, thereby avoiding impersonation attacks and ACK forgery.</p><p>3. Designing counter based authenticated ACKs that accumulate packet delivery confirmations with time, notably reduce ACK overhead while keeping up detection capability with cryptographic integrity verification.</p><p>4. Developing selective on-demand monitoring strategy that triggers localized monitoring only when cryptographic evidence advices anomalies, minimizing energy utilization while giving precise localization of malicious nodes.</p><p>5. Comprehensive performance evaluations through extensive Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) simulation results demonstrate superior detection accuracy (96.3%), low false positive rates (3.1%), high packet delivery ratios (94.2%) and significant energy savings (42% reduction) compared to existing methods.</p><p>This is significant because this effort has woven various techniques together into a comprehensive set. It deals with resource-conscious route establishment, CMDH-PAKE-based ACK messages, windowed loss resilience, and selective promiscuous listening, and they complement each other because they all have gaps that the others fill. Cryptographic verification, statistical loss identification, and behavioral analysis all help and reinforce each other because they understand the role they play together and help mitigate false positives and energy consumption when these methods are used together.</p>

            <title>2.1. Watchdog and monitoring-based approaches</title>
          
          <p>Marti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] presented an early watchdog mechanism employing promiscuous monitoring where every node overheard communication from its next-hop neighbors in order to detect packet-forwarding activity. Although the method is relatively simple, it also has many serious deficiencies including: (a) distinguishing between malicious drops and transmission failures of the wireless link, (b) vulnerability to receiver collisions and low transmission power, (c) false misbehavior detection resulting from ambiguous collisions, and (d) continuous monitoring overhead will deplete battery resources quickly. Many subsequent developments attempted to address certain of these deficiencies but did not resolve the fundamental problem of false positives.</p><p>Improved watchdog-based monitoring schemes such as 2ACK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], TWOACK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], and Enhanced Acknowledgment (EAACK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] utilize both overhearing and explicit acknowledgements and cannot distinguish between packet-drops caused by congestion, and those caused by malicious behavior. The EAACK scheme added digital signatures to prevent ACK forgery but resulted in significant cryptographic overhead, and did not consider the resource-constrained nature of honest nodes. Collaborative watchdog-based monitoring schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] utilize cooperative communication among neighboring nodes to reduce ambiguity but result in additional communication overhead, and are vulnerable to collusion attacks.</p>

            <title>2.2. Acknowledgment-based schemes</title>
          
          <p>End-to-end and/or hop-by-hop ACKs may be used to confirm the successful receipt of a packet in pure acknowledgement-based monitoring schemes. Cooperative Neighbor-based Fault Detection (CONFIDANT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] integrated trust management with acknowledgement-based monitoring, however, results in generating numerous control messages. Selective acknowledgment (SACK) mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] reduce the number of control messages generated by only acknowledging missing packets, but are still vulnerable to forgery. Cryptographic ACKs utilizing hash-chains or digital signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] prevent forgery, but generate both communication and computation overhead that grows exponentially with network size and traffic load.</p><p>Fixed window-based ACK aggregation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] decrease total messages but are static and therefore do not react to different traffic patterns or changing network conditions. Additionally, most ACK aggregation methods rely on having reliable reverse paths to the sender. In high frequency-changing MANETS this is often not true. Finally, there is no mutual authentication between the source and destination of packets which means they are subject to impersonation attacks where malicious nodes use fake identities to create false ACKs.</p>

            <title>2.3. Reputation and trust-based systems</title>
          
          <p>Behavioral reputation systems evaluate nodes based upon how well they forward packets. Collaborative Reputation Mechanism (CORE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] utilizes a cooperative reputation system using three types of reputations; subjective reputation (how others see you), indirect reputation (what others think about your neighbors), and functional reputation (your ability to forward packets). Observation-based Cooperation Enforcement in Ad hoc Networks (OCEAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] uses an observation-based cooperation enforcement method however it requires large amounts of memory to store all the reputation information. Bayesian models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] use probability distributions to represent a nodes behavior however they are limited by their need for a lot of observation data to converge and their inability to quickly respond to rapidly changing topologies.</p><p>All of the above methods have inherent problems such as: (a) Bad-mouthing attack and ballot-stuffing attack vulnerabilities where a malicious node will degrade the reputation of other good nodes, (b) gray hole attack vulnerabilities where a malicious node will suddenly start dropping packets, (c) resource constraint vs. malicious node problem where it is difficult to determine if a node has been compromised or just lacks resources, and (d) computational overhead involved in computing and disseminating reputation information. Most importantly, none of the above methods utilize an explicit prevention mechanism for ACK forgery, and therefore rely on majority voting or threshold based decision-making that sophisticated attackers can exploit through coordinated collusion.</p>

            <title>2.4. Intrusion detection systems</title>
          
          <p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) utilizing machine learning techniques analyze packet streams to detect anomalies indicative of attacks. Techniques including support vector machines (SVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], ensemble methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] have all had some degree of success depending on the application scenario. These methods require large datasets of training examples representing various attack scenarios, are sensitive to changes in network characteristics (concept drift), and cannot provide a low false positive rate without compromising detection capability. Selecting features relevant to the problem domain, classifying packets in real-time remains computationally expensive for resource constrained wireless mobile devices.</p><p>Hybrid mechanisms combining specification-based monitoring with anomaly detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] improves accuracy but struggle with the challenge of attributing packet. Statistical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] like sequential probability ratio tests provides formal detection which guarantees but require very careful threshold tuning and cannot adapt to different heterogeneous network conditions where different nodes experience differing loss rates due to legitimate factors.</p>

            <title>2.5. Cryptographic and authentication approaches</title>
          
          <p>The use of cryptographic primitives for the protection of detection mechanisms has recently become an area of research. Hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] provides integrity of the data but is based on pre-shared keys. Public key infrastructure (PKI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] provides strong authentication but the computational cost as well as the communication overhead is too high to be used in MANET environments. Using identity-based cryptography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] reduces the certificate management burden; however, a trusted third party is required for the generation of keys.</p><p>Password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols have been proposed for MANET authentication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]; however, they have limited application in packet dropping detection. chaotic map-based cryptography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] can be computed efficiently compared to traditional public key schemes; however, existing MANET security protocols that are based on chaotic maps primarily focus on data confidentiality and integrity rather than attack detection. To our knowledge, there is no prior work on integrating chaotic map-based pake for preventing ACK forgery in packet dropping detection.</p>

            <title>2.6. Summary of limitations</title>
          
          <p>Although many researchers have worked extensively on packet dropping detection schemes, existing schemes have significant limitations:</p><p>• High false positive rates due to inability to distinguish malicious drops from resource-constrained or collision-induced losses.</p><p>• Vulnerable to ACK forgery and impersonation attacks because there is no binding of session keys.</p><p>• High energy consumption due to continuous promiscuous monitoring or per-packet ACK.</p><p>• Poor localization accuracy when identifying malicious nodes within multi-hop paths.</p><p>• Lack of integrated framework combining resource awareness, cryptographic authentication, efficient acknowledgement and selective monitoring.</p><p>Our proposed four phase framework systematically addresses these limitations through synergistic integration of complementary techniques achieving superior detection accuracy, low false positives and low energy consumption.</p>

Which means nodes transmit packets to each other so that the messages can travel farther than a single hop.</p><p>• Each node has a buffer that handles up to (<italic>B_max</italic>), and their energy is not unlimited.

          <p>Our framework aims to tackle the below issues:</p><p>• High detection accuracy: Identify the malicious nodes with at least 95% detection rate.</p><p>• Low false positives: Keep false positives at 5% or lower.</p><p>• Avoid forged ACKs: Assure that ACKs are tied to real source-destination so that the attackers can’t fake them.</p><p>• Energy efficient: Minimize the monitoring overhead. It must not use more than 10% energy compared to normal.</p><p>• Pinpoint the problem: Identify accurately which node is being malicious in any route so that we can fix the things fast.</p><p>• Scalability: Maintain detection performance as network size increases up to 100 nodes with varying mobility patterns.</p><p>• Low Communication Overhead: Reduce control message traffic compared to per-packet ACK schemes by <inline-formula>

      <title>4. Proposed work</title>
      <p>The proposed solution is an integrated and multi-step process whereby every step confirms and strengthens one another. Through route qualification with awareness, the uncertainty related to constrained nodes can be removed. Authenticated acks provide credible proof of losses, and the process to check all routes gets triggered only if anomalies persist.</p><p>Resilient We combined a framework to catch and counter Intentional Packet Dropping (IPD) attacks in MANETs. It in 4 connected phases, each doing its own task but working together: Firstly, the routes are qualified based on resources. Nodes check their own energy levels and buffer congestion before joining a route. If a node is running low or overloaded on power, it leaves. This simple step will reduce false alarms from genuine nodes dropping packets. Next, we use a password enabled mutual authentication approach CMDH-PAKE. Before transmitting the data, both source and destination nodes prove to each other they are legitimate, using a pre-approved password to generate a session key. This ensures that the ACKs cannot be faked. If the authentication itself is failed, then the session will not start.</p>

In source-routing protocols such as DSR, the very same eligibility checks can be performed during route reply elaboration, while proactive protocols such as Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) periodically disseminate resource status by control messages or embed it into link-state metrics. As the framework does not depend on specific routing decisions and requires only local resource appraisal, authenticated ACKs, and selective monitoring, it may easily adapt to other MANET routing protocols by making minor protocol-specific modifications.</p>

</inline-formula>) between communicating source–destination pairs. Such assumptions are realistic for many MANET scenarios, such as military units, emergency response teams, and vehicular clusters, where nodes are provisioned during deployment or share credentials by way of prior secure contact. Password update or revocation can be done easily by invalidating the corresponding session and reinitiating authentication with a new password upon route change or suspected compromise. Password exposure and replay risks are thus minimized due to the fact that it is never transmitted over the network and session keys are derived using fresh ephemeral values. The underlying password distribution methodology itself keeps the framework independent, which allows seamless integration of most existing MANET key pre-distribution or out-of-band credential mechanisms.</p>

      <title>5. Performance evaluation</title>
      <p>Here, we get into a detailed performance check of the framework, working with NS-3 tool 3.36 version. We observed on how well the tool detects threats, how many false alarms show up, how packets get delivered reliably, and how much time it took for data to travel across the network. Above all, we tracked energy use and any additional overhead. We tested this under different attacks, changing mobility, and a variety of network sizes.</p><p>Simulation Scope and Limitations: To compare performance, we can fall back on typical mobility and traffic simulations to ensure comparability with current MANET security literature. While they are good representatives of real behavior, actual conditions may deviate, depending on capabilities, irregular movements, and/or interference in real-world settings, which would otherwise be taken into account in absolute performance measurements. In any case, the performance gains observed over a wide spectrum of scenarios are not affected by such differences. In the future, a natural path would be to conduct larger-scale simulations or actual deployments.</p><p>Energy Overhead Analysis: In simple words, analysis reveals that the energy consumed over and above in our scheme is primarily because of the CMDH-PAKE authentication and selective and targeted promiscuous mode monitoring. In the CMDH-PAKE phase, only the communicating nodes are involved and not the routers, thus keeping the cryptographic costs light. In the case of the second phase, the energy used for monitoring is minimized and restricted to small regions of the network, and it is triggered only in case there are anomalies in the authenticated acknowledgement messages, not otherwise. Our simulations have found that the cumulative energy overhead is quite reasonable and, in fact, insignificant compared to the enhancement in the detection accuracy and the delivery ratio achieved through our scheme.</p>

            <title>5.2. Detection accuracy and false positives</title>
          
          <p>Detection accuracy proves on how well the system spotted the malicious nodes. The false positives tell us how often it wrongly alarmed the genuine ones. When the attack intensity is in between 10–40%, the framework manages to obtain an average detection accuracy of 96.3% for black-hole attacks, and 94.7% accuracy for gray-hole attacks. Even in difficult times, the false positive does not go up, it is steady at 3.1%. This proves that the system does a good job apart from harmless glitches and real threats.</p><p>Resource-aware qualification weeds about 78% of honest nodes in Phase-I. Cryptographic authentication blocks each ACK forgery attempt in Phase-II of our tests, nothing is missed. Selective monitoring zeroes in Phase-IV on the exact malicious hop in a multi-hop path with 97.4% accuracy.</p>

            <title>5.3. Packet delivery ratio</title>
          
          <p>Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) basically shows the number of data packets reach to the destination. In a regular network, you will get PDR about 95.3%. But if 40% of the nodes turn into black-holes, PDR drops very fast, then the PDR go down to 47.2%. Now, with the proposed framework, things got better. Even when 40% of the nodes drop, it maintains PDR high at 94.2%. It is because; the proposed approach kicks out the bad actors (approximately in 12.3 seconds) and finds optimal paths for the data. Even if 40% of the nodes turn into gray-holes, the system maintains PDR at 91.8%. So, it is evident that against attackers it is always predictable.</p>

          <p>It covers transmission, queuing, propagation and processing time. With this new framework, the extra delay is very much minimal. The average end-to-end delay rises from 118 ms to 127 ms with regular AODV when there are 20% attacks. The slight increase happens because the system repairs the routes and sometimes picks up lengthy paths to dodge bad nodes. Unlike always monitoring that pushes the delays past 400 ms, this framework always keeps things running smoothly.</p>

            <title>5.5. Energy consumption</title>
          
          <p>Energy efficiency is really important for mobile nodes that are powered by battery. We traced on energy utilized by each node while sending, receiving, or idle. Our framework uses about 8.7% more energy than the basic AODV without detection, just because of authentication and selective monitoring when required. It still saves a lot of power. It reduces energy consumption by 42% on watchdog schemes (which has 15.2% more), and by 68% compared to setups that sends ACK for every single packet (which has 27.4% more).</p><p>If you split the energy usage, authentication takes only 1.8%, selective monitoring accounts for 4.6%, and processing the ACKs uses 2.3%. The on-demand monitoring technique is really best. In many occasions, monitoring only consumes about 14.2% of communication sessions. Even if attacks go up to 40%, monitoring triggers in 31.7% of sessions. So, despite of draining the battery, you get strong protection and a smart balance between energy use and security.</p><p>Energy Model Considerations: In the given energy model, the focus is on those components of MANET protocols which are responsible for energy consumption, such as transmission, reception, encryption, and monitoring. The reason for not including the energy for idle listening, mode switching, and retransmission is to have a relatively lower absolute energy, although the trend will remain the same because both perspectives are affected equally. Thus, the energy consumption analysis is presented conservatively in the results.</p>

            <title>5.6. Communication overhead</title>
          
          <p>Communication overhead is used to trace about the network’s traffic sending control messages. Using window-based ACKs in Phase-III reduces ACK messages by 85%. So, if you transmit 1000 data packets, you get only 20 ACKs rather than 1000 separate ones. When you consolidate all the control messages, combined ACKs, authentication checks, and isolation alerts, they sum up to 6.3% of data traffic during a 20% attack. If the attack goes up to 40%, overhead increases to 11.2% as the system requires more detection and rerouting.</p>

            <title>5.7. Scalability analysis</title>
          
          <p>We verified the scalability of system from 25 to 100 nodes. Detection accuracy changed was very negligible; it was steady all the time, dropping very little from 96.1% to 95.8% as the network grows. This confirms that the localized monitoring approach is good for scaling. The false positive rate increases a little, from 2.8% to 3.4%, just because more routes mean more chance to go wrong during indefinite monitoring. PDR reduces little from 95.1% to 93.4% as more nodes were added to the network. It is because the average path between nodes increases. On the positive side, each node’s energy is almost the same, proving that the selective monitoring approach incurs overhead as the network grows.</p>

            <title>5.8. Impact of mobility</title>
          
          <p>As nodes move from idle to zipping around at 20 ms, the shape of the network changes. This will affect the route stability and can incur problems. Detection accuracy goes down a bit from 97.1% when things are at normal speed to 94.9% at top speed. When nodes accelerate, routes can break even before monitoring. But, the framework addresses this well and it reacts fast. The re-authentication is done in less than 230 ms whenever route changes. Furthermore, it adapts the monitoring period by 20% during high mobility, assuring there is enough time to catch issues. False positives slightly increase from 2.6% to 3.8% as mobility increases. It is just because the system sometimes considers normal connection drops as monitoring windows shortage.</p>

  <mml:math id="mnrtsrshqm">

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, choosing moderate thresholds provides a reasonable trade-off that offers quick detection without many false alarms. In summary, the framework shows robustness with the variation of the parameters within a reasonable range.</p>

Analysis has shown that malicious nodes are detected with certainty only after few observation cycles of ACK anomalies occur, averaging approximately a few seconds in moderately active networks when there is conclusive proof of irregular packet loss.</p>

          <p>The basic watchdog mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] achieves 89.3% detection accuracy but suffers from 24.7% false positive rate due to inability to distinguish malicious drops from wireless collisions and congestion. Our framework reduces false positives to 3.1% (87.4% improvement) through resource-aware route qualification that preemptively excludes honest-but-constrained nodes. Energy consumption comparison shows Watchdog requires continuous monitoring overhead of 15.2% compared to our selective approach at 8.7% (42.8% reduction). Collaborative watchdog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] improves detection to 92.1% but maintains high false positives (18.4%) and introduces 23.1% communication overhead from neighbor coordination messages, compared to our 6.3% overhead.</p>

Our aggregated window-based approach achieves higher detection (96.3%) with 85% less ACK traffic. EAACK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] includes digital signatures for ACK integrity instead incurs 27.4% energy overload from Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) signatures compared to our hash-based verification at 8.7% penalty. Additionally, EAACK has 12.1% false positive rate as it deficits resource-aware qualification, while our framework attains 3.1%.</p>

False positive rate of 16.3% results from slow adaptation to legitimate resource constraints, in contrast to our proactive filtering at 3.1%. OCEAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] gives 91.7% detection with 14.8% false positives but utilizes significant memory (on an average of 2.4 MB per node) for reputation tables in a 100-node network, while our stateless cryptographic approach needed minimal storage ($&lt;$1 KB per active session).</p>

Our framework attains 96.3% detection without any requirements of training and minimal computation (6.4% of CPU). Neural network techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] need offline training and scuffle with concept drift as the attack patterns evolve, while our cryptographic and threshold-based detection adapts immediately with new attack through adjustable parameters <inline-formula>

            <title>8.1. Conclusion</title>
          
          <p>This paper has introduced a comprehensive 4-phase framework for detecting and mitigating intentional packet dropping attacks in MANETs. The framework superscribes critical limitations of existing methods through four synergistic phases: resource-aware route qualification that proactively excludes honest, but constrained nodes to reduce false positive rate by 73%, password-enabled mutual authentication using CMDH-PAKE to establish cryptographically secure session keys avoiding ACK forgery, resisting authenticated digested ACKs that minimizes overhead by 85% while keeping-up detection capability, and selective on-demand indiscriminate monitoring that descends energy consumption by 42% through triggers only upon cryptographic evidence of anomalies.</p><p>Extensive NS-3 simulations demonstrate superior performance: 96.3% detection accuracy for black hole attacks and 94.7% for gray hole attacks, false positive rate of only 3.1%, packet delivery ratio maintained at 94.2% even under 40% attack intensity, end-to-end delay increase limited to 7.6%, and energy overhead constrained to 8.7% compared to baseline routing. Security analysis proves robustness against ACK forgery, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, replay, and collusion attacks. Evaluation comparison confirms that the proposed framework surpasses the modern approaches across all metrics including detection accuracy, energy consumption, communication overhead, false positives, and detection latency.</p><p>Although the framework performs well, the current implementation and evaluation are restricted to simulations and are based on lightweight pre-shared credentials for communication between nodes. For the future, scaling the framework to a large MANET, including parameter adaptation, and simulation and testbed experiments using mobility traces would be appropriate goals for further development.</p>

            <title>8.2. Future work</title>
          
          <p>The below are some directions for future research:</p><p>• Adaptive parameter tuning: Develop machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust the thresholds and window sizes based on, traffic patterns, practical network conditions, and observed attack features.</p><p>• Cross-layer optimization: Combine the detection framework closely with physical layers and MAC layers to hold state information along with quality metrics of the link for optimized discrimination between wireless impairments and malicious drops.</p><p>• Distributed blockchain-based reputation: Explore blockchain technology to maintain tamper-proof distributed reputation ledgers that augment cryptographic detection with long-term behavioral history while preserving decentralization.</p><p>• Quality of service integration: Expand the framework to support variety of protection and detection for quality-of-service sensitive traffic classes (like A/V, emergency communications, etc.) through ranking-based monitoring and fast response methods.</p><p>• Hardware implementation: develop hardware accelerators for Chebyshev polynomial and hash-based operations to further minimize energy consumption and work on ultra-low-power IoT devices.</p><p>• Advanced attack scenarios: Explore detection mechanisms for advanced attacks including worm-hole attacks combined with packet dropping that exploit route discovery and that adjusts dropping rate based on the detection probability.</p><p>• Experimental validation: Supervise wide experiments using real devices (like smart mobile phones, embedded devices) in variety of environments to authenticate simulation results.</p><p>• Privacy-preserving detection: incorporate differential privacy techniques to prevent leakage of sensitive traffic patterns and communication metadata through control messages while maintaining detection effectiveness.</p><p>• Heterogeneous network support: Expand the framework to hybrid ad hoc networks incorporating Wi-Fi access points, cellular infrastructure, and peer-to-peer links with seamless detection across variety of network segments.</p>
