      <abstract><p>The urban fringe area is a transitional area between urban and rural areas which supports urban ecological functioning. Vegetation is an element of biodiversity that is important for the sustainability of urban life. The balance of the ecosystem is maintained with the help of the biodiversity of the urban fringe area where environmental functions and services will be able to run optimally. The important value index (IVI) in the vegetation structure is a quantitative measurement used to assess the health of vegetation in an area. Vegetation in the urban fringe region of Surakarta is dominated by types of Tectona grandis, Senna siamea, Mangifera indica, Switenia macrophylla and Leucaena leucocephala. Tectona grandis (220.02%), Falctaria moluccana (164.63%) and Pterocarpus indicus (142.55%) have the highest IVI vegetation in Karanganyar District. In Sukoharjo Regency, variations for the highest IVI were diverse with the highest IVI being Falcataria mollucana (171.49%), Tectona grandis (97.46%) and Gluta rengas (89.54%). Tectona grandis (230.99%) and Mangifera indica (145.53%) are the species with the highest IVI in Boyolali District. The high importance of Tectona grandis is based on the IVI count. The dominance of vegetation species in urban fringe is considered to be of high economic value for the community.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Urban areas are dynamic environments. Intervention of anthropogenic activities is a key factor in changing the urban environment. Meeting the needs of the population is the main thing in the development of a city where the balance of the urban environment is the key to the sustainability of life [1]. Biodiversity plays an important role in providing ecological functions in urban areas, where soil, water, air and plants interact and are linked in protecting the environment [2].</p><p>Vegetation is a major component in maintaining sustainable environmental conditions for urban areas [3]. It plays a multifunctional role, one of which is the control of the microclimate of urban areas [4] by mitigating the impacts of rising temperatures and global climate change, providing habitat for several types of animals, maintaining a balance of the material and energy cycle, and the hydrological cycle [5]. It is therefore an essential component within the context of urban areas vegetation and the monitoring of the condition of urban vegetation is a necessary thing in order to manage properly the functioning of urban ecology [6]. Vegetation analysis plays a crucial role in determining environmental management policies as it provides the necessary data to make informed decisions. It serves as a reliable source of information and helps weigh the options when formulating effective strategies for environmental conservation. The development of Surakara region has been so rapid in recent times that it has resulted in a significant lack of open space where land use changes have been sustained by an accelerated development and infrastructure. This necessitates urgent and holistic mitigation and adaptation measures are needed in an effort to maintain the sustainability of urban life.</p><p>The transformation of urban land use will undoubtedly have consequences for the state of open land, leading to further reduction in available habitat for vegetation growth. This condition is a problem that must be faced considering the function of vegetation as an urban buffer system. Environmental services obtained from vegetation are a major focus in the life balance of the city area [7] since the function of urban ecosystem services is highly dependent on vegetation conditions. The interaction between abiotic and sociocultural factors has an effect on the structure and function of vegetation [8].</p><p>To achieve a sustainable city, it is essential to have a well-developed environmental management plan. A holistic and ecological approach is the best step towards the balance of urban ecosystems [9]. Large anthropogenic pressures on urban areas should be minimized so that environmental degradation does not occur massively. The conditions of the urban environment are closely related to the sociocultural conditions of the settled population [10].</p><p>Vegetation has a major role in maintaining the homeostasis of urban life. The provision of ecosystem services is closely related to the health condition of vegetation [11]. The study of open lands as habitats for vegetation makes it easier to plan since vegetation is a biotic component that interacts with physical and social environmental conditions in a certain way [12]. Optimal conditions are expected to support the existence of vegetation so that its structure and function as a provider of ecosystem services can be maintained properly [13].</p>

      <title>2. Study area</title>
      <p>The study area is an urban fringe of Surakarta city which includes 3 regencies, namely Sukoharjo, Karanganyar and Boyolali Regencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). All three areas have undergone significant land use changes as a result of the agglomeration of Surakarta City. Of the three districts, the Karanganyar Regency area, which is located in the south of Surakarta City, still has potential open land. Karanganyar regency has a large open space area than others with temperature average 30.1°C, humidity 66.57% and soil organic matter 2.68%. This region consists of more green and open land. Karanganyar shows urban spreading to the south where most of the development on this area consists of urban settlement. Boyolali District shows the narrowest urban fringe in Surakarta. Air temperature of this area averages around 30.7°C and humidity 56.6%, soil pH 7.1 and soil organic matter content 1.78%. Sukoharjo District shows rapid development to the south of this area with a central commercial district known as Solo Baru area.</p>

            <title>2.1. Determination of ecological unit</title>
          
          <p>The determination of ecological units is based on the interpretation of sentinel 2A satellite imagery acquired on August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020 and the results of overlapping maps of soil type, land use and topography. Ecological units are obtained from the results of the map overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>). The landscape approach is hereby used in the determination of ecological units. Biophysical factors are closely related to the habitat conditions of vegetation. Differences in physical factors will affect the type and growth of vegetation in an area.</p>

            <title>2.2. Vegetation analysis</title>
          
          <p>For each ecological unit, vegetation analysis was carried out by calculating the Important Value Index. The calculation of the IVI was carried out at three growth rates, namely trees, saplings and seedlings. Each ecological unit has three measuring plot sizes: 20×20m, 10×10m and 5×5m. Sampling was carried out with ten consecutive repeats. The plot at each growth rate was then used to calculate the IVI. The IVI is calculated using the Mueller-Dombois and Ellenberg (1974) formulas, as follows:</p>

      <title>3. Results</title>
      <p>The ecological units based on the results of the map overlay consists of 48 pieces with 19 variations. The ecological units are spread across 3 areas of the urban fringe district of Surakarta. Sukoharjo District (12.5%), Boyolali District (8.33%) and Karanganyar District (79.2%) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. The calculation of the IVI of ecological units in each growth rate describing the vegetation structure is presented in the following <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>. Each ecological unit is categorized according to the tree species with the highest importance value index. The description of vegetation conditions is expected to facilitate steps in ecosystem service management in general.</p><p>The soil type is dominated by latosol and alluvial types. Topography of these ecological units can be described as gentle, flat and wavy. The dynamics of the landscape are specific so that they affect the biotic components in it in that changes in the landscape will be followed by changes in the structure and function of the vegetation in it. Most of the ecological units are located in the Karanganyar Regency area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>) where land use changes have not occurred much and vacant land is still widely found. Ecological units have experienced significant growth and expansion in the Karanganyar District. This has led to the gradual development of the southern area within this district. The development resulted in further settlement where more public facilities are required. Sukoharjo and Boyolali (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>) have more little open space because on Sukoharjo District has developed as a satellite city with a stronger center of trade and economy activities.</p>

            <title>3.1. Important value index</title>
          
          <p>Important value index (IVI) of tree species is determined as the sum of relative frequency (RF), relative density (RD), and relative abundance (RA). It measures how dominant a species is in a given area. This is the IVI count on trees, saplings and seedlings. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> shows IVI calculated from trees structure, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> shows IVI calculated from saplings structure and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> shows IVI calculated from seedlings structure.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>Diverse landscapes in urban areas play a crucial role in determining biodiversity conditions. The survival of the city area relies heavily on the provision of ecosystem services, which in turn depend on the condition of vegetation [14]. The important value that is attributed to biodiversity, especially vegetation, is based on the various roles it has in regulating the cycle and flow of matter within the city area. It is therefore crucial to effectively manage and optimize limited natural resources for the well-being of the population. The environmental carrying capacity of an area should be able to keep pace with the increase in population and the acceleration of development. If there is a decrease in the carrying capacity of an area, it will have an impact on the emergence of various environmental problems.</p><p>The increase in the number of resident populations is directly proportional to the increase in the number of needs [15]. Human activities will undoubtedly continue to disrupt the delicate balance of the study area. The process of urbanization will accelerate, leading to the expansion of cities into previously pristine areas. Unfortunately, this expansion will have a significant impact on the habitat conditions for biodiversity. Therefore, it is imperative that actors engage in effective planning efforts to mitigate these negative effects.</p><p>In a health ecosystem, it is expected that there is a balance between IVI inputs and outputs. The conditions needed for life to thrive rely on a delicate balance. Any pressure on urban environments, whether from natural factors or human activities, can hasten the decline in environmental quality. It is crucial to maintain an optimal environment to ensure the continuity of life as we know it [16].</p><p>Surakarta is a hub of activity for the surrounding cities where people migration occurs every day. The pressure on the environment of Surakarta city is thus inevitable. For example, during the period 1994 - 2000 the area of open land increased by 28.68 ha or 0.61%. Then in the period 2000 - 2017 this land was reduced by 5.06%, which is equivalent to 235.90 ha [17]. For this reason, it is necessary to support the provision of ecosystem services from urban fringe areas.</p>

      <p>The open land in urban fringe Surakarta changed from 16435.964 ha in 2015 to 16349.972 ha in 2020, amounting to a decrease by 0.52%. It is therefore hoped that the urban open land fringe of Surakarta will help provide optimization of the function of ecosystem services. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> shows that Karanganyar Regency has the largest non-built land area which amounts to 7244.41 ha, equivalent to 64% of the non-built land is in Gondangrejo District.

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The urban fringe area of Surakarta consists of Karanganyar, Sukoharjo and Boyolali Regencies. The relatively rapid change in use in the city of Surakarta has an impact on reducing the area of open land. As a result, environmental degradation continues to increase leading to suboptimal carrying capacity. The decrease in the area of open land reduces the possibility of the habitat to contain more vegetation. Therefore, the Surakarta urban fringe area needs support in the provision of ecosystem services.</p><p>From the analysis of overlay maps based on factors of soil type, topography and landform, 48 ecological units in the urban fringe Surakarta were identified. Karanganyar Regency has 37 ecological units, while Sukoharjo Regency has 6 ecological units and Boyolali Regency has 4 ecological units. For each ecological unit, the IVI calculation was carried out in order to provide an overview of the type and dominance of vegetation. Woody plant species dominate as seen from the highest IVI in the district. In addition to woody types of plants, fruit crops also dominate the types of each district.</p><p><italic>Tectona grandis</italic> (220.02%), <italic>Falctaria moluccana</italic> (164.63%) and <italic>Pterocarpus indicus</italic> (142.55%) are the plants with the highest IVI in Karanganuay District. In Sukoharjo Regency, the type variations for the highest IVI were diverse with the highest IVI being <italic>Falcataria mollucana</italic> (171.49%), <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> (97.46%) and <italic>Gluta rengas</italic> (89.54%). <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> (230.99%) and <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> (145.53%) are the species with the highest IVI in Boyolali District.</p><p>Based on the IVI description of vegetation types in each ecological unit in the Surakarta urban fringe area, it is hoped that it can help biodiversity management and planning. The types of vegetation that dominate are woody plants that are trade commodities and food crops. This is inseparable from the local wisdom of the community which considers woody plants as future savings that can be inherited. Food crops are expected to be able to meet consumption needs and as a trading commodity. Planning efforts related to biodiversity conservation of urban fringe areas are expected to be easier to make and implement. The effectiveness of providing ecosystem services in urban and urban fringe areas with recommendations for these types of plants will be more optimal. It is being recommended that further studies on community perceptions of biodiversity in urban fringe areas are conducted in order to determine the inhabitants’ level of understanding on the importance of ecological studies on the provision of urban environmental ecosystem services. In order to ensure the sustainability of urban areas, it is crucial to not only implement dynamic systems, but also closely monitor environmental changes and vegetation structures. By doing so, there can be effective mitigation of any negative impacts and provide informed decisions for the long-term well-being of these urban areas.</p>
