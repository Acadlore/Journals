      <abstract><p>Remote sensing plays a crucial role in disaster management. Moreover, its effectiveness is severely limited due to operational, technological and environmental challenges. Data acquisition can be disrupted by sensor limitations and by extreme events or natural factors, such as cloud cover. In fact, high-resolution imagery often requires significant processing time, specialized expertise and expensive infrastructure. Therefore, ensuring timely, accurate and accessible remote sensing data at all stages—preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation—is a major challenge. This study explores the application of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques using bipolar fuzzy numbers (BFNs) to evaluate this. We apply the weighted and ranking MCDM method, i.e., Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC) and Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), respectively, in this paper. The decisions of multiple decision makers (DMs) are considered when collecting this problem related data and BFNs are utilised as mathematical tools to handle uncertainty. In order to address the ambiguity and inconsistency of the system, we finally conclude to conduct the comparative and sensitivity analyses here with the final result.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>A remote sensor is a device that collects information about an object or event, mainly from a distance. For example, they can detect reflected or emitted energy from satellites or aircraft. The seven steps of remote sensing are energy source, radiation, and atmosphere, interaction with the target, recording of energy by the sensor, transmission, reception, processing, interpretation, analysis and application. These steps help to cover the entire process, from the initial energy source to the final use of the information obtained. Five common types of sensors are temperature, proximity, pressure, motion, and light sensors. They measure physical properties such as heat, detect the presence of objects, monitor the pressure of liquids, detect movement, and sense ambient light levels. Sensors are generally of two types, namely active and passive. Active sensors emit their own energy to collect information. They project energy (such as lasers or sound waves) onto an object and then accurately measure the reflected energy. For example, a sonar device on a ship sends out sound pulses to map the ocean floor. On the other hand, passive sensors, on the other hand, record natural energy reflected or emitted from the Earth’s surface. The most common source of radiation they detect is sunlight. For instance, a satellite camera can capture images of the Earth’s surface by reflecting sunlight.</p>

            <title>1.1. How does a remote sensor work</title>
          
          <p>Remote sensors work by detecting energy reflected or emitted from objects without direct physical contact. They use active or passive methods to measure energy by collecting information about physical properties such as temperature, composition or distance. This is usually in the form of electromagnetic radiation. In fact, in this method, they detect natural sunlight or heat (passive sensing), as well as transmitting their own energy, such as radar or laser pulses (active sensing). Then, when this energy interacts with the ground, it is reflected, absorbed or emitted differently by different objects. The sensor accurately measures these differences using specialized detectors. This collected energy is converted into digital signals. These are mainly sent to ground stations for processing. Then, through correction and enhancement, these are converted into usable images or maps. Finally, analysts interpret these products to extract information for applications such as disaster management, agriculture or environmental monitoring. </p>

            <title>1.2. Challenges of remote sensing for crucial role in all phases of disaster management</title>
          
          <p>Remote sensing faces several challenges in fulfilling its important role at all stages of disaster management. Various natural factors, such as cloud cover, smoke and bad weather, often block optical sensors. This results in reduced timely visibility during critical incidents. Moreover, rapid response is required during limited satellite re-imaging, which can delay data availability. On the other hand, high-resolution data and advanced sensors are very expensive and limited, which severely limits access for many organizations. The need for skilled personnel is essential to address this complex process, which slows down analysis. Again, integrating multi-sensor data such as optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle imagery can be technically difficult. Ground verification during disasters is often limited, which affects accuracy. Finally, in a rapidly changing disaster situation, providing clear and actionable information to decision makers (DMs) remains a challenge. </p>

          <p>Understanding the challenges of remote sensing in disaster management is crucial. Because accurate and timely information directly impacts life-saving decisions. Identifying these limitations can improve the acquisition, processing, and distribution of information in real time. It also inspires the development of advanced technologies, sensor fusion, and management strategies. Ultimately, addressing these challenges strengthens preparedness, response, and recovery efforts for safer and more resilient communities.</p><p>The following are the study’s primary objectives:</p><p>1.

            <title>1.4. Research outline</title>
          
          <p>In this section, we develop the study’s research outline based on the above study and motivation. The primary purpose of this study is to find out the main challenges of remote sensing for its crucial role in all phases of disaster management. There are four criteria and four different alternatives that are different in the disaster management phase. Two MCDM techniques, i.e., Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC) and Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), are selected as optimization tools and bipolar fuzzy numbers (BFNs) are appraised as ambiguous tools. Data are gathered in an impartial way and the result is numerically computed. Lastly, comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to check the stability and robustness of the proposed model.</p>

      <title>2. Literature survey</title>
      <p>The background of this topic is briefly covered in this section. First, we provide a brief literature review of remote sensing studies, followed by a survey of articles on BFNs, their analysis and applications. In addition, we conducted a short survey on the MCDM processes with their utilization in our everyday life. </p>

            <title>2.1. Background on application</title>
          
          <p>Remote sensing began in the 19th and 20th centuries with early aerial photography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], later expanded to satellite-based sensing after the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972, which revolutionized Earth observation. Remote sensors are devices that detect and measure energy reflected or emitted from objects on the Earth’s surface without direct contact. They operate in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum—such as visible, infrared, thermal and microwave-which allows them to capture a variety of information about land, water, atmosphere, and vegetation. In addition, remote sensors can play an important role in fields such as disaster management, agriculture, environmental monitoring, climate studies, and urban planning because of their ability to provide large, timely and accurate data.</p><p>Here, we review recent publications on remote sensing from different perspectives. These are, mathematical models with various methods for remote sensing image analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], discussion of various mathematical models of geometric correction applied to remote sensing images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], application in remote sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], utilising remote sensing for any type of mathematical modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], talk about on several remote sensing platforms and sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], remote sensing with the cryosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], various applications on remote sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], some fundamentals of remote sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], different application of remote sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], the contribution of remote sensing to the scale issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], neural networks in remote sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p>

            <title>2.2. Background of mathematical tool</title>
          
          <p>A BFN extends the traditional fuzzy number by representing both positive and negative dimensions of satisfaction simultaneously. The concept of bipolar fuzzy sets, from which BFNs are derived, was introduced by Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] in 1994. Unlike classical fuzzy numbers that use a single membership function, BFN uses two functions, namely, a positive membership and a negative membership, which indicate support and opposition, respectively. This dual representation allows for richer modelling. It is essential for MCDM, sentiment evaluation, and uncertain environments. Therefore, BFN serves as a key mathematical tool for capturing complex bipolar information in decision systems. Here, we will study the research papers that have already been published related to BFNs. These are, diagnosis by bipolar fuzzy electre-eye method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], use in group decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], a computational framework for cognitive modeling and multiagent decision analysis of Bipolar fuzzy sets (BFS) and its relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], bipolar fuzzy metric spaces with its proper application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], structure of regular bipolar fuzzy graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], required solution of fully bipolar fuzzy linear programming models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], solve linear system of equations in bipolar fuzzy environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. </p>

            <title>2.3. Literature of mcdm approaches</title>
          
          <p>An MCDM method is a structured approach to making a choice from multiple alternatives when faced with multiple, often conflicting, criteria. It is actually about finding the weights of the criteria and ranking the alternatives to solve a given problem. This decision-making method is applied to deal with uncertain environments. It helps in solving complete decision-making problems in real life with great ease. There are different types of MCDM methods, such as Analytic Hierarchy Process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], Entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], Complex Proportional Assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], MEREC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], MABAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], Data Envelopment Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], etc. Among them, MEREC and MABAC have been used in this paper. Here is a brief discussion of some of the already published papers on these two methods.</p><p>The MEREC approach was invented by Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Some studies applied this method in various areas, including: finding the weights of element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], developing fuzzy extension with the help of parabolic measure and its applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], evaluating objective weights in decision making problems in uncertain environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], assessing enterprise that based on Decarbonization Scheme with Grey-MEREC-MAIRCA (Multi-Attributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis) Hybrid MCDM Method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], choosing a perfect renewable energy source in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], selecting optimal Spray-Painting robot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], effectively solving Forklift Selection problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>].</p><p>Pamučar and Ćirović [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>] developed the MABAC methodology in 2015. Here are some papers on these approaches. These are, the literature review of MABAC methodology for sustainability and circularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], bibliometric analysis of various MCDM methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], an innovative multi-criteria integrated supplier selection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], ranking of green universities with the help of MCDM process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>], evaluating the best E-Commerce platform for online business [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], preference for high-performing work systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], find the best input factors for Powder-Mixed Electrical Discharge Machining 90CrSi tool steel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>], perfect material selection with incomplete weight information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>].</p>

          <p>BFS was first introduced by Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>] in 1994. BFS is an extension of fuzzy sets where two membership values are assigned to every element in the set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>]. The first membership function represents the satisfaction and the second membership function describes the violation of the elements in the BFS. The definitions and properties of BFS are described as follows:</p><p>Definition 4. BFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>]</p><p>Let <inline-formula>

          <p>De-fuzzification is a numerical process that crispifies fuzzy numbers, since there is no order relation on them. Several defuzzification formulas have been proposed in previous studies. In this research, we proposed a new de-fuzzification formula to crispify the BTFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>]. The proposed de-fuzzification formula is presented as follows:</p><p>Let a BTFN be defined as <inline-formula>

      <title>4. Proposed methodology</title>
      <p>This section discusses the mathematical methods of two MCDM methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>] used in the BTFN environment, namely MEREC and MABAC. MCDM is a popular optimization technique for dealing with multiple conflicting criteria and alternatives. First, describe the MEREC method for evaluating the weights of criteria and the MABAC method for ranking alternatives are further disclosed. </p>

            <title>4.1. Merec method</title>
          
          <p>In 2021, Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] first represented the MEREC method. It is an objective process for analysing the weights of factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. With this important process, this methodology is used to objectively find perfect criterion weights by measuring how the removal of each criterion affects the total decision performance.</p><p>The mathematical procedure of the MEREC method is formulated here. There are <inline-formula>

          <p>MABAC method was introduced by Pamučar and Ćirović [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>] in 2015. The fuzzy set integrated with the MABAC method can make the model more reliable and evaluate the result optimally. This desicion maling MABAC method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>] is used to rank the selected alternatives in MCDM by measuring their distances from a defined border approximation area (BAA).</p><p>The numerical procedure of the MCDM-based MABAC method is presented in this section under a TT2FN environment.

      <title>5. Criterion as remote sensing challenges in disaster management</title>
      <p>Due to limited real-time data, atmospheric interference, and resolution constraints that affect timely and accurate decision-making, remote sensing faces different challenges in disaster management. Moreover, high costs, data processing complexity, and sensor limitations hinder rapid analysis and effective disaster response. Selecting criteria is the most important, as well as a complex task to be done through evaluation with extreme consideration. The following criteria are based on a range of publications and resources on the difficulties associated with remote sensing in disaster management. The final decision on the collection of criteria will be finalised through deliberations of wise DMs. </p>
      
        <sec>
          
            <title>5.1. Data resolution and accuracy ($\boldsymbol{c_1}$)</title>
          
          <p>Data resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>] and its accuracy are vital in remote sensing. They regulate the comprehensiveness, accuracy and reliability of the information used in disaster management. Spatial resolution mainly helps in classifying small features such as dented buildings or flood-affected areas. On the other hand, temporal resolution ensures timely warnings during disasters as well as frequent monitoring for updates. Again, spectral resolution allows the identification of particular conditions, such as moisture levels in burned areas, and radiometric resolution increases the ability to detect subtle changes in intensity. High accuracy ensures that mapped locations and measurements truly represent ground reality. Together, high-quality resolution and accuracy enable rapid assessment, precise mutilation estimation and effective decision-making supporting all phases of disaster management preparedness, early warning, response, and recovery. </p>

            <title>5.2. Limited real-time data availability ($\boldsymbol{c_2}$)</title>
          
          <p>Limited real-time data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>] availability remains a major challenge in the use of remote sensing for effective disaster management. The main reason for this is that satellite revision times and sensor delays often pose significant barriers to the timely capture of rapidly changing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>]. Various natural barriers, such as cloud cover, atmospheric disturbances, and technological limitations, can further limit access to immediate data at critical moments. Moreover, high-resolution real-time imagery is very expensive and not always accessible to all agencies, creating gaps in monitoring. Data processing and transmission bottlenecks create difficulties in emergency situations by slowing down rapid interpretation. This reduces situational awareness and limits the effectiveness of early warning. Overall, the lack of immediate, continuous data undermines decision-making during the preparation, response, and recovery phases, making it crucial. </p>

            <title>5.3. High cost of data and technology ($\boldsymbol{c_3}$)</title>
          
          <p>The high cost of data and technology poses a significant challenge in effectively using remote sensing at all stages of disaster management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>]. Advanced sensors, high-resolution imagery, and dedicated satellites require high financial investments. Developing countries have to bear the premium datasets required for accurate monitoring in disaster-prone areas. Data licensing, use of hardware and specialized software increase these costs and limit their accessibility. Ground station maintenance and infrastructure processing further increase these costs. Moreover, skilled personnel are also required for this work. These financial constraints delay the timely acquisition and analysis of necessary information. As a result, DMs rely on low-quality data, which reduces the accuracy of disaster assessments. Ultimately, high costs limit the widespread and equitable use of remote sensing for effective disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, making it important. </p>

            <title>5.4. Lack of technical expertise and infrastructure ($\boldsymbol{c_4}$)</title>
          
          <p>The effective use of remote sensing at all stages of disaster management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>] is severely hampered by a lack of infrastructure and technical knowledge, as specialist personnel are required to operate sensors, manage complex datasets and interpret imagery accurately. Many regions lack trained personnel due to high costs, leading to delays and errors in data analysis. Various inadequate infrastructures, such as limited computing power, inadequate internet connectivity, and outdated software, severely limit the smooth operation of large remote sensing datasets. These are hampered by the lack of proper training and equipment. This gap weakens early warning systems and hampers rapid response. This is a long-term plan, which also affects post-disaster recovery assessments. Finally, limited expertise and weak infrastructure reduce the reliability and efficiency of remote sensing in supporting disaster-related decisions, so it is necessary to consider this. </p>

      <title>6. Alternative as different in disaster management phase</title>
      <p>Remote sensing is crucial in disaster management as it provides rapid, accurate information for hazard assessment and large-scale monitoring of affected areas. Its timely information helps in better decision-making at the preparation, response, recovery and mitigation stages. Different options at each stage of disaster management, such as prediction and early warning, preparation, response, recovery, mitigation, etc., help DMs choose the most effective strategy for risk reduction. The five options are discussed in detail below. </p>

            <title>6.1. Disaster prediction and early warning ($\boldsymbol{d_1}$)</title>
          
          <p>Disaster forecasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>] and early warning through remote sensing play a vital role in disaster management at all levels. These satellites and sensors provide continuous monitoring of environmental patterns. Moreover, changes in weather, land conditions and ocean parameters are detected, which remote sensing can predict hazards such as cyclones, floods, droughts and landslides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">66</xref>]. This timely forecasting can issue early warnings to the authorities. And, therefore, communities can be prepared in advance. In many cases, it is seen that high-resolution imagery signals emerging threats, and rapid detection of these anomalies becomes necessary. Moreover, remote sensing also enhances situational awareness during disasters, which is much needed. Subsequently, it helps to refine future forecasting models by assessing the impacts. In simple terms, it improves reaction, recuperation, and readiness by making proactive, well-informed judgements.</p>

          <p>By offering precise baseline data on sensitive locations, population distribution, and climatic conditions, remote sensing-assisted disaster preparedness is essential to all stages of disaster management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>]. High-resolution satellite data helps identify risk zones for floods, landslides, cyclones, and wildfires, enabling better planning and resource allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>]. Mapping evacuation routes, shelter locations, and vital infrastructure is made easier with the help of remote sensing. Continuous monitoring allows authorities to track changes in land use, vegetation, and water bodies that may increase future risks. These insights help develop effective preparedness plans and mitigation strategies. Training and drills can be improved using realistic remote sensing–based simulations. So, remote sensing improves community preparedness and lessens possible effects prior to a disaster. </p>

          <p>Remote sensing-assisted disaster response is essential for crisis management, as satellite and aircraft imagery provide rapid, comprehensive assessments of impacted areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>]. Remote sensing helps identify damaged infrastructure, blocked roads, flooded zones, and areas requiring immediate rescue. It makes it possible for rescuers to effectively deploy relief teams and prioritise resources. Real-time or near-real-time data improves situational awareness when ground access is limited or dangerous. Thermal and radar sensors assist in locating survivors, monitoring fires, and tracking ongoing hazards. Remote sensing also supports communication and coordination among agencies by offering a common visual reference. These capabilities significantly speed up decision-making during critical hours. All things considered, it improves precision, security, and efficiency throughout the catastrophe response stage.</p>

          <p>In order to restore impacted areas and lower future risks, remote sensing-assisted disaster recovery and mitigation are essential. Post-disaster imagery helps assess the extent of damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and natural resources, enabling accurate planning for reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>]. Remote sensing tracks changes in land use, soil moisture, and vegetation recovery, guiding long-term restoration efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>]. It also identifies hazard-prone zones that require structural improvements or relocation. Authorities can assess the success of prior mitigation efforts by comparing data collected before and after the event. Remote sensing supports designing better flood control systems, landslide prevention structures, and resilient infrastructure. These insights strengthen community resilience and reduce vulnerability to future disasters. In general, it guarantees well-informed choices for both long-term mitigation planning and recovery. </p>

First, we evaluate the criteria weights using the MEREC method and rank the alternatives using the MABAC method. The numerical computations were processed as follows:</p><p>The weight of the criteria is determined by using the MEREC technique, as discussed in Section 4.1 under the BTFN environment, described in Section 3. The dataset is considered from the decision matrices given by three DMs and presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. The decision matrices <inline-formula>

The Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>] and the Combined Compromise Solution method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">73</xref>] are two MCDM-based ranking methods that were invented by Zavadskas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>] in 2012 and Yazdani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>] in 2019, respectively.

          <p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_11">Table 11</xref>, we can easily see that the ranking of the alternatives remains unchanged across three MCDM-based ranking methodologies. This implies that the ranking of the alternatives for evaluating different challenges in remote sensing across all phases of disaster management is optimal compared to the different methods. Therefore, Disaster Recovery and Mitigation <inline-formula>

      <title>10. Research implication</title>
      <p>Remote sensing primarily faces challenges such as limited spatial and temporal resolution and delays in data availability due to cloud cover. This helps to limit timely hazard detection. Furthermore, sensor variability, accuracy issues, and difficulty in integrating multi-source information reduce reliability at the disaster stage. Furthermore, high cost and the requirement of technical expertise hinder its effective use. Therefore, the difficulties in using remote sensing to effectively deal with disasters at each specific stage have significant research implications in various fields, such as:</p><p>1. Advanced hazard mapping and risk assessment as needed: High-resolution, multi-temporal satellite and sky imagery creates more accurate exposure and enables vulnerability maps to improve pre-incident risk modelling and planning. </p><p>2. Evidence-based rapid emergency response: The flood of near-real-time optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data after a natural disaster helps in rapid mapping of the extent of damage. This, in turn, allows for prioritization of rescue, which is crucial for resource allocation.</p><p> 3. Improved monitoring during reconstruction and recovery: Longitudinal remote sensing records help researchers measure the trajectory of damage recovery. Additionally, remote sensing reconstruction results can be used to identify secondary hazards, such as erosion and vegetation loss. </p><p>4. AI, fusion, and near-real-time analytics are catalysts for new approaches: The connection of remote sensing with machine learning, data fusion (where, multi-sensor, in-situ and GIS) and cloud processing makes the research methodology more automated, leading to scalable disaster analysis.</p><p>5. In terms of validity, quality and reproducibility requirements: Remote-sensing results need to be credible in the context of high-level decisions. In that case, a robust research campaign is needed to standardize benchmarking data, validation protocols, and reproducibility. </p><p>6. Research implications for policy and decision-support phenomena: Translational research is urgently needed to transform remote sensing outputs into actionable decisions, increasing communication during times of uncertainty, efficient workflows, and increasing local capacity. </p>

      <title>11. Conclusions and future research scope</title>
      <p>Despite its great potential, remote sensing still faces obstacles such as resolution limitations, data latency, and environmental constraints, which somewhat reduce its effectiveness in disaster management. In addition, integration challenges and sensor inaccuracies make reliable multi-source analysis at all stages very difficult. Additional costs, infrastructure, and technological capability gaps greatly limit its operational use. Therefore, in times of widespread disasters, it is imperative to address these obstacles to fully utilize remote sensing as a timely, accurate, and effective tool for management. The challenges of remote sensing, which plays a crucial role in all stages of disaster management, are complex, as they involve many conflicting criteria.</p><p>In our problem, we want to find the most important criteria and determine an accurate ranking of different disaster mitigation options.

</inline-formula>(D_1)$” rank first in this research work.</p><p>There are some limitations or constraints of this study which help to expand this work in future research. The scope of possible future research is discussed below, i.e.:</p><p>1. We select four criteria with four alternative types to process this problem. We may consider many other criteria and alternatives in future.</p><p>2. More disaster mitigation processes and important criteria can be adopted for future analysis. We may expand our overall dataset to ensure exact results.</p><p>3. Many other MCDM techniques can be used to determine criterion weights and rank alternatives.</p><p>4. Various fuzzy numbers, such as triangular, trapezoidal, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, intuitionistic, etc., can be considered to reflect the ambiguity of data collection. Furthermore, various de-fuzzification processes can also be considered to obfuscate the considered fuzzy numbers.</p><p>5. For comparative and sensitivity analysis of the proposed model, more cases may be taken in future studies.</p>
