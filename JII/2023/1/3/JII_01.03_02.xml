      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Since the inception of the First Industrial Revolution, various inventions and methodologies have emerged to enhance both the quality of life and efficiency of work. Innovations have evolved from the rudimentary steam engine to intricate, almost fully-automated intralogistic processes. In contemporary times, material processing activities are predominantly automated, enabling personnel to manage intricate technological processes across industries more effectively. Rapid technological advancements necessitate that businesses adapt to advanced solutions to remain competitive. A high frequency of changes characterizes this era, driven by unpredictable customer demands. The primary focus has shifted towards producing user-friendly, functional, and high-quality products to meet user specifications, encompassing not only tangible products but also information, energy, and services. The integration of Industry 4.0's “smart” devices, supported by the Internet, ensures products and services are consistently and readily available, indicating an enhancement in both intralogistics and customer service activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>In fiercely competitive markets, numerous companies have endeavored to elucidate how Industry 4.0 can bolster sustainability across production, logistics, and various other processes. This multifaceted explanation of the concept of Industry 4.0 has made it challenging to discern a universally accepted interpretation. However, in 2015, a significant stride towards establishing a common conceptual framework was made by a consortium of German experts. Their publication, “Design principles for Industry 4.0 scenarios: A literature review”, highlighted four pivotal elements of the digital revolution: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and the Smart Factory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. A majority of the research regards these technologies as foundational. Other technologies, such as Digital Twin (DT), 3D printing, robotic systems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), among others, are perceived as extensions of these foundational elements, vital for realizing processes within the smart factory paradigm to deliver sustainable products and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>As technological innovations have matured, initial foundational technologies have been superseded by advanced counterparts including Big Data and analytics, Autonomous robots, Simulation, Horizontal and vertical system integration, IIoT, Cyber Security, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing, and Augmented Reality. Studies have indicated that smart factory processes often falter due to an orientation towards tailoring products based on user demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Consequently, this study aims to delineate the significance of specific Industry 4.0 technologies concerning their role in the seamless functioning of all processes within a smart factory. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the interconnectedness of Industry 4.0 technologies from the aspect of the smart factory concept, where their direct and indirect influence on this modern concept is indicated. Following this introduction, a brief overview of the industrial revolution is provided, focusing on the transition from traditional manufacturing to smart factories.

      <title>2. The evolution of the industrial revolution and the advent of the smart factory</title>
      <p>The commencement of the industrial revolution remains a debated topic among scholars due to the multitude of economic and social transformations that accompanied it. The origins of the First Industrial Revolution during the 18th century are most frequently associated with Great Britain, subsequently spreading to Western Europe and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Such alterations have been largely attributed to significant advancements in science, technique, technology, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), ranging from the first industrial revolution—defined largely by the advent of the steam engine—to the present era of Industry 4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>The introduction of the steam engine, a paramount technological innovation, found its implementation in production and intralogistics operations. During its early adoption, production processes were managed traditionally, often localized. However, even during these nascent stages, certain ICT-related inventions were observed to enhance user services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The subsequent Second Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, often termed the Technological Revolution, witnessed a proliferation of technological innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. This era was significantly shaped by Tesla's contributions, particularly in the realms of efficient electricity transmission, AC motors, and other technological applications that substantially augmented production processes. It was during this period that production process management began displaying elements of globalization. Concurrently, intralogistics gained prominence due to the emergence of innovative transportation modalities, vehicles, and material handling solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>Dubbed the Digital Revolution, the Third Industrial Revolution was characterized primarily by the ubiquitous nature of the computer—a tool now integral to contemporary society. This wave of digitization prominently permeated sectors such as telecommunications, music, film, and photography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. By the 1970s, a marked emphasis was placed on addressing the evolving consumer demands, leading to an expanded array of products and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Production process management during this phase exhibited the zenith of globalization, with exponential interconnectivity observed amongst companies, suppliers, customers, and other global entities, facilitated by cutting-edge ICT solutions like IoT, DT, 3D printing, and other Industry 4.0 technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Postulations suggest that the inception of the “smart factory” concept occurred during this period, becoming a cornerstone for the ecological, economic, and social sustainability of supply chain operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Given the exponential trajectory of advancements in science, technique, and technology, the 21st century is awash with novel technologies, permeating both professional and personal spheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>It has been posited that the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0, operates concurrently with the tail end of Industry 3.0. This era emphasizes the need for comprehensive computerization, robotization, and automation in production. The term “Industry 4.0” was first formally introduced in Germany in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Subsequent terminologies such as Logistics 4.0, Supply Chain 4.0, and Warehousing 4.0, among others, have also emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Innovations in the past decade have redefined various facets of modern life, with the prevalent introduction of “smart” devices and technologies in daily use, culminating in what is referred to as the “smart environment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Given these advancements, it can be deduced that the smart factory concept, within the context of Industry 4.0, stands as a pivotal technological component for enhancing consumer advantages. Since a smart factory constitutes a singular entity in the supply chain, the integration of contemporary Industry 4.0 technologies remains imperative for sustainable customer service.</p><p>Industry 4.0 is delineated by the intelligent networking of industrial machinery and processes that rely on CPS, wherein embedded networked systems are employed for intelligent control. Historically, Industry 4.0 has been perceived as a technology-driven shift, primarily targeting enhanced manufacturing efficiency. As part of a high-tech governmental initiative, it was devised to bolster Germany's global competitiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. The metamorphosis of CPS into Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) is foundational to Industry 4.0, with the Smart Factory emerging as a pivotal initiative therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Yet, inherent challenges permeate Industry 4.0. The potential for a systemic overhaul of the prevailing operational modalities of Europe's (and by extension, the world's) industrial economy presents itself. A significant challenge lies in dissociating the consumption of natural resources from their deleterious impacts on the environment, climate, and societal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Several dimensions characterize this evolution:</p><p>• The shift towards a circular economy, underpinned by regenerative industrial transformation practices. This ensures that all supply chain entities accrue economic benefits while adhering to sustainability tenets.</p><p>• A requisite emphasis on social sustainability. This mandates enhancements in employee welfare, ensuring their inclusive societal integration, and the deployment of technologies that augment rather than supplant human capabilities.</p><p>• The ecological dimension, which is implicitly characterized by transformative endeavors that phase out fossil fuel dependency, augment energy efficiency, harness nature-based solutions, rejuvenate carbon sinks, bolster biodiversity, and conceive novel avenues for socio-economic development, cognizant of natural ecosystem interdependencies.</p><p>It has been observed that contemporary civilization remains anchored in the second industrial revolution's paradigms. The depletion of fossil reserves, pivotal energy sources, and essential raw materials, compounded with environmental degradation, signals an acute planetary crisis. Consequently, Industry 5.0 emerges as a strategic imperative, informed by its foundational principles, offering a roadmap to navigate this exigency. Departing from the narrowly defined technological focus of Industry 4.0, predominantly centered on digitalization and digital technologies, Industry 5.0 introduces a holistic spectrum, imbuing the paradigm with a richer, multi-faceted significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. From this perspective, the Smart Factory is identified as a linchpin, instrumental in pivoting the application of advanced Industry 4.0 technologies towards environmental and societal sustainability. A thorough comprehension and integration of the CPS concept become indispensable, laying the groundwork for the seamless orchestration of smart factory operations. Subsequent sections will elucidate the principles of CPS, establishing a foundation to explore the sustainable constructs and processes inherent to the Smart Factory paradigm.</p>

      <title>3. Specificities of the smart factory paradigm</title>
      <p>With the advent of Industry 4.0, prevailing business models and management paradigms have been subjected to notable modifications and enhancements. Concurrently, a transition from historical manufacturing methodologies and interactions with supplier entities has been observed. An integral outcome of this transformation is the emergence of the “smart factory” concept. At its core, this advanced technology, aimed at streamlining production and intralogistics processes, is characterized by the ability to establish an autonomous smart network with self-regulation, optimizing underlying processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>The term “smart factory” is postulated as a theoretical production solution encompassing automation, wherein a synergy of software, hardware, and, in certain instances, mechanics, seeks production optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Such a paradigm is synonymous with the reduction of superfluous human intervention and minimization of resource wastage. In these settings, activities spanning both the digital and tangible realms become intricately intertwined, rendering intralogistics operations within Industry 4.0 smart factories considerably intricate. Intralogistics is understood as overseeing the control, execution, and enhancement of internal material movement, information flow, and goods management across sectors, including business, commerce, and governance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>With the integration of nascent Industry 4.0 technologies in warehouses and distribution centers, the demands placed upon smart factories have amplified. These encompass parameters such as speed, accuracy, precision, flexibility, and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Consequently, heightened emphasis is being placed on refining and transforming production processes. This positions the “smart factory” paradigm as pivotal for the seamless operation of sustainable supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Moreover, leveraging technologies such as the IoT, CPS, and Big Data, this contemporary, adaptable production model can be integrated with analogous systems across global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Manufacturing systems of the third industrial revolution are recognized as foundational elements in the paradigm of Industry 4.0. Traditional manufacturing, characterized by robotization, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), 3D printing, among other prevailing technologies, formed a cornerstone of the vast majority of factories operating within the confines of Industry 3.0. However, with the advent of Industry 4.0, innovative technologies such as the IoT, CPS, DT, and Cloud Computing have been introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].

            <title>4.1. The pivotal role of iot in the smart factory framework</title>
          
          <p>In the evolution of Industry 4.0, myriad solutions have been established within the realm of information exchange. It is posited that the bedrock for the seamless attainment of customer requisites in this environment hinges upon digitization, with a notable emphasis on computer networking. Contemporary supply chains, it has been observed, stand incapacitated without the trifecta of swift, dependable, and fortified Internet connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>Central to the progression and execution of the Industry 4.0 paradigm is the IoT. This phenomenon is defined as a comprehensive network framework intertwining tangible entities with their digital counterparts via amassed data and sophisticated communication tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Integral to this infrastructure are the ever-evolving networks and the Internet. Optimal, fortified, and unerring linkages among all chain stakeholders are deemed pivotal, not merely as a manifestation of the supply chain's architecture but also as an enabler of efficacious customer service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. For the seamless orchestration of information among suppliers, industries, distribution nodes, and end-users, such connectivity becomes indispensable. Through the deployment of IoT-fueled “smart” apparatus and systems, supply chains are discerned to undergo an “intellectual metamorphosis” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Central to a resilient supply chain is the notion of the “smart factory”. This construct leverages rapid information dissemination and process automation, surpassing the capabilities of erstwhile business templates. Through the lens of voluminous data, aggregated both by industrial-grade and conventional IoT coupled with cloud technologies, prognostications of machinery malfunctions become feasible, paving the way for curtailed unscheduled downtimes and cost efficiencies. From such observations, it might be inferred that the essence of a smart factory lies in its aggregation of “intelligent” components, with IoT as its linchpin.</p><p>While the pertinence of IoT to the digitized operations of Industry 3.0 factories has been underscored, its multifaceted utility within the smart factory paradigm emerges as a conduit for the sustainability and efficiency of supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Distinct functionalities facilitated by IoT technology include:</p><p>• Real-time tracking and localization of commodities, enabling the exploration of alternative trajectories, potentially leading to expedited product delivery to consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>• The caliber of products, be it during fabrication, transit, or storage phases, is subjected to meticulous scrutiny via specific IoT instruments, ensuring timely interventions to optimize processes and elevate product quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>• Ambient conditions of storage facilities and transportation mediums undergo vigilant surveillance through IoT contrivances, warranting product integrity by preempting potential damages or delivery aberrations.</p><p>• Contingency planning stands enhanced, as real-time monitoring by IoT tools identifies prospective vulnerabilities, reinforcing supply chain robustness, especially under adverse environmental scenarios.</p><p>• Prophylactic upkeep of assets is facilitated as data relayed from embedded devices within smart factory machinery interfaces with auxiliary software, detecting imminent operational anomalies.</p><p>• Traditional manual procedures, such as data cataloging and paper-based tagging, have been superseded by IoT devices, predominantly RFID tags, engendering unparalleled transparency in inventory management, thereby bolstering operational efficiency across the supply chain spectrum.</p><p>While the adoption of IoT within the smart factory framework is observed to bestow transformative advantages encompassing production cost optimization, heightened energy thriftiness, and adept information governance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], its practical implementation is not devoid of challenges. An examination of pertinent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] unveils several barriers to the seamless integration of this technology:</p><p>• Technological Dependence: It has been reported that an overreliance on technology can be a double-edged sword. In scenarios where technological challenges or risks are encountered, the deployment and utilization of IoT-centric devices often become contingent upon the provision of robust and rigorously-tested support mechanisms.</p><p>• Privacy and Security Concerns: Enhanced information transparency, a hallmark of advanced ICT, while offering manifold benefits, simultaneously ushers in concerns related to information security. The increased accessibility of data, unfortunately, often inversely correlates with its safeguarding. Unintended exchanges of confidential or incorrect information can ensue due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders in data dissemination processes.</p><p>• Human Capital Implications: A pronounced shift towards an elevated IKT platform, mandating comprehensive IoT integration, invariably impacts employment dynamics within smart factories. It has been noted that there's an observable reduction in roles that previously entailed manual labor. While potential mitigation strategies encompass employee requalification and training, the evolving landscape invariably demands heightened IT proficiency and specialized software skills. A niche for IoT specialists, tailored specifically for smart factory operations, is discernibly emerging.</p><p>• Implementation Complexities: The introduction of avant-garde IKT solutions necessitates the confluence of compatible hardware, refined software, and a trained workforce. Moreover, a societal dimension, often labeled as the “apprehension towards novelty”, further complicates the implementation matrix, especially for nascent IoT-related innovations.</p><p>In light of these challenges, it becomes evident that while the potential benefits of IoT in smart factories are manifold, stakeholders must be cognizant of the intrinsic complexities and address them proactively to realize the full spectrum of advantages.</p>

            <title>4.2. The criticality of iiot within smart factory operations</title>
          
          <p>Smart factories are conceptualized as advanced embodiments of manufacturing, where the efficacious networking of components is paramount, taking into account evolving consumer demands and ensuring supply chain sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Consequently, the imperative nature of discerning the appropriate technological choice, its setup, and the merits of IIoT and cloud paradigms cannot be overstated.</p><p>The IIoT is characterized as a conglomerate of intelligent devices connected to systems for monitoring, data acquisition, exchange, and analysis. Within the spectrum of industrial operations and processing, IIoT is postulated to be an essential subset of the overarching IoT framework, particularly evident in its applicability to smart factories, vital to sustainable supply chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>The diverse capabilities endowed by IIoT systems are witnessed across the entirety of the product lifecycle. The spectrum of these benefits is expansive, ranging from nuances of product design to intricate inventory tracking within supply chains. A notable implication of IIoT integration is the facilitation of preventive maintenance. Data accrued through IIoT mechanisms are postulated to substantially curtail production halt frequencies – a pervasive challenge in certain industries. Such a proactive approach not only mitigates downtime but also augments productivity by signaling forthcoming equipment maintenance needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Further advancements, facilitated by IIoT, encompass remote management capabilities, enabling personnel to interface with machinery, thereby providing distanced support. This, juxtaposed with the efficient oversight of machinery, and the incorporation of cutting-edge software, is deemed more efficient than conventional manufacturing methods. The ensuing benefits are manifested as cost efficiencies and enhanced responsiveness to consumer prerequisites – advantages predominantly driven by IIoT-mediated remote control.</p><p>The structural composition of IIoT closely mirrors its IoT counterpart, and can be demarcated into the subsequent segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]:</p><p>• Network of Devices: This encapsulates intelligent apparatuses and sensors, including but not limited to temperature and pressure sensors, humidity detectors, and RFID tags. These entities are integral to the data acquisition essential for smart factory operations.</p><p>• Gateway: Comprising diverse networks, protocols, and methodologies pertinent to smart factory processes.</p><p>• Cloud Computing: The technological bedrock for real-time data capture, processing, management, and storage, with further elucidation provided in Section 4.2.</p><p>• Analytics: This module, often regarded as an intrinsic facet of cloud computing, is dedicated to data analysis, serving to distill actionable insights.</p><p>• User Interface: Representing the system's tangible facet, it enhances the synergy between smart factory operations and its end-users.</p><p>Given the pivotal role of IoT and IIoT technologies in augmenting the efficiency and sustainability of smart factories, a comprehensive comparative analysis, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, is deemed essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. While IIoT is recognized as a subset of the broader IoT framework, its distinguishing feature lies in its emphasis on interconnecting machinery and devices across sectors, including manufacturing, healthcare, and multifaceted logistic undertakings such as transshipment, packaging, and warehouse operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. In contrast, IoT is commonly affiliated with an array of “smart” devices permeating daily life – encompassing appliances like refrigerators and air conditioners. The application purview of these technological constructs is elucidated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>. A myriad of attributes, from flexibility to overarching objectives, delineates the nuances differentiating IIoT from IoT.

The transition from conventional manufacturing paradigms to state-of-the-art production methodologies has culminated in CPS, elucidating the precursory constructs of the contemporary smart factory. Supporting this paradigm shift are the pioneering technologies of Industry 4.0, predominantly IoT, IIoT, and Cloud computing. Even amidst the deceleration in production growth catalyzed by global perturbations, the proliferation of smart factories, buttressed by IIoT and cloud infrastructures, has been noted. While IoT's deployment is prevalently observed across supply chain entities, facilitating seamless real-time information dissemination, IIoT's application is pinpointed more towards bolstering industrial resilience and enhancing sustainability.</p><p>The present study was undertaken with the intent to elucidate the significance of the smart factory within the tapestry of a sustainable supply chain. A comprehensive discussion encompassed the merits, constraints, and challenges associated with the adoption of IoT, IIoT, and Cloud computing, delineating their pivotal roles in the smart factory schematic. Concurrently, a distinction between IoT and IIoT, in terms of their respective functionalities, roles, and relevance, not just within the smart factory framework but across the entire supply chain, was established. As future avenues of exploration beckon, several prospective enhancements beckon. Investigations into the smart factory's role in curtailing product manufacturing durations and optimizing logistics expenditures could offer insights into the supply chain's enhanced efficiency and competitiveness. Further inquiry might encompass the assessment of agility in accommodating evolving user stipulations, especially during ongoing manufacturing processes. Lastly, the adaptability and versatility of IoT, IIoT, and Cloud Computing, both within and beyond the smart factory paradigm, warrant extensive scrutiny, particularly concerning their implications on the broader supply chain dynamism.</p>
