      <abstract><p>The precision of determining rock mass mechanical parameters is notably impacted by mining blast activities. An advanced method for inverse analysis of these parameters, predicated upon measured blasting vibrations, has been developed. This approach employs a meticulous recognition of initial P-wave and S-wave arrivals within the vibrational energy spectrum. Utilizing principles from elastic wave theory, a novel framework has been established, correlating P-wave and S-wave velocities with dynamic characteristics of rock masses. The efficacy of this method has been substantiated through practical implementation, particularly in the Guanbaoshan Open-pit Iron Mine, Liaoning Province. Here, the derived density ratios were observed to range between 0.98 and 1.01, aligning closely with figures provided by authoritative research institutes. Additionally, the dynamic-to-static Poisson's ratio exhibited variations from 0.85 to 1.03, while the modulus of elasticity ratio dynamically to statically spanned from 2.0 to 2.6. These results, falling within anticipated theoretical ranges, underscore the robust applicability and accuracy of this method. The research contributes significantly to the domain of mining operations, particularly in optimizing blasting processes and enhancing the precision of mechanical parameter acquisition. It presents a pioneering approach, essential for addressing similar challenges in the mining sector.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The accurate assessment of rock mass mechanical parameters is quite critical for the effective planning and implementation of blasting operations. Inverse analysis methodologies have emerged as a pivotal tool in the computation of dynamic parameters of rock masses in blasting zones, contributing significantly to the refinement of blasting techniques, cost efficiency, and precision in execution.</p><p>Presently, the predominant methods for inverse analysis of rock mass mechanical parameters encompass experimental approaches, application of empirical formulas, and ultrasonic testing techniques. Experimental approaches are bifurcated into laboratory tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], where rock samples from project sites are examined to ascertain mechanical parameters such as tensile and compressive strength through static experiments. However, this method may not adequately represent the rock structure in blasting areas. Conversely, in-situ tests aim to surmount the limitations of laboratory tests by objectively mirroring the mechanical characteristics of rocks in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], albeit at a higher cost and complexity.</p><p>In the realm of theoretical and empirical research, scholars globally have made strides in estimating mechanical parameters of rock masses in blasting zones. Ivars et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] introduced the synthetic rock mass (SRM) technology, facilitating the simulation of jointed rock masses and enabling the creation of models that encapsulate the spatial distribution of rock mass joints for numerical calculation of mechanical parameters. Chun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] leveraged the rock mass rating (RMR) system to analyze field data for deriving the mechanical parameters of the site-specific rock mass. Furthermore, Zhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] formulated equations that establish a correlation between rock quality designation (RQD) and rock mass mechanical parameters, drawing on extensive field data.</p><p>Ultrasonic testing methods have been identified as providing rapid inverse calculation of mechanical parameters in blasting areas, with advanced processing of blasting vibration waveforms enhancing signal fidelity. It was found by Huang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] that acoustic waves, during their propagation, carry substantial information, the alteration of which can reflect the physical and mechanical properties of rock masses. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm, introduced by Dragomiretskiy and Zosso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], achieves adaptive signal frequency domain separation, effectively mitigating mode mixing and splitting phenomena, and has gained widespread application in signal decomposition. In pursuit of enhanced prediction accuracy for peak blasting vibration velocity, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] devised a sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimized back propagation (BP) neural network model, addressing the limitations of traditional BP neural network models in avoiding local optima. Similarly, Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] proposed a signal denoising and smoothing model based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), establishing an objective function predicated on filtering algorithm similarity and smoothness for optimal solution calculation.</p><p>Sarkar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] conducted measurements of various rock properties, such as density, slake durability index, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), and P-wave velocity. These measurements underpinned the establishment of a correlation between P-wave velocity and rock mechanical properties, thus facilitating the determination of rock mechanical parameters via ultrasonic testing. Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] explored acoustic emission (AE) effects and failure characteristics of sandstone under varying confining pressures through uniaxial and triaxial compression acoustic emission tests. Their findings indicated a decrease in fractal dimension with increased confining pressure, suggesting a higher orderliness in rock failure. Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] employed a cube-cluster model to effectively characterize the spatial correlation of scattered AE events in granite samples during the rock failure process under triaxial compression conditions.</p><p>Further advancements were made by Lawal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], who proposed predictive models utilizing gene expression programming (GEP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and sine cosine algorithm optimized artificial neural network (SCA-ANN) for ground vibrations from blasting in granite quarries. Additionally, Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] developed a hybrid denoising method combining local mean decomposition (LMD), multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE), and singular value decomposition (SVD), significantly enhancing denoising efficiency.</p><p>Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] employed a novel signal smoothing denoising model, integrating optimal variational mode decomposition (OVMD) with multiscale permutation entropy (MPE). Through the analysis of both simulated and actual engineering signals, it was demonstrated that this model is proficient in accurately identifying signal frequency information. The primary two components were shown to effectively represent the significant elements of the superimposed signal, proving particularly adept for high-precision data sequence analysis, feature extraction, and denoising, with a no<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_22">table 22</xref>.05\% improvement in denoising error over the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-MPE model. Sun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] introduced the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm, which incorporates adaptive noise signals into empirical mode decomposition (EMD). This innovation was found to effectively counter the inherent mode mixing issue inherent in EMD, enhancing the time-frequency analysis precision of seismic wave signals resulting from blast-induced ground vibrations. Moreover, Sun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] proposed a frequency slice wavelet transform-Fourier decomposition method (FSWT-FDM) for blasting vibration signals. This method, which combines FDM with FSWT, reduces ineffective signal components during decomposition, offering new perspectives for analyzing vibration signals in open-pit mining blasting. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], in their analysis of open-pit slope blasting vibration tests, utilized the principal empirical mode decomposition (PEMD) method to eliminate noise in vibration signals, effectively revealing the frequency spectrum characteristics of slope blasting vibration signals at various elevations.</p><p>In summation, the predominant focus of current research is on ultrasonic testing and empirical formulae for the inversion of rock mass mechanical parameters and the processing of blasting vibration signals. However, there remains a paucity of studies that integrate blasting vibration signals with the mechanical properties of mine rocks for parameter inversion. Most existing methods rely on sample collection for mechanical parameter testing, which may not comprehensively represent regional rock mass characteristics. This study, employing initial arrival recognition methods for P-waves and S-waves within vibration signal energy and integrating elastic wave theory, deduces expressions linking P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity to rock mass dynamic parameters. Consequently, it introduces an inverse analysis method for these parameters based on blasting vibration signals. Applied in the Liaoning Province's Guanbaoshan Open-pit Iron Mine, this method has been proven to yield rational and reliable rock mass dynamic parameters, significantly elevating blasting efficiency and reducing associated costs.</p>

            <title>2.1. Recognition of p-wave initial arrival</title>
          
          <p>The identification of the initial arrival of P-waves in blasting vibration signals is a critical aspect of rock mass dynamic parameter analysis. Commonly implemented techniques, such as the short-term average/long-term average (STA/LTA) method, spectral analysis, and pattern recognition, primarily focus on specific signal aspects. Nonetheless, their efficacy is limited when applied to complex, non-stationary signals like those generated by blasting vibrations. A notable characteristic of these signals is that the energy parameter variations around the P-wave initial arrival are more distinct than amplitude fluctuations, thus providing a more reliable identification marker.</p><p>In response to these challenges, a novel approach for P-wave initial arrival recognition, based on the energy of vibration signals, has been developed. This method incorporates the processing of trend items in blasting vibration signals and introduces the envelope derivative operator (EDO). EDO effectively amalgamates frequency domain information with the time-varying envelope of the signal, demonstrating superior capacity in tracking instantaneous changes in the signal. This characteristic renders it particularly effective for accurately demodulating signals, even in environments with substantial noise, thereby making it apt for processing non-stationary blasting vibration signals. The computational steps for the EDO involve the following:</p>

          <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, both the TK operator and EDO exhibit proficient tracking capabilities for energy changes within the signal. However, at certain extremal points, the TK operator yields negative values due to its modulation term, leading to singular values in subsequent energy separation processes. In contrast, the EDO demonstrates advantageous non-negative characteristics. The total energy of the blasting vibration wave can be quantified as:</p>

The STA/LTA method involves computing the energy of the vibration within designated long and short calculation windows to pinpoint the P-wave's onset. The formula for the STA/LTA calculation is as follows:</p>

          <p>Following the precise identification of the P-wave's initial arrival, the recognition of S-waves, particularly within an engineering context, often encounters challenges due to the interference of P-wave tails and ambient noise, factors influenced by propagation distance and site conditions. This research advances the understanding of S-wave recognition by comparing the physical properties of P-waves and S-waves to ascertain the initial arrival time of S-waves in measured blasting vibration waves. A critical factor in analyzing P-waves and S-waves is the calculation window width. The relationship between this window width and the dominant frequency of P-waves is generally expressed as:</p>

            <title>3.1. Recognition of p-wave initial arrival</title>
          
          <p>The propagation of blasting vibration waves through rock mass media imparts key insights into the dynamic parameters of the rock, such as vibration velocity, frequency, duration, and waveform. These parameters are intricately influenced by the rock's mechanical properties. Additionally, the propagation process itself carries vital physical information pertinent to these mechanical characteristics. An analysis of the measured blasting vibration signals further elucidates the rock mass's elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density. According to elastic wave theory, the correlation between P-wave and S-wave velocities and the dynamic parameters of the rock mass is established as follows:</p>

Extensive research by scholars globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] has delved into the correlation between density and P-wave velocity. It has been observed that different types of rock masses exhibit diverse functional relationships between density and P-wave velocity, attributable to their distinct properties. Commonly, Gardner's empirical formula, introduced in 1974, is employed in these assessments:</p>

          <p>A field experiment was conducted at the 285m level in the Guanbaoshan project, Liaoning Province. Area A, the focus of the blasting operation, was a rock region comprising 81 blastholes. The holes were spaced 6.0 m apart, with a row spacing of 4.2 m. A delay time of 17 ms was implemented, with hole depths varying between 14.0 m and 15.6 m. The maximum charge per hole was set at 202 kg, resulting in a total designed charge of 15044 kg. The objective of the study was to deduce the challenges associated with blasting in the subsequent area B, through the analysis of vibration conditions in area A. Eight measurement points were strategically placed on-site, distanced 8-10 m apart, along the central line of blasting area B, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

          <p>The methods outlined earlier for identifying the initial arrivals of P-waves and S-waves were applied to the vibration waveform data collected. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> displays the identification results for the initial arrival times of P-waves and S-waves at each measuring point. Additionally, this paper presents the characteristic function curves for the recognition of P-waves and S-waves in the blasting vibration waveform at a representative measuring point, point 4\#, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>.</p>

          <p>The P-wave velocity in blast area B varied from 4.856 km/s to 5.442 km/s, and the S-wave velocity ranged from 2.927 km/s to 3.273 km/s, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>. Ultrasonic measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>) showed P-wave velocities varying from 5.075 km/s to 5.639 km/s, and S-wave velocities from 3.081 km/s to 3.443 km/s. The average errors between the P-wave and S-wave velocities obtained from the measured blasting vibration signal waveforms and those measured by ultrasonics were 4.67% and 4.74%, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>. This level of accuracy confirms that the method is suitable for practical engineering applications.</p>

The density derived from the waveform inversion, relative to the density value provided by the Anshan Iron and Steel Group Mining Design Institute, exhibited a comparative ratio of 0.98 to 1.01. The dynamic elastic modulus of the rock mass, ascertained from waveform inversion, ranged from 53 to 69 GPa, in contrast to the institute's recommended static elastic modulus of 26 GPa, yielding a comparative ratio of 2.0 to 2.6. These inversion results fall within the anticipated dynamic-static modulus ratio range of 2.2 to 2.9, substantiating the viability of deducing rock mass mechanical parameters from blasting vibration signal waveforms.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study has addressed the gap in studies focusing on the inversion of mechanical parameters of rock masses within blasting areas using field blasting vibration data. Previously, methods predominantly revolved around sample collection for mechanical parameter testing without an in-depth analysis of the rock mass properties in the measured area. This paper has investigated the disparities in frequency, deflection angle, polarization, and energy between P-waves and S-waves in blasting vibration signals. Expressions for recognizing the initial arrivals of P-waves and S-waves have been derived, and based on elastic wave theory, the dynamic interplay between P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, and the dynamic parameters of the rock mass has been analyzed. This approach offers an improved representation of the variations in frequency, energy, and deflection angle around the initial arrival time of S-waves. The key findings and prospects of this study are as follows:</p><p>Firstly, the average relative error between the P-wave and S-wave velocities, as recognized from the blasting vibration signal waveforms and those measured by ultrasonics in the field, is 4.67\% and 4.74\% respectively. These values fall within the acceptable range for engineering applications, underscoring the method's practical feasibility.</p><p>Secondly, by incorporating elastic wave theory, a relationship has been established between P-wave and S-wave velocities from blasting vibrations and the dynamic parameters of the rock mass. The proposed method, premised on the recognition of initial arrivals of P-waves and S-waves, inverts the dynamic parameters of rock from blasting vibration signals. Engineering practice demonstrates that the inverted density values approximate those provided by the research institute, with a comparative ratio of 0.98 to 1.01; the dynamic-static Poisson's ratio comparative ratio is 0.85 to 1.03; and the dynamic-static modulus of elasticity comparative ratio is 2.0 to 2.6. These inversion results align with prior research, validating the reliability and applicability of the dynamic parameters of the rock mass obtained through this method.</p><p>Finally, the influence of surface waves on the accuracy of P-wave and S-wave recognition was not examined in this paper, potentially affecting the results. The signal pickup process may inadvertently capture noise, and classifying the initial motion of P-waves and S-waves could be subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the assumption that the blasting area represents an isotropic continuous medium, without considering the presence of joints, fractures, and other conditions within the rock mass, may introduce errors in the study of inverting the dynamic parameters using P-wave and S-wave velocities.</p>
