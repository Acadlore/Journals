      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent decades, large-capacity, long-distance power grids have been widely used to meet growing electricity demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Due to the nature of the distributed energy which is fluctuating and intermittent and the continuous seeking for the high conditions of living, the electrical network has encountered several difficulties. Lack of management of particular power outages could lead to accidents and other serious consequences, finally leading to a big outage in the network. A smart grid provides an ultimate solution for long-term development of the electrical network system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. It is expected that the smart grid will transform the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity by adopting two-way working of electrical energy and data transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the smart grid is capable of improving the existing power grids through the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy sources. These types of sources are more environmentally friendly compared to traditional sources of energy such as fossil fuels which are usually utilized in a large portion of the production of electricity. Moreover, these new units of generation can be compacted and small in size and can be located close to the load centers. For these reasons, the reliability of the system can be improved and the transmission power losses can be minimized, but this adds more complexity to the structure of the power system.</p><p>The distributed generation units are small in size and located in different areas which are close to the centers of the loads, and they contribute to improving the reliability of the network. Despite increasing the flexibility and reliability of the existing network, it can lead to a more complicated system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>In terms of functionality, the smart grid is classified into transmission and distribution systems. There is several equipment, such as generators, connecting with each other by high-voltage transmission lines. Therefore, a failure in a single component or generating unit will not have a big influence on the whole transmission system. On the other hand, any failure in a single component of the distribution system could have a huge negative impact on the function of the whole distribution system due to the radial scheme of the scheme.</p><p>In this study, a comprehensive review of the recent published works was conducted. The main opportunities and challenges for implementing the smart grid were summarized. The background of smart grid and the motivations for the network operators for converting the conventional grid to smart grid were outlined in general and specifically for Kurdistan grid. The necessary comparison between the conventional and smart grids was studied. The required characteristics along with the architecture of the smart grid were addressed. At the end, the main benefits of the smart grid were mentioned as a part of the motivation factor for implementing the smart grid.</p>

      <title>3. Background and motivations</title>
      <p>The technology of smart grid has transformed the power system in developed regions, particularly Europe and the United States, to ensure eco-friendly operation. The use of renewable resources for distributed generation and the implementation of energy conservation initiatives for long-term ecological sustainability are the main factors behind this shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>]. As a result, the developing and underdeveloped nations are confronting energy difficulties and are unable to efficiently exploit their internal energy resources for maintainable economic development. Therefore, it is essential for these countries to embrace modern technologies that align with the nature of their electric networks. A variety of approaches make the smart grid a comprehensive one. Therefore, it is essential to assess the feasibility for the implementation of the smart grid in the Kurdistan region electric network.</p><p>A clear path can be established once baseline studies identify the key requirements and their expected outcomes, which provides procedure guidance and organizing milestones in line with the desired future outcomes. The expected advantages of the smart grid were explained based on the international standards.</p><p>The electrical power system in the Kurdistan region has encountered several issues. The high cost of power generation, power losses and the recent controlling and monitoring system are some obstacles to the current grid. There is a significant increase in energy demand due to the rapid urbanization and fast growth of population. Moreover, in terms of reliability and power supply quality, the poor conditions of the existing network lead to the fact that the power supply is unable to reach the demand. The demand load is always higher than the supplied load. For these reasons, a more reliable and flexible power system is required in order to supply power to the industrial, residential and commercial sectors. Due to the mentioned reasons and economic reasons, there is a huge energy crisis in the region.</p><p>However, the Kurdistan region of Iraq is blessed to have a huge quantity of natural resources, such as natural gas and renewable energy sources, despite the mentioned obstacles. As a developing country, the region faces several obstacles in fully implementing smart energy policies. Some of the major constraints include a lack of start-up capital for building government-level renewable distributed power plants, a lack of financing options for consumers to build their own distributed electricity generation systems, inadequate infrastructure for transporting energy over long distances, energy theft problems, and circular debt in the electricity department, and a lack of public awareness about the economic benefits of these policies.</p><p>Implementing smart grid in the Kurdistan region will assist the ministry of electricity to overcome many issues such as power losses, grid reliability, and operation cost, thereby meeting the increasing demand. Regarding the reduction in power losses, the contribution of distributed generation will have a positive impact on loss minimization and voltage profile improvement. Although implementing this project requires a high initial cost, this cost will be paid off in the long term as the losses will decrease significantly along with the operational cost. In addition to a reduction of technical power losses, the non-technical losses will be reduced to a minimum level by using highly accurate digital energy meters and the monitoring system. As a result, the reliability of the system will be improved and the customers will be subject to less interruption of power supply.</p>

          <p>The total energy demand in Duhok city areas is very high because of the significant increase in the number of consumers. The number of consumers has increased from 72,000 in 1999 to 385,000 in 2021. In addition to the rapid increase in the population, the majority of consumers use electricity for heating and other purposes, which also causes the rapid rise of electricity demand. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the increase in the number of consumers.</p>

          <p>The current grid's reliability is being challenged by numerous elements, including the congestion of the grid, larger energy transfers over longer distances, aging infrastructure, insufficient investment in maintenance, rising consumption of electrical energy, peak power demand, and the growing utilization of distributed resources. The growth of nations is affected by power shortages. The conventional power system is less effective due to a lack of investment in technological advancements and infrastructure enhancements, as well as the continued adoption of traditional methods of operation and upkeep.</p><p>The significant environmental impacts of the conventional power system are attributed to the substantial release of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly reduced by combining sustainable energy sources and distributed generation. To achieve this integration, it is necessary to monitor and exert greater control over the existing networks. This requires the installation of technological systems for transferring information and communication. The smart grid may take some time to integrate multiple services into the existing electrical networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">55</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">56</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>]. The block diagram for the grid of the Kurdistan region is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

            </fig>
          
          <p>The services and developments of the Kurdistan electricity sector are almost entirely dependent on the government budget allocations. There is an excessive gap between costs and revenues in the electricity sector, which becomes a heavy burden for the government budget. In addition, there is a high amount of losses in the existing system, mostly non-technical losses. Low tariffs and no energy conservation measures exist. This contributes towards uncontrolled demand growth as well as a shortage of capital investments to procure additional generation capacity and to upgrade transmission and distribution networks to meet existing and future demands. On the other hand, the risks associated with the constraints on capital investments include deterioration of existing electricity infrastructure services and inability to cope with future demand growth. Under these circumstances, the electricity sector should prioritize the following actions:</p><p>• Making the Kurdistan electricity sector independent and self-reliant.</p><p>• Bridging the gap between costs and revenues. </p><p>• Reducing losses.</p><p>• Contorting the growth in electricity demand.</p><p>• Attracting the private sector to make investments in the electricity sector.</p><p>• Restructuring and reforming the electricity sector.</p><p>The above-mentioned requirements can be satisfied by converting the current grid to the smart grid.</p>

      <title>7. Benefits of the smart grid</title>
      <p>Smart grid implementation in Kurdistan will bring about numerous benefits, as previously mentioned. One common issue faced is the exceeding of the maximum generation limit by the total load demand, resulting in planned load shedding. However, utility engineers and experts suggest that this demand deficiency can be addressed in urban areas through peak load shaving and efficient utilization of the existing power supply. The advantages of implementing the smart grid for Kurdistan are as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">73</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>]:</p><p>• Environmental benefits: A smart grid can contribute to saving thousands of lives, particularly those who prioritize human well-being. Additionally, it can help alleviate the negative impact of polluted air on asthma and lung diseases, especially among vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly.</p><p>• Lower utility bills with user-friendly tools: Smart meters provide consumers with valuable information on their energy usage and prices through simple online displays. By utilizing set-and-forget home energy management tools, consumers have the ability to make choices to reduce their bills and minimize their environmental impact.</p><p>• Growth of economy and employment: There has been rapid expansion of the clean energy industry and the attraction of investment from different foundations. These investments are concentrated mainly on domestic companies and projects in solar energy, wind energy, energy efficiency, smart grids and EVs, leading to the growth of the economy and employment.</p><p>• Reliability improvement and outage reduction: In the presence of a smart grid which includes sensors and communication systems, the issues can be identified and cleared prior to their occurrence. In case of the power outage, it can be restored quickly, which allows the consumers to use uninterrupted power supply so that they don’t feel the outage power impact.</p><p>• A large amount of clean and renewable energy can be used with the presence of the smart grid, which reduces the dependence of dirty energy sources such as fossil fuels. This technology not only decreases the need for using fossil fuels but also reduces the negative impact of using energy on the environment. Moreover, implementing a smart grid can reduce air pollution. In addition, the smart grid simplifies the transition to clean EVs by enabling smart charging during the night, while wind energy is available and cost-effective. This method mitigates effectively another main source of harmful air pollution.</p>

      <title>8. Challenges for implementing the smart grid</title>
      <p>The implementation of the smart grid encounters several challenges, such as the huge investment costs, the privacy and cybersecurity challenges, and the operation complexity.</p>
      
        <sec>
          
            <title>8.1. Investment costs</title>
          
          <p>a) Infrastructure of communications and smart meters</p><p>It requires huge investments to build the infrastructure for the smart grid in terms of communication systems and digital smart meters. All the existing energy meters need to be replaced with smart meters and the smart meters need to be installed for all distribution transformers and feeders. The smart grid is two-way, which means that the data and the complete feedback from the consumers need to be sent to the control center, and that a communication system needs to be built, which leads to more costs to build the smart grid system.</p><p>b) Grid protection</p><p>The conventional protection system for the power network is centralized and needs to be upgraded to ensure proper operation of the protection devices. More switches and other protection devices need to be added to the system and proper settings need to be applied.</p><p>c) Storage systems</p><p>Converting the conventional grid to a smart one includes penetration of renewable energy into the network, which increases the complexity of the grid and brings new challenges. These include momentary interruptions in the energy supply caused by factors such as cloud cover reducing solar power generation or fluctuations in wind speed. Additionally, continuous fluctuations in demand occur, influenced by the time of day and seasonal variations. Therefore, the stored energy is needed in order to cover the momentary lack of power supply. The energy storage adds extra costs to the total cost of the smart grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>].</p>

            <title>8.2. Data management</title>
          
          <p>Converting the network from the traditional grid to a smart one adds more complexity to the system as a good smart grid consists of several renewable sources. The infrastructure of the grid becomes more critical and susceptible to faults once converted to smart grid. It collects data every 2-5 seconds, whereas advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems collect data every 1-15 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>].</p><p>a) Standards and interoperability;</p><p>b) Massive data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>].</p>

            <title>8.3. Stability and decreased flexibility</title>
          
          <p>The primary operational challenge faced by the smart grid is ensuring grid stability. The role of synchronous generators in ensuring power system stability has always been crucial. The generators contribute to the grid by supplying inertia, droop control, and reactive power compensation. The increase in the proportion of renewable energy in power generation leads to a decrease in the dependence on synchronous machines, creating new stability issues for the power grid.</p><p>The network operator should assess and predict the grid stability under different operating conditions. One of the factors in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the smart grid is its ability to keep the system stable. Various kinds of stability aspects are as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>]:</p><p>• Frequency stability: It is the capability of the system to keep the frequency within the acceptable and standard limit, which is 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on the system frequency after subjecting to abnormal conditions.</p><p>• Voltage stability: It is the system’s ability to maintain its voltage within the permissible and predefined limit after being subjected to a disturbance.</p><p>• Dynamic stability: This represents the ability of the network to keep or recover after being subjected to disturbances that lasts for long periods of time.</p><p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> illustrates the common obstacles of the smart grid and the methods for overcoming these obstacles.</p>

      <title>9. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study outlines the major challenges and opportunities for establishing a smart grid and illustrates the main differences between the smart grid and a conventional one. According to the review conducted, a significant investment is required to build the infrastructure of the network system and complete the ongoing advanced metering system, thereby supporting the technology of the smart grid application. Converting the conventional grid to a smart one requires establishing clear and applicable regulations. In addition, the threats of cybersecurity need to be clearly addressed. The required funding needs to be guaranteed for establishing the smart grid. It has been shown that there is a serious issue for the Kurdistan grid. The entire system is under the threat of deterioration and correct measurements need to be conducted. The power loss percentage is high. In addition, there is a large gap between the costs of generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the related incomes. This adds extra loads to the budget of the local government. Therefore, it is essential to take actions in order to stabilize the network, reduce the losses and minimize the costs of the electricity. It has been demonstrated that implementing the smart grid can mitigate several issues, such as reduction of power losses and minimization of the power outages.</p>
