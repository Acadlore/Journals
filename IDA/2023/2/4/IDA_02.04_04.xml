      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Recent advancements in the field of IoT-based cow health monitoring have been the subject of extensive research. This section collates and discusses various strategies identified in the literature for monitoring cow health using IoT technologies. A pivotal development in this area is the implementation of the Narrow-Band Internet of Things Communications (NB-IoT) platform, fundamental to an estrus detection system for cows. This technology, aimed at identifying significant changes in cows' physical conditions, facilitates timely estrus status recognition, thereby alerting farm administrators. The adoption of such technology has been observed to mitigate the workload on staff and augment the economic efficacy of pastures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Additionally, an insightful study integrates IoT with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance cattle health monitoring systems. This research not only describes existing cattle health monitoring architectures but also critically evaluates the challenges faced. Based on this evaluation, it proposes potential modifications to enhance future iterations of these systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Another noteworthy innovation is the "MOOnitor", an intelligent IoT device designed for livestock tracking. This neck-mounted gadget represents a significant step forward in livestock management technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>The exploration of IoT-based systems for cow health management has yielded diverse and innovative solutions. A system combining health monitoring, disease detection, and management of ailing cows through IoT and intelligent system technologies has been developed. This system integrates monitoring and detection functionalities into a unified application, significantly enhancing farm management efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Further advancements are highlighted, where a proposed system allows farmers continuous online access to monitor vital parameters of each cattle, including body temperature, heart rate, humidity, and posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. The cow disease prediction (CDP) method, a component of the LiveCare architecture, has been introduced as an unsupervised multiclass classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Additionally, collar devices are employed for tracking cattle health, collecting data on body temperature, heart rate, and movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], thus facilitating proactive health management.</p><p>An innovative real-time cattle health monitoring system based on IoT has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], employing wearable collars and IoT sensors. This approach enhances the efficiency of livestock management. Similarly, an IoT-based cloud-based Livestock Management System (LMS) is suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], offering a comprehensive solution for tracking and monitoring animal health. An IoT-based system designed to identify cattle ailments and issue alerts for animals requiring assistance has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. This system is pivotal in ensuring timely veterinary intervention. Lastly, a system capable of wirelessly storing data and monitoring and analyzing an animal's health has been created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], representing a significant advancement in the field of livestock health technology. The scope of IoT applications in cattle health and activity monitoring continues to expand, as evidenced by recent studies. The CattleCare technology, an IoT-based innovation, plays a crucial role in monitoring the health and activities of cattle. This technology incorporates the "Cattle Activity Prediction" algorithm, which classifies cattle behavior, thus aiding in the detection of behavioral changes and other health-related aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. A notable development in this field is a system designed for tracking cattle movement and predicting their locations, effectively monitoring animals along set perimeters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. </p><p>Additionally, the utilization of the Digital Smart Collar has been proposed for real-time tracking of cattle growth and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. This device represents a significant leap in monitoring technologies, offering continuous health assessment. Further, a multi-sensor board specifically engineered to monitor various biological parameters, such as skin body temperature and heart rate, has been introduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. This system underscores the importance of multi-faceted health monitoring in cattle. Moreover, a system has been constructed for regular health checks of dairy cows, with the aim of identifying diseases through symptomatic behavioral changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. The integration of IoT and machine learning in estimating cow health status has been explored, highlighting the use of various wearable devices and sensors for precise livestock management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. This approach exemplifies the fusion of advanced technologies in enhancing cattle health monitoring. Lastly, a model employing Arduino-based sensors for disease identification in cattle has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], reflecting the ongoing evolution of sensor technology in livestock health management.</p>

      <p>The hierarchy consists of three primary components. Firstly, the applications of IoT in cow health monitoring encompass monitoring, control, and tracking of bovine health conditions. Secondly, sensors and devices, often integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), play a pivotal role in gathering essential data by sensing and tracking multiple health-related parameters. Finally, communication protocols such as ZigBee, RFID, Bluetooth, and WiFi are instrumental in transmitting the data collected by these sensors and monitoring devices for user analysis.</p>

      <title>6. Future research directions</title>
      <p>The transformation of the livestock industry through the application of IoT in monitoring the health of cows and other cattle presents a promising research avenue. The development of miniature, wireless sensors for the continuous monitoring of health indicators such as heart rate, body temperature, and digestive activity emerges as a crucial area of focus. The integration of advanced data analytics, underpinned by machine learning and AI, holds the potential for precise health predictions and early disease detection, thereby enhancing livestock management efficiency.</p>
