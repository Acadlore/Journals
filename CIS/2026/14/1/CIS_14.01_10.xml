      <abstract><p>This study proposed a socio-technical model to transform the national food system in Indonesia toward greater inclusiveness and sustainability. By integrating circular supply chain management (CSCM), macro-ergonomics, and human factors, the research examined how interactions among key stakeholders such as farmers, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), consumers, and government shaped sustainability and equity outcomes. A mixed-methods approach combining thematic analysis (TA), social network analysis (SNA), and agent-based modelling (ABM) was employed to identify structural bottlenecks and leverage points for systemic change. Qualitative insights informed network structures and behavioral rules within the simulation model. The results indicated that MSMEs and consumers exerted strong systemic influence on behavioral change and redistribution potential despite their peripheral network positions, while government actors, though structurally powerful, exhibited limited embeddedness in day-to-day interactions. Simulation scenarios demonstrated that integrated interventions combining policy enforcement, education, and technology incentives yielded the greatest improvements, including reductions in food loss and waste (FLW), greater equity, and improved sustainability performance. The proposed interdisciplinary framework provides actionable guidance for policy design and system reconfiguration in emerging economies which are facing challenges from the complex food system.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The global food system is undergoing unprecedented stress due to a confluence of environmental, social, economic, and technological challenges. Climate change is disrupting agricultural cycles, reducing yields, and exacerbating food insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">El Bilali et al., 2021</xref>). Simultaneously, the global population is projected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, thus intensifying the demand for food while increasing pressure on already-depleted natural resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Purnomo et al., 2024</xref>). The sustainability of food systems was further compromised by social inequality, fragile governance, urban sprawl, and the exponential growth of global food waste estimated to be over 1.3 billion tons per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Bonilla Cedrez et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the dominant linear model of food production and consumption, characterized by the “take-make-dispose” pattern, has proven inefficient and environmentally destructive to call for a paradigm shift toward circularity and inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">da Silva Duarte et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the context of Indonesia, the situation is both unique and urgent. As an archipelagic nation with one of the world’s largest agricultural populations and food markets, Indonesia faces a paradox: while rich in biodiversity and food-producing regions, it grapples with rising food insecurity, post-harvest losses, fragmented supply chains, and unequal access to markets and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Syahlani et al., 2024</xref>). Integrated, adaptive, and inclusive supply chain governance has not yet kept pace with the rapid urbanization and digitalization of food services (e.g., food delivery platforms). Furthermore, Indonesia has some of the highest rates of food loss and waste (FLW) in Southeast Asia, contributing to both nutritional deficiencies and environmental degradation. These issues are compounded by the marginalization of smallholder farmers and informal food actors, weak institutional coordination, and a lack of systemic approaches that combine infrastructure, policy, and behavior change.</p><p>Against this backdrop, this study argued for the socio-technical transformation of Indonesia’s national food system through the integration of circular supply chain management (CSCM), macro-ergonomic principles, and human-centered design. The socio-technical perspective recognizes that food systems are not only shaped by technologies and institutions but also by the dynamic interactions among human actors, organizational structures, cultural norms, and environmental constraints. Through embedding macro-ergonomics and human factors into CSCM, this study aims to ensure that transitions of the food system are not only ecologically sustainable and economically viable but also socially just and participatory.</p>

            <title>1.1. Problem statement and aim of the research</title>
          
          <p>The necessity of this research stems from a lack of holistic and interdisciplinary models that address the technical and social complexities of Indonesia’s food system. Existing policy frameworks often focus on isolated interventions such as agricultural subsidies and digitalization, without addressing systemic inefficiencies or empowering key actors including farmers, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and consumers. Furthermore, few studies to date have operationalized socio-technical models with computational tools such as social network analysis (SNA) and agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate policy scenarios and behavioral feedback loops within the food system.</p><p>This study therefore seeks to fill these gaps by pursuing the following research objectives:</p><p>To map and analyze the structural dynamics of the Indonesian food system using SNA, in order to identify key actors, bottlenecks, and leverage points.To employ ABM to develop a scenario-based simulation model that accurately depicts the behavioral, institutional, and environmental dynamics of a circular food supply chain.To create a comprehensive framework that integrates CSCM, macro-ergonomics, and human factors to improve the inclusivity, sustainability, and resilience of the national food system.</p><p>The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary integration of CSCM, ergonomics, and behavioral systems modeling. This approach remains largely underexplored in the literature on food systems, particularly within Southeast Asia. By coupling qualitative thematic insights with quantitative network and agent-based simulations, the study offered both diagnostic and predictive capabilities for food system reform. Furthermore, having emphasized inclusivity and socio-technical fit, the model has practical relevance for policy innovation, stakeholder engagement, and regional adaptation, thus offering a potentially scalable blueprint for other developing countries facing similar challenges in the food system.</p>

      <title>2. Methodological approach</title>
      <p>To address the multidimensional and socio-technical nature of the national food system in Indonesia, this study employed an integrative methodological framework that combined qualitative thematic analysis (TA), social network mapping, and simulation-based modeling. The approach was designed to ensure both depth of understanding and system-level insight across three core dimensions, i.e., structure, behavior, and interaction.</p><p>The methodology unfolded in four key phases:</p><p>TA—to extract emergent issues, perceptions, and contextual themes from stakeholders.SNA—to map and measure the structural properties and relational dynamics of the food system.ABM—to simulate policy and behavioral scenarios in a virtual system representing real-world complexities.</p><p>The integration of the framework aligned the findings with CSCM, macro-ergonomics, and principles of human factors, resulting in a practical model ready for application.</p>

            <title>2.1. Thematic analysis</title>
          
          <p>TA was conducted to identify key socio-technical challenges and behavioral patterns from qualitative data. The data were collected from semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and field observations involving multiple stakeholders in the food system (e.g., farmers, MSMEs, government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and consumers).</p><p>The corpus of the qualitative data consisted of 32 semi-structured interviews involving key stakeholder groups: smallholder farmers (10); MSMEs in food processing and distribution (8); government officials at local and national levels (6); NGO representatives (4); and consumers (4). Data collection was conducted between March and August 2024 across three regions representing western, central, and eastern Indonesia (Java, Sulawesi, and Sumatra). Information from policy documents, institutional reports, and field observations complemented interview records.</p><p>All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed via a six-step thematic coding procedure following Braun and Clarke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ahmad et al., 2024</xref>). Initial open coding was conducted independently by two researchers to identify salient concepts. Codes were then iteratively refined, clustered into higher-order themes, and reviewed through expert validation to ensure consistency, credibility, and analytical rigor.</p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> the emerging themes are:</p><p><p>Limited access to circular technology and infrastructure;</p><p>Weak consumer awareness of food sustainability;</p><p>Marginalization of smallholders and MSMEs;</p><p>Incoherent and fragmented regulatory framework; and</p><p>Cultural norms leading to food overconsumption and waste.</p></p>

            <title>4.1. Interpretation of findings from social network analysis</title>
          
          <p>The SNA reveals a fragmented food system structure in which influence is not determined solely by formal authority or direct connectivity. MSMEs and consumers emerge as influential actors despite their peripheral structural positions, thus indicating that systemic influence operates through indirect and second-order connections rather than through centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Lin et al., 2024</xref>). Their proximity to highly connected institutional actors permit them to shape behavioral norms, market responses, and redistribution dynamics across the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Hamam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>This apparent paradox reflects an important socio-technical characteristic of complex food systems: actors positioned outside formal governance hierarchies can still exert substantial influence when embedded in relationally powerful networks. MSMEs function as adaptive intermediaries that translate consumer demand into operational changes, thereby accelerating the diffusion of circular practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Alonso-Adame et al., 2024</xref>). Consumers, through collective behavioral shifts, indirectly pressure upstream actors to adopt more sustainable practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">El Bilali et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Government actors, while central in the structure, display limited embeddedness in everyday interactions within the network. This suggests that regulatory authority alone is insufficient to drive transformation unless coupled with active engagement and coordination with non-state actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Hasyimi et al., 2024</xref>). NGOs and cooperatives play a critical bridging role by connecting grassroots actors with institutional support, thus reinforcing the importance of hybrid governance arrangements for transformation to inclusive food system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Gustafson et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

            <title>4.2. Interpretation of results from agent-based modelling</title>
          
          <p>The agent-based simulations indicate that meaningful system-level improvements arise from the interaction of multiple policy levers rather than isolated interventions. Integrated scenarios generate reinforcing feedback loops among consumer behavior, MSME innovation, and institutional responsiveness, to enable non-linear gains in sustainability performance and equity outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Vuthi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral adaptation emerges as a key driver of system transformation. Increased awareness among consumers strengthens demand-side signals, hence encouraging MSMEs to invest in circular technologies and waste reduction practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Denicolai et al., 2021</xref>). These changes, in turn, enhance the stability of the overall system and reinforce institutional commitment, hence illustrating how social learning and imitation processes amplify policy impacts over a long period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Shishvan &amp;amp; Benndorf, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, single-lever interventions tend to produce diminishing returns due to structural constraints and delayed behavioral responses. The simulation highlights the importance of coordinated policy design that simultaneously addresses technological capacity, regulatory alignment, and human behavior to overcome systemic inertia and lock-in effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Diakosavvas &amp;amp; Frezal, 2019</xref>).</p>

            <title>4.3. Theoretical implications</title>
          
          <p>This research built on and extended the theoretical framework of CSCM by embedding it in a socio-technical system. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Farooque et al. (2022)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Mahmoud et al. (2025)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Park et al. (2024)</xref> highlighted the role of CSCM in reducing environmental impact, this study revealed that the success of CSCM was mediated by actor behavior, institutional dynamics, and social learning as these were dimensions often overlooked in traditional supply chain literature.</p><p>The incorporation of macro-ergonomics into food systems aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Scheer et al. (2022)</xref>, who emphasized the importance of designing systems that fit both organizational structures and human capabilities. This is particularly relevant in the context of food systems, where local practices, labor conditions, and cultural values must be harmonized with sustainability objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Caron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Esposito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Fortunati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Richardson &amp;amp; Fernqvist, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Varzakas &amp;amp; Smaoui, 2024</xref>).</p><p>The application of ABM for the human-centered design in food systems remains relatively rare. However, studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Mabey et al. (2023)</xref> provided precedent for the use of ABM to simulate behavioral complexity in socio-environmental contexts. This research contributes by operationalizing such complexity through an actor-based circular food system model, rendering it more practical for policy and design purposes.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrated that integrating TA, SNA, and ABM provided convergent evidence of the dynamics in Indonesia’s food system. The results showed that the system was fragmented yet remained highly transformable.</p><p>Qualitative analysis identified persistent challenges, including limited technology and infrastructure, low consumer literacy, socio-economic disparities, regulatory gaps, weak collaboration, and entrenched cultural behaviors. These themes correspond to a sparse and modular network structure in which government and NGOs act as critical brokers. MSMEs and consumers exert notable influence despite their peripheral positions, while farmers and cooperatives form clusters with limited market feedback.</p><p>Simulation results confirmed that single-lever policy interventions yielded only incremental improvements. In contrast, a combined intervention package involving technology subsidies, regulatory enforcement, and education (S5) produced the most substantial outcomes. These included significant reductions in FLW, higher adoption of circular practices, and improved equity and stakeholder satisfaction. The improvements were driven by reinforcing demand–innovation loops and institutional feedback mechanisms.</p><p>The findings extended circular supply chain theory by explicitly embedding behavioral dynamics, institutional relationships, and social learning processes. In addition, the study foregrounded the role of macro-ergonomics in ensuring alignment between human capabilities and system design. Key priorities for food system transformation include empowering MSMEs and cooperatives, activating consumers as agents of change, bridging farmers with markets, incentivizing circular practices, and decentralizing implementation. Together, these strategies support progress toward SDGs 2, 12, and 13.</p>

      <title>6. Recommendations</title>
      <p>This research provided the following recommendations: (i) adopt an integrated S5-style package by combining technology subsidies, regulatory enforcement, and consumer education while strengthening cooperatives/NGOs as bridging actors among farmers, MSMEs, and consumers; (ii) close last-mile logistics and literacy gaps (micro cold-chain hubs, traceability, “waste-wise” labeling, and digital nudges); (iii) introduce circularity incentives (tax credits, green procurement, and phased FLW reporting); and (iv) decentralize delivery to village-owned enterprises (BUMDes) and cooperatives with performance-based flexible funding. </p><p>Phase roll-out: 0–6 months (tech grants, campaigns, open data dashboard with ABM-in-the-loop), 6–18 months (regulatory sandbox, farm-to-table e-logistics, and cooperative capacity building), 18–36 months (institutionalize green procurement and scale nationally). </p><p>Track core KPIs (FLW ↓ toward ~40% by 36 months, circular adoption ≥50%, rising equity and satisfaction) and network metrics (more cross-cluster ties). Mitigate risks of incentive gaming or small-actor exclusion via third-party verification, random audits, and inclusive design.</p>
