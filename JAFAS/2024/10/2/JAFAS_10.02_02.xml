      <abstract><p>The study aims to examine the current state of property tax administration in Zimbabwean local authorities under the conditions of digitalization. Property taxes within the Zimbabwean local tax system are significantly under-collected, necessitating an urgent enhancement of their contribution to local authority budgets. A quantitative research approach was adopted, collecting data through questionnaires from a target population of 60 staff members within an urban local authority. Purposive sampling was employed to select Chief Executive Officers, Heads of Departments, and staff directly involved with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Property Tax Administration, including ICT departments, accounting and finance staff, and engineering departments. Additionally, residential and commercial property owners were conveniently sampled based on availability and willingness to participate, resulting in a total sample size of 46 respondents. The findings reveal a significant positive relationship between Information Technology and property tax administration, suggesting that policymakers should prioritize digitization to enhance effective tax administration. Furthermore, control variables such as population, trade, and GDP were found to have significant relationships with tax administration in Zimbabwe. The introduction of ICTs has been shown to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of property tax administration, underscoring its critical role in the fiscal decentralization of local governments.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Revenue authorities have made significant investments in ICT projects over the course of the last 10 years to offer new and creative types of assistance to clients and to coordinate new advancements and cycles to smooth out tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Oppong, 2021</xref>). On that note, the Zimbabwe Income Authority carried out another Tax and Revenue Management System (TaRMS) on October 12, 2023, as part of the association's emphasis on working on business processes for the comfort of citizens. The consistent position taken after investigation of the ongoing framework was that there is a requirement for another framework (Public Notification Number 61 of 2023). Property tax is viewed as one of the most mind-blowing ways of improving local government income for human turn of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">World Bank, 2019</xref>). With regards to Zimbabwe, where decentralized administration is carried out, the productive organization of property tax is significant for neighborhood government income age and economical financial administration. Local charge organizations in Zimbabwe face different difficulties, including restricted authoritative limits, obsolete information in the executives’ frameworks, and wasteful assessment assortment systems. These difficulties have brought about low assessment consistency rates and diminished income streams for nearby state-run administrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Fish, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Besides, the absence of straightforwardness and responsibility in the local charge organization fuels the issue of tax avoidance and hampers income assembly endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Obayomi, 2019</xref>). Numerous nearby experts in Africa have slender financial bases, exacerbated by unfortunate base inclusion and frail organization. Moreover, the open money hypothesis recommends that the local charge is an optimal neighborhood charge. But on the other hand, it's an 'information hungry' charge, making it troublesome and exorbitant to control appropriately, particularly at the nearby government level where limits, abilities, and assets are frequently deficient. Given its high information requests, local charge organizations fit the utilization of present-day data and correspondence innovation (ICT) frameworks. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen (2018)</xref>, over the last 40 to 50 years, notwithstanding, studies have shown that frail organization is the center justification for unfortunate income execution, especially issues of information gathering and the board, absence of straightforwardness, unfortunate charging and assortment rehearses, and powerless enforcement.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen (2018)</xref> declared that "a key issue confronting revenue organizations in many emerging nations is that they operate with manual, paper-based recording systems”. According to our assessment, this is especially true for property tax assessments. Revenue leakages are common and occur due to untimely collection, corruption, and under-collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen, 2018</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen (2018)</xref> postulate that "challenges arise in assessing the number of citizens absent from their registered rolls, the number of people who are enrolled but inactive, and how much is actually being evaded through non-payments, corruption, and inadequate billing systems”. They further assert that to address these challenges and with ongoing advances in ICT, there has been a strong push for using ICT across economies to improve the efficient collection of tax revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Making a feasible framework to direct the repetitive local charge and other interior incomes in a productive and financially savvy way is fundamental if future city foundations are to be appropriately kept up with and metropolitan help levels improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen, 2018</xref>). Be that as it may, ICT can possibly change local charge organization processes, making them more productive, straightforward, and fair.</p><p>The reception of computerized stages, geographic data frameworks (GIS), information examination, and online installment frameworks can upgrade income assortment, further develop consistency rates, and strengthen general administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Prichard, 2015</xref>). Innovation driven arrangements can smooth out evaluation systems, work with property valuation, and computerize charge installment processes, prompting more compelling expense organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Moore, 2013</xref>). The digitalization of tax organizations through e-charge frameworks is obviously permitting more noteworthy sharing of information inside charge organizations and inside legislatures as an instrument for enhanced investigation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown (2021)</xref> alludes that “a main consideration for this sped up pattern is the tension presented by the coronavirus pandemic as innovation frameworks and cycles filled in as help for disturbed charge capabilities”.</p><p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">World Bank (2018)</xref>, “the term local authority signifies authoritative bodies that are formally liable for every one of the public administrations in unambiguous geological regions like urban communities, towns, districts, provinces, and sheets”. Furthermore, “neighborhood specialists are entrusted with guaranteeing arrangement and support of public administrations to nearby occupants through the usage of assets produced from the nearby networks, notwithstanding credits and awards from the focal government and different sources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">World Bank, 2018</xref>). Nearby specialists should likewise have the independence to change the level and organization of their income sources in accordance with the rationale of financial decentralization.</p>

            <title>1.1. The role of the it systems and tools in property tax administration</title>
          
          <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Occhiali et al. (2022)</xref>, IT systems provide technology support, at varying levels, to all functions of the tax administration: processing of registration filings and issuing taxpayer identification numbers (TIN); validating and processing returns, and payments received through different channels and maintaining the taxpayer's accounts. In addition, high taxes, multiple taxes, unreasonable taxes, an unfriendly attitude of tax administrators, difficulty in paying taxes, bureaucracy in paying taxes, and changes in taxes affect tax compliance behaviour for SMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown, 2021</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.2. Legal or institutional constraints in zimbabwe that impact property tax digitization</title>
          
          <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Scarpini et al. (2023)</xref>, some of the challenges that impact tax administration are inadequate number of valuers of properties, lack of awareness of taxpayers, corrupt behaviour of the officials, inadequacy in property tax administration, taxpayers’ unwillingness to pay property tax, and lack of motivation of property tax collector.</p><p>However, tax administrations face significant challenges in how to best develop their capacity to use digitized data optimally and re-align operations and skills to new digitalised operating models. First, tax administrations need to cope with inadequate funding for IT reforms, as well as challenges in the design and development of their digital platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Occhiali et al., 2022</xref>). Inadequate infrastructure and a lack of skills and resources limit the potential of digital reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown, 2021</xref>). Tax administrations grapple with ensuring an enabling environment for taxpayers to adopt technologies – and this is determined by factors beyond the tax administrators’ control, such as the availability of stable internet connections and little familiarity with IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Scarpini et al., 2023</xref>). “There are also challenges with how best to link digital tax platforms and data with those of other spheres of government, due to unresolved regulatory and confidentiality issues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Scarpini et al., 2023</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Oppong (2021)</xref> also agrees that “ICT administration projects are often complex and expensive, and it may take time to realise their benefits and savings”. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp; Franzsen (2018)</xref>, this is particularly important in an environment where purchasing a commercial off-the-shelf system (COTS) may not suit local circumstances. The business case for the introduction of ICT to undertake mass appraisal or to improve internal revenue collection should be based on sound analysis and a detailed appreciation as to how and where the benefits will arise. Furthermore, local authorities must strive to adopt resilient and sustainable IT-based revenue collection systems. For example, in Kenya and Zambia, local authorities have a degree of autonomy that would allow them to develop their own in-house ICT solutions or acquire off-the-shelf solutions. However, these approaches come with significant risks (for example, ‘lock-in’ contracts and incompatibility with other systems) and costs (for example, licenses, maintenance, and upgrading charges) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Prichard, 2015</xref>).</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>The study adopted a quantitative research approach. Data were collected using questionnaires from the target population of 60 staff of the urban local authority. Purposive sampling was applied in selecting Chief Executive Officers, Heads of Departments, and staff members who are directly involved with ICTs and Property Tax Administration from the ICT departments, accounting and finance staff, and engineering departments. Residential and commercial property owners will also be conveniently sampled depending on their availability and willingness to participate in the study. Therefore, a total sample of at least 46 respondents was targeted.</p>

            <title>3.1. Reliability analysis</title>
          
          <p>Reliability analysis refers to the stability of the measuring instruments used and their consistency over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). By standard, the Cronbach’s alpha is the best method to use for reliability examination. The alpha statistic ranges between 0 and 1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Bryman &amp;amp; Bell (2007)</xref> recommend that a minimum threshold of 0.7 be acceptable for instrument reliability.</p><p>In this study, with a view to establishing the reliability of the research instrument used, the Cronbach’s alpha statistic was computed for the 17 variables used in the research model. The results were as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. The computed Cronbach’s alpha for the 17 variables was found to be 0.996. This being greater than 0.7, it shows that there is greater internal consistency of the items in the scale, and that the research instrument used was very reliable.</p>

Therefore, the descriptive statistics were able to depict the positive effects of ICTs for property tax administration in Zimbabwe. The results are also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Zhang et al. (2022)</xref>, who attest that “there is scope to increase tax compliance and expand the tax base through enhancing the usage of ICT systems and e-government platforms to simplify tax administration, reduce compliance costs, provide convenience to taxpayers, and enhance enforcement”. It is therefore equally important that other policies be made to be supportive of the development of ICTs.</p>

              <p>The overall mean for the tax on income was 4.138, with a standard deviation of 0.866, showing individual response variations from the main mean. As such, the analysed data managed to depict the challenges of using ICTs in the administration of property taxes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Fish (2015)</xref>, the role of ICT in tax administration has faced numerous challenges, and its impact has been limited. These studies highlight the difficulties encountered in implementing ICT infrastructure for tax administration”. On the other hand, recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown (2021)</xref> emphasizes the successful development and implementation of ICT-based applications in improving tax administration in government sectors, this indicates that progress has been made in utilizing ICT tools to enhance tax processes.</p><p>In line with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown (2021)</xref> highlights that “financial constraints have resulted in the recruitment of tax officials who lack a comprehensive understanding of tax laws. This issue is further compounded by insufficient administrative staff with the necessary skills and a high level of illiteracy among taxpayers and tax collectors”. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Olaoye &amp;amp; Awe (2018)</xref> argue that the challenges faced in tax administration in underdeveloped countries primarily stem from personnel related problems. These include low wages, a lack of training, fraudulent activities by tax collectors, inefficiency, understaffing, and a lack of awareness among taxpayers regarding the importance of paying taxes.</p>

          <p>The research went further to compute the regression analysis of the study results to produce inferential statistics for use in hypothesis testing and regression equations. Efficiency, contribution, and effectiveness were the independent variables, while property tax administration was the dependent variable. A regression model summary is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>.</p><p>The coefficient of determination, or R-squared, is 0.898. The value of R-squared indicated a discovery of 80.6% of the deviations of tax administration as caused by efficiency, contribution and effectiveness. Therefore, factors not deliberated in the model account for 19.3%.</p>

The results show the relationship between the variables. The F-value is 88.505, and with 67 degrees of freedom, the test is highly significant; thus, we can assume that there is a linear relationship between the variables in the model. The significance level in the model is less than 0.05, therefore it is statistically significant in predicting how the independent variables affect the tax administration in urban local authorities.</p>

              <p>The tax base is not unresponsive. Using annual market-value assessments helps to keep the tax base up to date with such changes and would, with a uniform tax rate, generate revenues that grow with the local economy. It appears that if anything causes property tax revenues to be inelastic, it is the political decision-making in the setting of the property tax rates, a process that should reflect voters’ preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">McCluskey &amp;amp;amp; Franzsen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The findings showed that employees in the organization agreed that the property tax has increased revenue received from local government authorities. The results are also in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Moore (2013)</xref> whose study indicated that property tax contributes significantly to revenue collection, with 39% of total tax revenues realized in 2015. They were also in agreement that local government authorities make the refund process easy for property taxpayers based on income received. They also agreed that local government authorities should educate property taxpayers on tax laws and regulations to increase their income collection. </p>

              <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Yang et al. (2019)</xref> state that “ICTs influence the improvement of the quality of financial recording, which in turn decreases financial irregularities and manipulation; automatically updates ledgers; and increases accuracy, transparency, and accountability in financial matters”. These findings are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Obayomi (2019)</xref>, who stated that “a cashless economy enhances the achievement of effective and efficient financial transactions and improves financial reporting”. Similar results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Fish (2015)</xref>, who postulated that “after the introduction of ICT machines in revenue collection, there was an improvement in accuracy in property tax administration”.</p><p>The findings indicated that employees agreed that the ICT system platform is easy to use for transactions by tax administrators. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Prichard (2015)</xref>, whose findings agreed, they noted that “the tax system should be simple in nature and process; such a taxpayer may not need a technical expert to interpret it for them”.</p><p>The results of the study showed that the use of ICTs had made the administration of property taxes effective, increasing the quality and quantity of information. However, the results are in contrast with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Oppong (2021)</xref>, who disagree that a cashless economy enables to reduce cash-related fraud and promotes transparency and accountability in financial matters. Findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Brown (2021)</xref> corroborate the challenges observed in this study that the impediments in implementing ICT systems include the high costs of purchasing devices, the lack of awareness of their use, the breakdown of the system, and the lack of trust in the systems.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The study concludes that the role of ICTs is very important to local authorities. This is because ICTs have a positive effect on property tax administration. The use of ICTs in council activities, such as property tax administration, enhances effectiveness due to factors such as timely revenue collection, enhanced management integrity, and the provision of clear records, among others. Information systems also improve the operations that are facilitated by the internal control systems, which in turn improve the improve the effectiveness of the council. To increase income collection, the LGA educates potential taxpayers on tax laws and regulations. Property tax has increased income received by local government authorities. The employees agreed that property tax on income received must be established and imposed immediately for convenience when making payments.</p>

    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>6. Recommendation</title>
      <p>The study recommends further studies to determine the role of information technology in property tax administration in fiscally decentralised local government in Zimbabwe, and the focus should be on the role of the ICT system in property tax administration and in both rural and urban local authorities in Zimbabwe. This will enable the authority to assess the effectiveness, contribution, and efficiency of property administration.</p>
