      <abstract><p>Pixy, a prominent cosmetic brand, enhances personal appearance and boosts confidence. Amidst the expanding cosmetics industry and its resultant competitive landscape, this study investigates the impacts of sales promotions and product variants on impulsive buying of Pixy Lipcream. Data were collected through questionnaires distributed to 100 respondents and subsequently analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). It was found that both sales promotions and product variants significantly influence impulsive buying behavior. The findings suggest that strategic discounts, inclusion of complementary items, optimization of promotion durations, and alignment of product offerings with consumer preferences can enhance marketing effectiveness. These recommendations are poised to assist Pixy in refining their promotional strategies to secure a competitive advantage in the market. This research contributes empirical evidence to the understanding of how promotional tactics and product diversity can foster impulsive buying among consumers of cosmetic products.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Shopping is an individual activity to fulfill the needs or desires for goods and services, which, of course, is a fun activity for almost all people. The craze for shopping indicates an increase in people's ability to buy products, which further encourages high levels of consumerism and hedonism. These characteristics enable various types of industries to grow well in Indonesia.</p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, it is determined that the cosmetics industry sector has become a mainstay industry to contribute to national development. Therefore, it has the opportunity to continue to develop and grow well, along with raising public awareness regarding the importance of maintaining skin health and hygiene to support their appearance and self-confidence. The existence of favorable potential in the cosmetics industry triggers tight competitiveness between companies. Even this tightness can be proven by the ranking of the Top Brand Index which can be used as a measure of the company's success in winning the competition. One of the cosmetic brands that is quite familiar to the public is Pixy.</p><p>Pixy is a beauty product produced by PT Mandom Indonesia Tbk and is very popular in Indonesia because of its relatively affordable price and good quality. In addition, Pixy continues to innovate to create a competitive advantage as a form of competitive readiness. It is proven that until now PT Mandom Indonesia Tbk has succeeded in producing Pixy cosmetics in various product categories, ranging from skincare products, base makeup, decorative products, and product series with advantages contained in each type of product.</p><p>Despite its success in various innovations, it turns out that Pixy has not been able to make a maximum contribution to the company's net sales.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> presents information on Pixy's efforts in contributing to the company's net sales, which is still not optimal. The lack of optimal contribution is caused by a decrease in demand for Pixy products, including Lipcream products. The low demand for Pixy Lipcream products is also written in the company's annual report, which shows that decorative cosmetic products, especially lip makeup, are a significant contributor to the decline in the company’s profits. This statement is also supported by the Top Brand Index ranking, which indicates that Pixy Lipcream does not rank first. Therefore, it is assumed that the product has not achieved top of mind share, market share, or commitment share.</p>

      <p>The strategy in a more appropriate marketing program to increase the sales of Pixy Lipcream is to provide a stimulus for impulsive buying behavior to consumers as a fast sales technique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Kharis (2011)</xref> defined impulsive buying as a person's effort in shopping for a particular product or brand without planning. In accordance with interviews conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Areadi &amp;amp; Hidayat (2016)</xref>, data obtained from respondents shows that almost most consumers in modern markets have made impulsive purchases even though they only did it on a few additional items.</p><p>In relation to the formation of impulsive buying as a fast sales strategy, more aggressive sales promotions have been conducted for Pixy Lipcream to attract potential customers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Firmansyah (2018)</xref>, sales promotions directly encourage potential consumers to shop. In line with this opinion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Tjiptono (2008)</xref> explained that sales promotion was used to increase impulsive buying. When a good offer is provided through promotions, potential customers will immediately have the desire to buy the product because they do not want to miss an opportunity that is considered profitable for them.</p><p>As for the impact of sales promotions on impulsive buying, the findings of several studies are inconsistent. For example, several studies have concluded that sales promotion has a significant impact on impulsive buying, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Daulay et al. (2020)</xref> on department store consumers in Medan City, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Badgaiyan &amp;amp; Verma (2015)</xref> on retail companies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Tirtaning &amp;amp; Setiaji (2021)</xref> on marketplace consumers. Conversely, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Lestari et al. (2023)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Fauzan &amp;amp; Widarmanti (2024)</xref> has concluded that sales promotions have no impact on impulse purchases.</p><p>In addition to sales promotions, the fast-selling technique carried out by Pixy Lipcream in relation to impulsive buying is the creation of more varied products to increase the product value in the eyes of potential consumers. This statement is in line with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Koski &amp;amp; Mesiranta (2005)</xref>, which indicate that product variety is one of the most important factors influencing impulse purchases. This indicates that a wider variety of products can provide freedom for consumers to choose according to their needs, which brings profitable opportunities for the company. Therefore, this study aims to prove the formulation of the problem and explain the impact of sales promotions, product variants and their combinations on impulsive buying.</p><p>As for the impact of product variants on impulsive buying, the findings of several studies are inconsistent. For example, several studies have concluded that product variants have a significant impact on impulsive buying, such as those conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Anggraeni et al. (2016)</xref> on boutique consumers in Semarang City and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Vishella &amp;amp; Megawati (2022)</xref>. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Ni’mah &amp;amp; Hasan (2024)</xref> found that product variants had no impact on impulsive buying.</p><p>This study aims to fill this research gap by providing additional empirical evidence on the relationship between product variants, sales promotions, and impulsive buying, especially in cosmetic products in Indonesia.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Engel et al. (2012)</xref> defined consumer behavior as an activity related to the decision-making process when people want to obtain, consume, and use products or services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Mowen &amp;amp; Minor (2002)</xref> define consumer behavior as a field of science concerning the mechanisms of purchasing products or services involving various processes based on ideas or experiences. The formation of consumer behavior can be influenced by several factors, i.e., cultural, social, personal, and psychological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kotler &amp;amp; Armstrong, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Firmansyah (2018)</xref> divided consumer behavior into rational and irrational based on their shopping attitudes.</p><p>Consumer behavior theory can be used to find out and study a person's behavior towards a brand produced by a company. A company can study consumer behavior by conducting market research with the aim of increasing marketers' understanding and predicting various consumer behaviors. In other words, consumer behavior can be used as a basis for formulating an integrated marketing strategy based on opportunities and potential relevant to market conditions.</p><p>Consumer awareness of economic activities is influenced by marketing incentives and the surrounding environment, which gives rise to feelings of interest in shopping for products or services that have been marketed. This motivates the importance of studying consumer behavior theory. Consumer behavior is formed through interactions or reciprocal relationships between product producers and buyers receiving information about the products they want.</p>

          <p>Purchasing decisions are defined as the selection of two or more alternative choices by a consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Schiffman &amp;amp; Kanuk, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Tantri &amp;amp; Abdullah (2021)</xref>, consumers experience several stages before making a purchase decision, namely, need recognition, information search, alternative evaluation, purchase decisions, and post-purchase behavior.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Tarigan et al. (2019)</xref> proposed that impulsive buying is spontaneous consumer purchasing behavior without planning in a shopping center because interest in the product appears at that time. Furthermore, in line with the opinion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Wulan et al. (2019)</xref>, impulsive buying is spontaneous without prior planning due to encouragement from the shop which is motivated by the completeness of product variants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Utami (2010)</xref> stated that impulsive buying occurs because of a sudden desire in consumers to own a product quickly, which must be fulfilled at that time.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Daulay et al. (2020)</xref> explained the factors behind unplanned purchases by consumers: (a) goods with several distinctive characteristics such as relatively affordable prices, product complexity such as products in various sizes, and the need for these products; (b) unique characteristics possessed by prospective buyers such as economic conditions, surrounding environment, social class, demographic location of consumers, gender, characteristics and attitudes that exist within them; (c) the marketing strategy carried out by a company in offering its products, including expanding the distribution network, improving service quality, strengthening advertising through various media on an ongoing basis, and arranging store layouts to attract consumers.</p><p>Hawkins Stern's Impulse Buying Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Agarwal &amp;amp; Chetty, 2019</xref>) explains several factors that influence impulsive buying, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Hawkins Stern's Impulse Buying Theory provides valuable insights into situations where consumers tend to engage in impulse purchases. This theory proposes a new view of consumer buying behavior in that consumers engage in impulse buying behavior under the influence of external forces, including price and distribution, outstanding shop display, product features, service quality, and promotion strategies.</p>

(2012)</xref> proposed that the marketing mix is a fundamental concept in the field of marketing that must be understood to create an effective marketing strategy by optimizing various marketing tools. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kotler &amp;amp; Armstrong (2006)</xref>, the marketing mix consists of promotions, products, places, and prices, which provide stimulation to consumers, thereby affecting their shopping behavior. A marketing program is more effective if it combines all elements of the marketing mix to achieve marketing goals while providing value to its consumers. The implementation of the marketing mix can be used to influence consumer behavior so that it triggers them to be more interested in a product and encourages the creation of impulsive buying behavior when shopping.</p>

            <title>2.5. Sales promotions</title>
          
          <p>One effective way to attract consumers is to carry out sales promotions, which provide benefits to consumers when they purchase products or services. This means that, with an attractive sales promotion, consumers feel curious enough to try to purchase a product/service, which gives them the potential to become permanent customers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kotler &amp;amp; Keller (2007)</xref>, sales promotions are short-term, and companies want to use them to influence consumers to test or even purchase products or services. Some sales promotion strategies include giving coupons or discounts, providing free samples and product demonstrations, giving gifts and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Utami, 2008</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.6. Product variants</title>
          
          <p>Realizing the importance of paying attention to the suitability of the marketed product, a company needs to ensure that the product meets shopping expectations by looking more attractive to potential consumers. This can be realized by creating more varied products to give consumers the freedom to choose products according to their needs and desires. When a product is considered more varied, consumers are more enthusiastic about trying to determine which type of product is more suitable and in line with their expectations.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Utami (2010)</xref> defined product variants as groupings of different products in shopping centers, which gave consumers the flexibility to choose products, thereby influencing their considerations when shopping. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Oktaviani &amp;amp; Komariah (2021)</xref>, product variants are the completeness of a product that motivates consumers to be curious to try or buy according to their needs and desires. The completer and more varied a brand is, the more satisfied consumers can feel. The choices available strengthen their interest in buying the product.</p>

              <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kotler &amp;amp; Keller (2007)</xref>, companies carry out short-term sales promotions to influence consumers to test or even purchase products or services.

              <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Kotler (2008)</xref>, product variants are product diversity that distinguishes them from other products and can be seen directly by consumers when the goods are offered to them. A brand that is able to create various product variants in a more complex and diverse manner has plus points because the product is considered to meet the needs and desires of its consumers. Thus, consumers do not need to bother looking for other brands when the product they want already has a complexity of product variants that give them the freedom to make purchases. In fact, not a few consumers who often shop impulsively are tempted by the complete availability of goods offered. Therefore, it can be concluded that product variants have become one of the important factors considered by manufacturers to stimulate impulsive buying behavior to meet sales targets.</p><p>The finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Kotler (2008)</xref> is also supported by that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Vishella &amp;amp; Megawati (2022)</xref>, which indicates that product variants have a positive and significant impact on impulsive buying at CV Aladin Jaya Palembang. This finding is also supported by that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Anggraeni et al. (2016)</xref>, which indicates that product variants or diversity have a positive influence on impulsive buying, meaning that the more product variants offered to consumers, the higher the consumers' desire to make impulse purchases.</p><p>Based on the theory and results of previous research, the following research hypothesis can be formulated:</p><p><italic>H<sub>2</sub>: Product variants have a positive and significant impact on impulsive buying.</italic></p>

                <title>2.7.3 The impact of sales promotions and product variants on impulsive buying</title>
              
              <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Utami (2010)</xref>, impulsive buying occurs due to the sudden emergence of a desire in consumers to have a product immediately, which must be fulfilled right away. Their impulsive buying is also based on the stimulus from sales promotions and product variants. Various forms of sales promotions, such as discounts, providing free samples, and giving free gifts, have the potential to influence consumers to increase impulsive buying because consumers feel they can benefit more when making purchases at relatively cheaper prices.</p><p>If consumers ignore or miss sales promotions, they feel regret because they have missed a profitable offer, which motivates them to take advantage of sales promotions for impulsive buying. This also applies to product variants. When a brand has complex or more diverse product variants, it attracts consumers to make spontaneous purchases because they feel that all their needs or wants have been provided by the brand, which gives them the freedom to determine alternative choices when shopping.</p><p>This is also supported by the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Safitri &amp;amp; Nurdin (2021)</xref>, which indicates that the variables of product diversity and sales promotions have a significant influence on impulse buying of cosmetic products among students at Syiah Kuala University. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Rasuli et al. (2022)</xref> proposed that product diversity and promotions simultaneously affected unplanned purchasing decisions.</p><p>Based on previous theories and research, a research hypothesis can be formulated as follows:</p><p><italic>H<sub>3</sub>: Sales promotions and product variants simultaneously have a significant impact on impulsive buying.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> shows the hypothesis model of this study.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>As explanatory research, this study was conducted on consumers of Pixy Lipcream products in Semarang City. Semarang City is the capital of Central Java province, which covers an area of 373.8 km<sup>2</sup>. It consists of 16 sub-districts and is divided into North, South, Central, East, and West Semarang. Data was collected using questionnaires, interviews and documentation.</p><p>The sample size of this study was determined by referring to the research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Hair et al. (2017)</xref>, which indicates that the sample size generally cannot be less than 50 respondents and that the sample that should be used is 100 respondents. In the initial stage, the sample criteria were determined through purposive or judgment sampling. The individuals (a) reside in Semarang City; (b) have purchased or are using Pixy Lipcream products in the previous one to three years; (c) are more than 19 years old; (d) have made impulse purchases; (e) have used sales promotions when making purchases; and (f) are willing to fill out this research questionnaire. Furthermore, the sample unit was determined accidentally, i.e., anyone who is considered qualified as a sample was used as a research respondent.</p><p>The sales promotion variable was measured using several indicators, namely, the frequency, quality, quantity, and time of promotions, and the suitability of promotion goals. The product variant variable was measured using indicators of item availability, appearance, and product variation. The impulsive buying variable was measured using indicators of spontaneity, stimulus, and indifference to effect. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires to respondents. Then, linear regression was used to analyze the data.</p>

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>One of the findings of this study discusses the impact of sales promotions on impulsive buying. The relationship between sales promotions and impulsive buying is that the more attractive the sales promotions carried out by the company, the higher the chance of impulsive buying among consumers. Key elements constituting effective sales promotions include the frequency, quality, quantity, time, and target suitability of the promotions. These elements collectively enhance the efficacy of promotional strategies. Companies should strengthen their products to gain a position in the minds of consumers compared to similar competing products, thereby increasing impulsive buying. The discussion related to sales promotions is also supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kotler &amp;amp; Keller (2007)</xref>, which indicate that sales promotions are short-term and are used by companies to influence consumers to test or even make purchases of products or services. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Tjiptono (2008)</xref> revealed that companies often use sales promotions to attract new customers and encourage customers to buy more products, thereby increasing unplanned or impulsive buying. The results of this study are in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Badgaiyan &amp;amp; Verma (2015)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Tirtaning &amp;amp; Setiaji (2021)</xref>, which indicate that sales promotion has a significant positive impact on impulsive buying. Therefore, it can be concluded from this study that sales promotions influence impulsive buying.</p><p>The results of these two studies discuss the impact of product variants on impulsive buying. The relationship between product variants and impulsive buying is that the more complex the variants of a product, the greater the chance of impulsive buying behavior in consumers. Product variants can be based on the availability of goods, appearance, and product variations. The more diverse the products that can be provided by a company, the better the consumers' view of a brand will be. When the company continues to innovate to meet the needs or desires of consumers, this triggers their sense of comfort when shopping, which enables them to make spontaneous impulse purchases. This also aligns with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Utami (2010)</xref>, which indicates that product variants are groupings of different products in shopping centers and can create consumer flexibility to choose a product, thereby influencing their considerations when shopping. Consumers prefer products that are more innovative and varied because those products can impress them admirably, enabling those consumers to appreciate them more and purchase them. This finding is also supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Anggraeni et al. (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Vishella &amp;amp; Megawati (2022)</xref>, which indicate that product variants have a significant and positive impact on impulsive buying. It can be concluded from this study that product variants also influence impulsive buying.</p><p>The last finding of this study explains the simultaneous impact of sales promotions and product variants on impulsive buying. As for unplanned purchases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Utami (2010)</xref> defined impulsive buying as a form of purchase that occurred due to a sudden desire in consumers to own a product quickly, which must be fulfilled at that time. Impulsive buying is based on spontaneity when shopping, stimulus, and indifference to the consequences after making a purchase. Before finally making an unplanned purchase, the irrational behavior patterns of consumers are motivated by various reasons when they go shopping. Impulsive buying is caused by the influence of sales promotions and product variants. This is also supported by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Rasuli et al. (2022)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Safitri &amp;amp; Nurdin (2021)</xref>, which indicate that sales promotion and product variants jointly have an influence on impulsive buying.</p><p>The results of this study provide robust support for the theoretical constructs employed as the foundational premise, confirming their alignment with prior theoretical research. It has been demonstrated that the results corroborate previous empirical studies, particularly with respect to the sales promotion variable. Moreover, the findings are poised to serve as valuable inputs for corporate strategy formulation. Specifically, they offer actionable insights for companies, particularly in crafting policies aimed at increasing sales of Pixy Lipcream products.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Based on the research conducted on 100 respondents regarding the impact of sales promotions and product variants on impulsive buying of Pixy Lipcream in Semarang City, the following conclusions have been obtained:</p><p>The sales promotion variable has a positive and significant impact on impulsive buying;The t-test results in this study indicate that the product variant variable has a positive and significant impact on impulsive buying; The results of the F-test in this study show that the sales promotions and product variants jointly have a significant impact on impulsive buying. </p><p>The conclusions of this study provide additional empirical evidence on the impact of sales promotions and product variants on impulsive buying, as shown in the Impulse Buying Theory of Hawkins Stern.</p><p>Based on the findings obtained from analyzing the respondents' answer data, the following suggestions have been provided in this study: </p><p>The company can enhance its competitiveness by offering discounts, particularly during specific events, which could potentially lead to significant sales growth. Several items can be added as free gifts or bonuses for consumers. In addition, attention can be paid to the duration or time period of sales promotions to create effective promotions; The company can conduct a survey of the needs of Indonesian women to adjust to the trends and use other products as a comparison, thereby creating more varied colors based on the needs and skin types of consumers or the target market.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that not all determinants of impulsive buying as proposed by Hawkins Stern’s Impulse Buying Theory were incorporated into the analytical model. Further research could add other variables to the theory to examine their roles in influencing impulsive buying behavior.</p>
