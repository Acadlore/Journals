      <abstract><p>Water plays an essential role in shaping the aesthetics and psychological impacts of urban waterfronts, thereby enhancing their popularity as centers for tourism, communal activities, and events. The universal appeal of water attracts a diverse audience, including both residents and visitors, leaving a lasting impression on all who experience its charm. Urban waterfronts, epitomized by the historical city of Alexandria, Egypt, are cultural and historical repositories, showcasing a rich tapestry of architectural styles and epochs. Alexandria's waterfront presents a scenic view of the Mediterranean Sea, enriched by its architectural diversity. However, waterfronts face numerous challenges that underscore the critical need for their preservation and development. The development of waterfront areas involves transforming these zones into vibrant, sustainable, and appealing spaces that encourage community interaction and enhance the quality of urban life. This encompasses a comprehensive approach to placemaking that integrates architectural design, urban planning, environmental responsibility, social equity, and economic viability to forge places of unique identity and aesthetic value. The research presented herein reviews existing literature on urban waterfront development strategies and processes, and examines successful international cases of waterfront revitalization. A focus is placed on the El-Anfoushy touristic promenade in Alexandria, employing the SWOT analysis to assess its current conditions and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize actionable outcomes. These methodologies facilitate the quantification and strategic prioritization necessary to address the challenges confronting this historical area. The ultimate objective of this study is to provide a sustainable smart development agenda that can be effectively implemented to rejuvenate and preserve waterfronts, offering a framework for city planners and policymakers to foster sustainable urban environments.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The waterfront is the intersection of water and land. Water surrounds a portion of the land at its edge. This waterfront land involves a lot of human activity, as well as the most varied aspects. The water view has a significant impact on human emotions and the environment. Often, planners organize the waterfront into a belt along the beach. As a result, planners look for ways to make these locations more appealing to the public so that people will use them. The key obstacles are connecting traffic, setting up distinct functions, and communicating with the inner city. In general, the shoreline serves as the city's activity center. This zone is home to new public parks, residential communities, recreational spaces, and mixed-use zones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Extended waterfronts that reach a short distance into the city center are beneficial for city-water links, although their shape and the location of the city are the most significant influences. The potential for public spaces to be created on the waterfront and connected to other nearby public spaces is increased by extended waterfronts. To improve cities sustainably, social life and the natural world must coexist. Urban natural water features play a major role in creating this balance. Water is regarded as a crucial component in the process of designing to satisfy the physical and psychological needs of humans. Additionally, it adds several utilitarian and aesthetically pleasing elements to the current environment. Aesthetic effects include tactual, psychological, auditory, and visual aspects. The visual includes a space that is livelier and more enjoyable because the soothing sound of flowing water and still water creates a mirror effect, and optical features act as reflective elements, elements of calm and movement, and a feeling of expansion. The audial effect includes a sense of life, vitality, and happiness; stalling water contributes to a tranquil atmosphere; and flowing water gives energy and produces a musical effect. The tactual effect is sensed while diving into the water, which serves as a sort of retreat from the outside world. The psychological effect includes people's emotional responses to water reflecting their spirits, the sensitive outcome that is visible to the brain, and the aquatic aspect as something that breaks the continuity of life. As a result of the great positive impact of the water bodies on the community, all trends and thoughts must be directed toward the development of urban waterfront zones. The urban development of the waterfront targets creating an interaction between the community and the urban context by creating sustainable, vibrant, comfortable, and attractive spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>This research deals with a case study of El-Anfoushy waterfront in Alexandria, Egypt, where the city's unique imprint is further enhanced by its waterfront location overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The location is also known by the Pharos Island of Alexandria as the lighthouse; one of the seven wonders of the world was built on it. However, the island had been destroyed and drawn by an earthquake. According to the archaeologist Jean-Yves Empereur, in 1994, he made an amazing discovery about the lost island, as he mentioned that there are a lot of monuments and statues dating back to the Greek era that are drawn under the water. The district is considered a historical area that was developed as a tourist promenade 15 years ago by the Egyptian government; however, nowadays the waterfront faces several problems. One of the biggest problems facing the waterfront space is the maintenance of the urban imageability elements due to the humidity and the preservation of cultural and social aspects in this area. The primary objective of the study is to restore the distinctive identity of this unique site while leveraging its waterfront location within the context of a development plan that prioritizes sustainability in the design process. This endeavor includes the incorporation of smart technology into the design framework to enhance the project's value and facilitate integration with novel technological advancements, along with the preservation of its remarkable historical features. Through the implementation of this developmental approach, users stand to benefit from heightened opportunities to engage with the natural waterfront environment, thereby enhancing their overall quality of life and fostering a deeper connection to the site's historical and cultural significance. Consequently, individuals are likely to perceive a sense of ownership over the locale, intertwining their newfound technological perspectives with the site's intrinsic attributes. Moreover, by stimulating tourism, this initiative is poised to stimulate economic growth and position Egypt as a forward-thinking nation committed to leveraging its unique assets through sustainable and technologically advanced design strategies that align with contemporary paradigms.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>The research methodology, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, comprises two primary sections. The first part is a literature review that presents understanding urban waterfront development and its processes, studying waterfront development strategies, and investigating two international examples of cities that succeed in developing their waterfronts, as the selection of Jeddah and Casablanca was based on their strategic blend of natural beauty, cultural significance, and economic potential. According to the previous theoretical part, the research proposed a sustainable smart agenda that is easily implementable and encompasses key strategies for effective waterfront development.</p>

        </fig>
      
      <p>The second part is an application of the proposed agenda to the selected case study of El-Anfoushy Waterfront in Alexandria. Firstly, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using the SWOT method, which serves as a tool to assess the current situation of the waterfront by identifying internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. Followed by the AHP method, which provides a systematic framework for decision-making that helps stakeholders prioritize criteria, evaluate alternatives, and make informed decisions based on both qualitative and quantitative data. Additionally, questionnaires and interviews were conducted with experts and city planners, including those involved in previous developments in the case study area. This approach aims to establish a systematic framework, garnering support for policy-making initiatives while also enhancing transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness in the decision-making process, ultimately leading to the creation of vibrant and resilient waterfront communities. Secondly, an urban waterfront development was suggested based on the proposed sustainable smart agenda to develop the El-Anfoushy waterfront touristic promenade. This design incorporates adaptable strategies to conserve historic waterfronts, meet functional tourism needs, ensure long-term profitability, and enhance aesthetic appeal while safeguarding water integrity and environmental health.</p>

      <title>3. Urban waterfront development</title>
      <p>The term "urban waterfront development" describes the design, planning, and remodeling of spaces beside bodies of water in metropolitan environments. Riverbanks, harbors, lakeshores, and coastal zones are a few examples of these places. Urban waterfront development aims to produce aesthetically pleasing, sustainable, and dynamic areas that enhance the general well-being of a city or community. A combination of commercial, recreational, residential, and cultural components is frequently included in such developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. However, it is difficult to find an excellent urban waterfront. Project for Public Spaces (PPS), a well-known non-profit organization, is committed to placemaking, which involves creating and sustaining public places that foster community development. Its staff has surveyed more than 200 urban waterfronts worldwide, encompassing robust lakefront burgs such as Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland, and Zurich, rivertowns like London, Paris, Buenos Aires, and Detroit, as well as seaside cities including Hong Kong, Vancouver, Miami, and Athens. While nearly every waterfront has some potential aspects, successful waterfronts are extremely uncommon. Here are some examples of the best waterfront city strategies in urban design: Stockholm, Sweden: The shoreline of Stockholm, a city of islands, has changed over time to accommodate a variety of uses. There aren't many busy roads, making biking and walking enjoyable. People are drawn to public places like City Hall and Kingstree Garden by Stockholm's promenades and esplanades, and pedestrian-only pathways connect to various parts of the city [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Porto, Portugal: The waterfront has human-scaled developments that connect two levels of a promenade along the slope and create active nodes with three entrances and broad plazas. Venice, Italy: Venice is special for one obvious reason: there are no cars there. It is all in the water. This implies that the only ways to move around are on foot, via water taxi, or by vaporetto. There are several examples of unique waterfronts; however, each one has its own unique features and design identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. To achieve a successful urban design development of a waterfront, there is a development process that includes several phases that must be followed, such as:</p><p>A. Preparatory / Exploration Phase</p><p>â¢Analyze every facet of the area while considering its development, beginning with collecting and evaluating data. Primary data can be received directly from city hall, or raw data can be obtained via the statistics office. It may be acquired by secondary data that earlier studies have mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>B. Feasibility Study Phase</p><p>â¢Determine whether the waterfront development project is viable from an economic, environmental, and social standpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>â¢As a strategy or indicator, project financing may involve arrangements with staggered payments disbursed over years following the project's finalization. Additionally, private developers often receive tax exemptions, which, while beneficial to their endeavors, have the potential to disrupt the equilibrium of public budgets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>C. Zoning Phase/Master Planning Phase</p><p>â¢Develop a thorough master plan that describes the objectives, vision, and design concepts for the waterfront.</p><p>â¢Conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to assess the development's possible environmental effects and determine how to reduce any negative effects.</p><p>â¢Involve the community in public consultations and involvement to make sure the project fits their requirements and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>D. Design and Implementation Phase</p><p>â¢Obtain the necessary permits and consents from environmental agencies, local government agencies, and other pertinent organizations.</p><p>â¢Verify all regulations and ordinances that apply to the project's location.</p><p>â¢Work together with urban planners and architects to develop a comprehensive plan that incorporates green spaces, recreational places, and sustainable elements.</p><p>â¢Focus on new trends in design and incorporate smart and sustainable systems into the design concept to address human needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>â¢Through the promotion of compact, mixed-use, and transit-oriented development, sustainable urban design aims to reduce reliance on private automobiles while encouraging pedestrianism, cycling, and the use of public transportation networks. Such initiatives have the potential to decrease energy consumption and emissions from transportation activities while also improving air quality and public health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>â¢Design unique, suitable elements and features as street furniture using sustainable materials and incorporating smart technology, while preserving the identity of the surroundings, meeting user needs, and considering the environmental aspects of waterfront sites.</p><p>â¢Respect the cultural heritage of the site's inhabitants; sustainable development initiatives should aim to curate activities that align with their cultural practices, fostering greater engagement between the community and the waterfront environment.</p><p>â¢Adopt adaptable and flexible design strategies to accommodate shifting climatic conditions. To address changing needs, utilize dynamic zoning restrictions and flexible infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>E. Operational Phase</p><p>â¢Establish the promenades, parks, roadways, and utilities that are required to support the development of the waterfront.</p><p>â¢Incorporate sustainable water management techniques such as flood mitigation, stormwater control, and water quality preservation into practice. This should involve the integration of natural drainage systems and green infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>â¢Introduce innovative systems to augment the drainage infrastructure and repurpose rainwater for irrigation through the utilization of appropriate materials and mechanisms, such as a porous paving tile system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>â¢Implement the project's infrastructure after a thorough examination of the surrounding environmental conditions. </p><p>â¢Design street furniture using sustainable materials capable of withstanding the climatic variability of the waterfront area. For example, consider utilizing limestone for its durability, integrating green concrete, and incorporating stone blocks as wave attenuators.</p><p>â¢Execute the building step in accordance with the authorized plans and designs.</p><p>F. Monitoring and Maintenance Phase</p><p>â¢Create a plan for the continuous maintenance and management of the waterfront region. For example, evaluate infrastructures such as walkways, bridges, street furniture, and recreational areas on a regular basis to look for symptoms of deterioration.</p><p>â¢Maintain the waterfront area's aesthetic appeal by doing routine landscaping and cleaning.</p><p>â¢Monitor soil conditions, water quality, and air quality; put pollution control measures into place; and handle any environmental issues to maintain the ecosystem's health and the safety of locals and tourists.</p><p>â¢Interact with the surrounding community to collect feedback on the waterfront development and resolve any issues.</p><p>â¢Create channels of communication to inform the community about planned upgrades and current maintenance and to raise awareness among the public about the need to preserve local neighborhoods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>â¢Stay updated on local, state, and federal regulations related to waterfront development and ensure compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>â¢Regularly review and update policies related to waterfront maintenance and development.</p><p>â¢Create and update emergency response plans on a regular basis to deal with anticipated hazards like storms, floods, and other natural catastrophes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>â¢Organize regular emergency response team training sessions and drills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>â¢Make use of data analytics, sensors, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to monitor environmental conditions and infrastructure in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>â¢Use smart city technology to improve maintenance activities' responsiveness and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>â¢Create long-term strategies for waterfront developments' sustainability and flexibility, considering population growth and climate change into account.</p>

      <title>4. Waterfront development strategy</title>
      <p>Waterfront development strategy refers to the planning and implementation of various approaches and initiatives to enhance and utilize the potential of waterfront areas. It involves creating a vibrant and attractive environment by incorporating mixed-use spaces, public access, connectivity, natural features, and cultural attractions. It also emphasizes sustainable design and practices to minimize environmental impact. The goal is to create a dynamic and inviting waterfront that serves the needs of the community, attracts visitors, and contributes to the overall development and revitalization of the area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Urban planning processes take social and environmental factors into account, and the living environment has an impact on the overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. A comprehensive plan for developing or renovating waterfront properties is crucial to balancing conflicting demands, a vibrant economy, and a healthy social environment. This approach promotes inclusive, environmentally friendly, and sustainable development that is culturally and historically relevant. Various strategies are needed to overcome current techniques, improve capacity to handle obstacles, and create a conceptual framework for future opportunities. A sustainable waterfront should provide improved living conditions for city residents, celebrating the city's beauty, diversity, economic vitality, creativity, heritage, and natural environment. Also, preserving the natural environment is a necessary precondition for the effective development of a city's shoreline. Waterside areas play an important role in the global environment. On the one hand, the natural ecology must be protected while also improving its current state. Especially locations that were utilized for industry could improve this position today. Environmental protection can also be helped by reducing future energy usage and recycling materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p>

            <title>4.1. Sustainability</title>
          
          <p>Sustainability is one of the most essential strategic objectives for urban development. It should be included in the city's overall development strategy. Sustainable development is the process of meeting current requirements without jeopardizing future generations' ability to fulfill their own needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. As a result, including sustainability as a strategic aim in waterfront development initiatives is critical for improving inhabitants' living circumstances, not just economically and environmentally but also in terms of preservation and social inclusion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. Furthermore, sustainable development techniques seek to enhance human wellbeing by creating better locations for people to live, work, and visit in the present and future. Furthermore, sustainable methods of waterfront development incorporate a complete framework that includes shoreline maintenance, available resources, and usage requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Sustainability goals involve integrating sustainable waterfront development standards into all stages of the development process, including architecture, city planning, and urban design, and managing decisions across disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p>

                <title>4.1.1 Social sustainability</title>
              
              <p>While the waterfront region is seen as an urban asset that draws significant investment, the social part of waterfront development or any project is the most overlooked and difficult to handle. When people see friends, get to know their neighbors, and feel comfortable talking with guests, they become more committed to the area that promotes these types of social interactions. While acquiring a location might be difficult, once achieved, it becomes an evident trait. The area has a selection of cultural, educational, and recreational programs for people of all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Social cohesion and harmony are concerned with the opportunity to have/build social networks, participation in community life, environments that promote social cohesion and community connections, inclusiveness versus alienation, the creation of exclusivity or inequality, and tolerance of diversity through various recreational and social activities. Health advantages contribute to public health improvement since it has been established that spending time in nature improves mental weariness and the associated sentiments of aggressiveness and hostility. Natural resources provide a variety of âactivitiesâ that take little to no work while still restoring a person's physical and emotional wellness. Open places like these may help youngsters rest and unwind while also promoting social development. Physical health and wellness can also be maintained by engaging in organized sports, exercising informally, connecting with nature, and spending time outside in the fresh air and sunlight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p>

              <p>The waterfront contributes significantly to human wellbeing and the overall economy. It is crucial for coastal policymakers and analysts to evaluate coastal management measures. A waterfront area is valued as a measure of willingness to pay for improved ecosystem services. It encourages investment in the surrounding region and city, transforming it into an urban structure with high land value. However, these expenditures must be consistent with urban functions such as cultural, tourist, and recreational facilities. The waterfront is regarded as a key reason to develop the city's economy, but it may be wasted if it exploits the best position poorly, resulting in "jump-start" waterfront revitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Its economic benefits include trees and water, which reduce pollution control expenses, promotion of the city as a tourist attraction and commercial event, and an increase in property prices and tax income. Furthermore, waterfront locations may play an important role in the establishment of new businesses and local economies by bringing tourists and investors to the area. As a result, people who create, administer, and maintain the sites may have more chances for work. If the waterfront looks like a complicated and troublesome reality, its abundance of resources and promise are as obvious. The urban waterfront has always been extremely desirable, not just from a real estate standpoint but also from a sociological, cultural, and landscape perspective. It is a location associated with the historic city center, a stenographic area with high visibility, and a space for interaction between two distinct systems: land and water. From a location of intense traffic and economic development to a previously blighted and inaccessible urban area that later became one of the most valuable in the city, often at the center of new urbanization projects, the urban-port context has gradually focused attention on its historic and cultural identity, natural environment, and landscape. This currently presents a great opportunity for many international-level cities to define, promote, and implement their growth at the local, regional, and national levels. In some cases, the waterfront has been identified as a key value in urban and regional development. Most recent regeneration attempts have primarily resulted in the collective being able to "reclaim" areas facing the sea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p>

              <p>People and investments are constantly drawn to attractive and unique areas, but attempting to maintain this image may reduce the production of a generic environment as a result of contemporary growth. So, the difficulty of a successful waterfront is to create a distinct place based on its personalities and activities while still providing modern services. As a result, waterfront properties present excellent potential for urban development and allow the city to compete with other cities on a global scale to attract riches in both physical and human terms. Competitive advantage is an important part of many countries and municipal urban initiatives. While the waterfronts are extremely visible in most cities, their development is critical to many environmental and urban regeneration initiatives. Additionally, successful waterfront development necessitates an understanding of the global process. As a result, distinct settings, sufficient infrastructure, and distinctive locations at waterfront sites give cities a considerable competitive edge in the global economy and attract tourists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, the concern for coast ecology was previously ignored, and all attention was directed to industry and technology; however, in recent decades, the interest in creating ecological protection areas has grown, as has the importance of protecting water quality and the environment as a fundamental issue for development. Waterfronts in cities confront several issues, including global climate change, rising sea levels, and trash from diverse usage. As a result, environmental protection may be achieved by selecting appropriate economic-social applications and using resources responsibly, using all decision-makers' assets. Some uses are critical to achieving this, including ensuring water quality and environmental protection of aquarium life, lowering energy and material consumption, and utilizing green infrastructure such as trees and vegetation along greenways. These applications should help reduce energy consumption, enhance air quality, eliminate heat islands, and lower sound transmission and local noise pollution levels. Use sustainable storm water management and provide pedestrian-friendly walkways and appealing open areas with shade spots. It may also do this by implementing a sustainable transportation system, building using renewable energy resources, and managing garbage in a sustainable manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p>

          <p>Identity is a concept that distinguishes individuals from similar ones and expresses their uniqueness. It is influenced by experiences and preferences, which shape a person's identity in relation to their environment, people, and the world. The identity of a place is determined by the needs, expectations, feelings, values, and beliefs of its inhabitants, as well as the tastes and preferences of the people. The purpose of a place and the preferences of its inhabitants play a significant role in shaping its identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Culture and history play a crucial role in urban renewal, driving change, and promoting sustainability in the cultural sector. Integration of locations, people, economies, and cultures results in employment as well as social and sustainable development. Creative cities aim to enhance the relationship between social renewal, economic development, and regeneration. Because of their distinct local characteristics, these cities focus on urban planning, marketing, and revitalization. They evolve into creative clusters due to structural and economic changes, implemented through innovative initiatives based on the economics of excellence, culture, and territorial quality. This article aims to demonstrate the primary elements influencing creativity in cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] and new policies such as participation, history, local identity, cultural resources, sustainability, and an iconic case study of creative regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p>

The loss of local tradition and culture due to urbanization and population expansion has negatively impacted identity. The development of the waterfront provides a chance to exhibit the city's distinctive character and encourages identity preservation. The key to the waterfront's design and planning success is preserving the city's richness and feel as it evolves over time.

          <p>Imageability is the quality of a place that makes it recognizable and memorable. A place has high imageability when specific physical elements and their arrangement evoke distinct images or positive feelings. These physical elements, such as street furniture, street signs, landscape features, and building facade features, all together create a strong image for urban design. In addition, the waterfront cities have a great opportunity to have a stronger imageability of urban design as the waterscape evokes a distinct, strong image for the users and even the visitors. Moreover, the legibility of a city, according to the pioneer Kevin Lynch, has a great role in creating strong urban imageability, as it also combines both the ability of the physical object to project a strong, distinctive image as well as the ability of the observer to mentally select, process, store, organize, and endow the image with meaning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p>

              <p>Public space refers to meeting areas outside of buildings that promote community engagement and closeness. It prioritizes public engagement over ownership or stewardship. A good public area is both pleasant and appealing, with a sense of security, cleanliness, and sitting options. People prefer sites that provide a range of seating alternatives, allowing them to be in or out of the sun at different times of the day or year. A diversity of activities is required for a wonderful site to attract a diverse group of individuals at different times of day. Activities like playgrounds, basketball courts, and concerts may appeal to a wide range of ages and demographics. This is the most significant trait a location can have, since it becomes a preferred destination for people to meet friends, greet neighbors, and feel at ease talking with strangers. When a location becomes a preferred venue for people to meet friends, greet neighbors, and feel comfortable engaging with strangers, it is well on its way to being a fantastic destination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>To improve the waterfront experience, a waterfront design should incorporate many elements, such as a promenade or boardwalk, observation decks, docks, and art installations. These features can link services and activities, give panoramic vistas, and function as focal points for water-related events. Public art installations, sculptures, and murals may have cultural significance as well as aesthetic appeal. Playgrounds, sports courts, and exercise areas may encourage active engagement and increase the flexibility of the space. Environmental factors should be considered, such as introducing native flora, wetlands, or bioswales to boost biodiversity and filter stormwater runoff. Tourists may travel to the waterfront area and find numerous amenities and activities with clear signage and navigation systems. As a whole, an attractive shoreline may improve the whole tourist experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>Open public space design is a comprehensive process that includes building places that are inviting, useful, and visually appealing to the public. These spaces serve as gathering places for a variety of activities, encouraging social contact, recreation, and community involvement. In urban situations, scale is critical for producing drama, visual closeness, and reflecting a place's practical or symbolic value. The pedestrian environment depends on creating a comfortable degree of spatial confinement, with the optimal width equal to or less than the height of adjacent buildings. Hardscape materials must be visually appealing, structurally sound, weather-resistant, and require little upkeep. They must be used creatively to create areas that are appealing and detailed enough not to be readily destroyed. The ground is one of the planes that surrounds any space and can be handled in ways that complement or contrast with the space's and surrounding planes' characteristics. Attention to detail is critical for the quality of the public realm since it influences aesthetic appearance and practical accessibility. In big projects or regeneration zones, street design and material selection must be uniform and reasonable throughout the territory. In these circumstances, consistency in design and material selection is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p>

              <p>Along the urban waterfront, vegetation provides a variety of functions, including aesthetic, ornamental, and ecological ones. Improving people's quality of life, the environment, and the way the city is perceived are all dependent on it. The planning and organization of waterfront park greenery can be guided by an understanding of the fundamental concepts and layout of waterfront urban landscaping. Given that people are naturally drawn to water and are concerned about urban ecology, waterfront gardening landscapes are highly valued for their distinctive aquatic environments. It is aesthetically pleasing, ecologically significant, and blends in nicely with the surroundings. To better fulfill the role of ecological aesthetics, the plant landscape of the waterfront park can be combined with topographic features, zone construction of the water environment, and the ecological habits of various plants. It can also be arranged in a way that is reasonable and scientific to improve the city's climate environment while also meeting the needs of both people and nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p>Urban waterfront landscape plants: Trees, herbs, shrubs, creepers, and flowers are the five primary categories of plants found in urban settings. Although they all seem different, with various kinds of roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, and so forth, they all contain the same parts and serve the same purposes. As a result, the basic criteria used to classify plants are several; in addition, the plants' height, life cycle, branches, and softness of stem are all taken into consideration. The most intricate and challenging landscape plans are those for urban waterfronts. Urban waterfront landscape design requires careful selection of plants that can thrive in specific conditions, such as salty soil, wind exposure, direct sunlight, and salt spray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p>

It includes practical elements like benches, lighting, barriers, waste bins, and decorative pieces like banners and public art. Street furniture also helps manage traffic by designating lanes and separating pedestrian zones from vehicular traffic. Decorative elements like fountains provide relief in hot climates, while bike racks offer secure parking for cyclists. Seasonal kiosks serve temporary business or informational purposes during peak travel seasons. Street furniture contributes to the overall livability and vibrancy of public environments, transforming them into thriving centers of activity and innovation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p><p>Street furniture design should consider weather conditions, especially in coastal regions with high humidity and salty air. Strong shapes, organic materials, and natural finishes are essential for durability and minimal maintenance. Materials like stainless steel, outdoor-prepared iron, and synthetic resin are recommended for their durability and corrosion resistance. Concrete furniture offers a long lifespan and aesthetic appeal, often requiring no installation unless vandalism is a concern. Stone is also robust and resistant to damage, making it a cost-effective choice for various design styles. These materials contribute to the durability of street furniture and their ability to withstand weather conditions, providing functional and aesthetically pleasing solutions for public spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p>

They are also desirable areas for residential and commercial purposes, such as restaurants and shopping. Waterfronts must also adapt to a variety of stresses and changes, including quickly changing economic conditions and rising flood danger. Waterfronts are very adaptable in nature, which means they may serve a variety of functions. Local governments may want to create it for a specific cause, or they may desire to use waterfronts for numerous purposes at the same time. The latter is where they must exercise extra caution since distinct elements may be too contrasting to operate correctly when placed close to one another. This issue is also a strategic topic.</p><p>(1) Commercial: The waterfront may be a desirable location for enterprises of all sizes. This is why commercial waterfront developments are common.</p><p>(2) Residential: People construct waterfronts for residential purposes as well.

      <title>5. Analysis of international waterfront development examples</title>
      <p>To better understand how sustainable waterfront development initiatives can influence waterfront cities, this section will examine two international examples of prosperous sustainable waterfront development. The selection of Jeddah Corniche as the location for waterfront development stems from a strategic blend of natural beauty, cultural significance, and economic potential. Situated along the Red Sea, the Jeddah Corniche boasts breathtaking views of the water, creating an aesthetically pleasing backdrop for a waterfront development project. The city's rich historical and cultural heritage further enhances its appeal, offering a unique blend of tradition and modernity. Additionally, the Jeddah Corniche is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, providing a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere for leisure and recreation. The selection of Casablanca as the location for the Marina Project Development is a deliberate choice driven by a combination of strategic, economic, and geographical factors. Casablanca, Morocco's economic and business hub, is a vibrant metropolis with a rapidly growing urban landscape. The city's coastal location along the Atlantic Ocean not only provides a picturesque setting but also offers significant potential for maritime and leisure activities. The Casablanca Marina Project is designed to capitalize on these attributes, transforming the waterfront into a modern, sophisticated destination that integrates luxury living, commercial spaces, and recreational facilities. Moreover, the strategic positioning aligns with the city's aspirations for urban development and economic growth, making it an ideal location for attracting investment, tourism, and fostering a dynamic waterfront community.</p>

              <p>With the help of four large initiatives, this massive project, which was started in 2011 to enhance and extend Jeddah's waterfront, seeks to accomplish a number of objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p><p>1st stage: Development of Northern Corniche: The Northern Corniche is composed of three pathways that run parallel to one another and produce man-made lakes alongside the highways as they approach the sea, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>. The two components of the project's development plans will be created over the course of five stages: The first part has an amusement park, sand coastline, marina, outdoor dining options, attractions for families, kids' play areas, open green spaces, and outdoor festival centers. May 2011 was the beginning, and August 2012 marked the end. In the second part, 350 mÂ² of waterfront will be developed, along with 500 mÂ² of vegetated space, 4634 m promenades, 200 mÂ² of bathing beaches, 10 public restrooms, 25 Gothic-style buildings, 5 viewing towers, a marine transportation system, ornamental artworks, and 75 marine ports, and parking areas covering 1600 square meters, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>2nd stage: Development of Middle corniche: This section of the Jeddah seafront extends approximately 3.6 kilometers. The construction of the work, which cost around \$36.135 million, began in 2011 and was completed in 2013. Situated next to Palestine Road alongside the Central Corniche is the well-known Hassan Enany Mosque. It was constructed in 1984 by designer Raouf Helmi on Hassan Enany's contract, a Makkan businessperson. It is a unique prayer hall with space for 1200 worshipers, capped with an octagonal gold dome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>. This section included the development of 800 parking spaces, infrastructural rainfall drainage, floral cases, asphalt, lights, signage, advertisements, irrigation systems, and benches, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p>

              <p>3rd stage: Development of Southern Corniche (Al-Saif Beach): This corniche is situated on Jeddah's southern shore and is parallel to the Jeddah South Highway, which connects the city's center to the south. The distance between this area of the shoreline and Jeddah's city is around twenty minutes. Additionally, compared to other coastal areas in Jeddah, this area features naturally occurring sand beaches. This construction project's initial stage contains a 230 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif">mÂ² landscape located 3 kilometers along the coast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>.

This free exhibition features a large collection of 26 bronze statues created by well-known artists, including Mostafa Sonbol, Jean Arp, Victor Vasarely, Hennery Moore, and CÃ©sar Baldaccini. By putting paintings and other sculptures at intersections and on sidewalks that run beside the Corniche, the Corniche's accepted form gives a sense of art throughout. Most of the statues and paintings are in the northern and central sections of the corniche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. The biggest collection of statues and paintings by well-known international artists is said to be housed in the Jeddah, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>.</p>

              <p>The adoption of laws and policies that support sustainable development is a crucial part of Jeddah City's efforts to enhance its waterfronts in a sustainable manner. This section will look at Jeddah City's current laws and rules on sustainable waterfront development and how they affect projects involving waterfront development. The region's distinctive ecosystem, biodiversity, and natural resources are all to be preserved while promoting sustainable development through these initiatives. When conducting development operations alongside the waterfront, contractors must abide by these regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. Additionally, there are several opportunities to support Jeddah City's sustainable waterfront development and bolster current laws and policies. One chance is to employ technology, like drones and satellite imaging, for tracking compliance with regulations, which can help enforce current regulations more effectively. Enhancing cooperation and coordination presents another chance. Additionally, there are chances to support Jeddah City's sustainable waterfront development and bolster current laws and policies.

          <p>Morocco's economic hub is Casablanca. The city has a deep, personal, and intricate relationship with the Atlantic Ocean since it represents the city's urban development, its entryway to the outside world, and the source of previous colonizing dangers. For ages, the city has been giving in to the water due to the latter, with the coastline region being used for harbor operations, large-scale manufacturing, or just general degradation.

It became the melting pot of a modern civilization due to the mingling of inhabitants and the productive collaboration of businesspeople, speculators, professionals, and wise officials. It has, nevertheless, continued to be a battleground for conflicts between political parties, socioeconomic classes, and national groupings. Casablanca demonstrates the paradoxes of its status as the principal port of contemporary Morocco, with the affluence and sophistication of its bourgeois population coexisting with the destituteness of those who have been uprooted from the countryside, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. 26 hectares in all were created for the project, including 10 hectares that were retrieved from the sea. Its principal components are a central business district, neighborhoods, establishments, and open places. The building's program has 476,600 mÂ² of floor space overall, not including parking lots, and is divided into several uses: workplaces (33%), commerce (15%), lodging (12%), recreation, amenities, and amusement (10%), and housing (30%). In addition to becoming a commercial center, the project linked two of the city's most notable buildings, the Hassan II Mosque, and the Casablanca Port, and restored the city's connection to the ocean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>].</p>

              <p>3rd stage: Components during the final phase: The project's objectives are to build hotel rooms, residential towers, and business, office, and recreational facilities in the center, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>. Given the project's location, the harbor will have a significant tourism hub that provides a range of facilities to improve the surrounding area, which includes the historic Medina and the port of Casablanca in addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Marjane Shopping Center connects the new residential and business district of âCasablanca Marinaâ into which it is harmonious, with the other parts of the city and the old medina. It is situated between Boulevard des Almohades to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the north. Additionally, it perfectly blends in with the vibe and atmosphere of the Kingdom's new Corniche, which is not exclusively just a strolling and holiday spot but rather a venue for gatherings and diversity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>].</p><p>4th stage: Components under construction: The centerpiece of Casablanca, Morocco's plans to entice visitors and residents with an exciting new attraction, is a huge aquarium. A 15,000 mÂ² aquarium with a variety of marine creatures, including sharks, sea lions, dolphins, and penguins, would be constructed at the Casablanca Marina, show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>. The Oceanographic Park of the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, Spain, which is collaborating with the new aquarium following the signature of a memorandum of understanding in April 2013, served as the model for the plans, which are the brainchild of the Casablanca-based Al Manar Development Company (AMDC). It is a Dolphinarium, a shark tank, and habitats for a variety of marine life will also be part of the development. The lead developer for the project is Groupe Coutant, a specialist in aquarium design. With this aquarium installed in Casablanca Marina, the city hopes to become more appealing and competitive both regionally and globally as a travel and business attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. The structural behavior of the Marriott hotel is determined by its twisting shape, which includes a crooked triangular floor that rotates at each subsequent floor, totaling a 135Âº twist.

              <p>A significant shift in Morocco's tourist strategy has been the country's intention to support yachting tourism through the establishment of marinas. In an effort to transform the kingdom's maritime infrastructure, a number of initiatives have been developed. First-class lighting and hardwood candelabras were chosen by the government due to the excessive humidity in the area. With the help of the Downtown Waterfront Landscaping &amp;amp;amp; Maintenance contract, Casablanca was able to increase the number of employees, including a number of women, who are not often seen in this industry. They have made investments in snow removal services, IOT cleaning systems for landscapes, and new equipment that will enable them to concentrate on landscaping prospects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>].</p>

            <title>7.1. Historic background</title>
          
          <p>Alexandria became Egypt's capital after Alexander the Great conquered the kingdom in the fourth century BC. During Ptolemy II's reign, the city served as Egypt's principal gateway to the outside world, known for its ports, harbors, lighthouse (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World), and trade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. The air of the ancient Mediterranean city is still best inhaled in the Bahary area, located at the western end of the corniche, a 17-kilometer-long coastal promenade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The site of Baá¸¥ary was formerly the Heptastadium, the bridge that connected the mainland to the island of Pharos, connecting the Eastern and Western Harbors, when Alexandria was the hub of the Hellenistic world, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>. The neighborhood is likely named after Augusto Anfossi, an artillery instructor under Mohamad Ali. There are many historic buildings, like the citadel of Qaitbay and the El Morsy Abou-El Abbas Mosque. This 13th-century mosque was dedicated to Andalusian Sufi Sheikh El Morsy Abou-El Abbas and housed his grave. The Citadel of Qaitbay, a defensive castle, was erected by Mamluk Sultan Al-Ashraf Qaitbay, Egypt's ruler, from 1468 to 1496 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. El-Anfoushy is positioned along the Mediterranean coastline, offering residents and visitors breathtaking views of the sea. Known for its charming streets, El-Anfoushy is a blend of traditional and modern elements, featuring a mix of historic architecture and contemporary amenities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. The Morsy Abou-El Abbas and Bahari neighborhoods of Alexandria were formerly a cemetery area named Bab Al-Bahr, which means "gateway of the sea" since it faces the sea. Although, cemeteries were traditionally built outside the city walls, as more foreigners arrived, the city expanded beyond its boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the city's walls had been mostly dismantled. Bahari and El-Anfoushy were the first regions to be developed since they were adjacent to the city's major port, and it made sense for them to become fishing hotspots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>].</p>

          <p>El-Anfoushy is a neighborhood in El-Gomrok district, the west of Alexandria, Egypt, and overlooks both the Eastern and Western harbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. El-Gomrok, covering an area of 4.7 k<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif">mÂ², is considered the oldest district in Alexandria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>]. Additionally, it is recognized as the smallest and most densely populated area in the city, accommodating 165,558 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>]. The Mediterranean Sea's geographic location appears to have a significant influence on this area's ability to enjoy its moderate climate, which is ideal for human life during the whole year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>]. El-Anfoushy is known for its historical significance and cultural vibrancy, and it blends traditional architecture with contemporary structures, offering a diverse urban experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. It is recognized as a neighborhood on the ancient Pharos Island and stands as one of the city's oldest suburbs. It is the starting point for exploring the hidden jewels of old Alexandria, away from the modern hotels, buildings, and restaurants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. El-Anfoushy is home to many old landmarks, including El Morsy Abou-El Abbas Mosque, El-Anfoushy Fish Market (Halaqat el-Samak), and Anfoushy Tombs. Its strategic location provides easy access to Alexandria's iconic landmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>].</p><p>The touristic promenade varies in width from 40 to 70 meters, extending 540 meters along the eastern harbor on the Mediterranean Sea, including many recreational buildings like clubs, restaurants, and aquarium museums, and ending by the citadel of Qaitbay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. This promenade has proven to be a valuable asset to the community, attracting people together for social gatherings and tourists to take in the breathtaking scenery and appreciate its monumentality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>As a first phase in the waterfront development process, the location of the touristic promenade has been identified using Google Earth map, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref>, to initiate the survey process and document the current conditions, considering all users and site needs for the design process. These current conditions have been presented by the following maps, Figure14, Figure15, Figure16, created through field surveys and multiple site visits to analyze various aspects of the site, encompassing solid and void areas, land use of surrounding buildings, building heights, building conditions determining facades in need of restoration, landmarks in context and their relation to it, and evaluating circulation and pathways around the site to study the promenade's permeability.</p>

            <title>7.3. Current situation</title>
          
          <p>The waterfront touristic promenade is regarded as one of Alexandria's primary urban potentials and is integrated into the urban fabric of the city. It has existed since antiquity and represents the various historical eras in the city's growth. The current location of the promenade is notable for its significant tourism appeal, drawing both local and international visitors and consequently resulting in a notably high visitor density. However, the existing standards fall short of meeting the diverse needs of guests in terms of services and the overall design of the place. In particular, public amenities, including furniture and lighting fixtures, exhibit several design flaws. Moreover, there is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm for programs aimed at educating people and improving the overall health and environment at these cultural centers. The situation is further compounded by environmental degradation, marked by the loss of trees and a variety of plants, as well as an alarming increase in litter. This not only detracts from the aesthetic appeal of the location but also poses potential environmental hazards. Regrettably, the specific details about the location, including its services and features, are not provided on the website, limiting the potential for informed decision-making and exploration by potential visitors. In essence, while the location holds great tourism potential, there is a pressing need to address deficiencies in service standards, place design, public amenities, and environmental conservation efforts. A comprehensive improvement strategy that encompasses these aspects could significantly enhance the overall appeal and sustainability of the site. The current situation, borders of the site, and its relation with the city as a whole have been identified, as well as some shots have been drawn, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_17">Figure 17</xref>, to determine all the development needs and begin the development design plan.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_18">Figure 18</xref> summarizes the SWOT analysis of the current situation, which is also presented by some recent photos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_19">Figure 19</xref>. This analysis determines the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats using the proposed waterfront strategies. These strengths and opportunities might help in achieving objectives; besides, weaknesses and threats might resist accomplishing targets. Then, apply the AHP method to prioritize these outcomes to make them measurable and to assign pairwise comparisons between these factors to determine their relative importance in achieving the overall goals of waterfront development and identifying the most effective approaches for revitalizing the waterfront area. The AHP method is utilized within the SWOT matrix by assessing SWOT groups through pairwise comparisons, utilizing a scale ranging from 1 to 9, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. This is followed by the comparison of SWOT factors within each group, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>. The collective priority of the SWOT factors is then determined, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>. The waterfront development process of El-Anfoushy can be improved by preserving strengths, providing different solutions for weaknesses, seizing opportunities, and avoiding threats. These approaches also suggest a supportive strategy for the enhancement of tourism as a dynamic unit by incorporating strategies, tools, and protection and sustainability goals to establish a "Breathing Life into Waterfront," which can develop and progress smartly and sustainably throughout the years while considering its history.</p>

          <p>Following the surveying phase, a prominent issue identified in the locale pertains to street vendors. As a trial of a past development plan, the government introduced three kiosks on the pedestrian pathways as a prototype for vendors. Over time, this endeavor was abandoned, leading to vendors haphazardly placing their goods on the streets, obstructing pedestrian pathways. This development plan addresses this predicament by proposing a solution centered on the creation of sustainable and smart kiosks tailored to the vendors' requirements, strategically positioned for easy accessibility to visitors. The envisaged kiosk design is constructed from galvanized steel to withstand Alexandria's climatic conditions. The apex of the kiosk features a photovoltaic panel, ensuring the autonomy of the kiosk's electricity supply. Characterized by a lightweight structure, the kiosk is easily assembled. It offers vendors ample shelving and a spacious glass vitrine to effectively showcase their merchandise. The design incorporates a canopy to shield visitors from intense sunlight, fostering a pleasant and comfortable environment. Additionally, the development plan advocates for the integration of classic-designed street furniture to preserve the locality's identity while incorporating smart technologies, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_23">Figure 23</xref>.</p>

            <title>8.4. Accessibility</title>
          
          <p>The accessibility of the waterfront is regarded as one of the top tourist attractions. Creating an accessible design is crucial for both individuals and people with disabilities. There are three main paths in this area: one for pedestrians, one for bikes, and one for golf cars and emergency cars. Additionally, there are some plazas, several activities, and a tiered walkway along the promenade that stretches beside the Mediterranean Sea and leads to the Citadel of Qaitbay, the area's main tourist destination. Along with various pieces of street furniture and safety barriers along the sidewalk, the promenade promotes public access. Boats, automobiles, buses, and horse-drawn carriages are some of the modes of transportation that are utilized to reach the shoreline.</p><p>While the development plan incorporates pedestrian-oriented design principles, the pavement is constructed with permeable tiles designed to interact with precipitation during the winter. This thoroughfare is segmented into distinct lanes, accommodating cyclists, pedestrians, and golf carts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_28">Figure 28</xref>. To incentivize increased pedestrian activity, solar footpaths are strategically integrated into specific nodes and connected to sensors that harness kinetic energy from walking, generating electricity. Comprising solar tiles measuring 35 by 35 cm each, this sustainable pathway yields approximately 53,000 kWh of electricity annually, aligning with the objective of achieving carbon neutrality. This dual-purpose solar path not only powers a public edifice but also presents a versatile technology applicable to diverse settings, capable of supplying energy to buildings and various outdoor utilities. The golf cart lane employs basalt stone as its material, serving the dual purpose of reducing vehicular speed for enhanced safety and adhering to environmental friendliness. Vegetation is intentionally incorporated into the design, considering specific ratios and species for both environmental remediation and aesthetic considerations. Preserving existing palm trees in the district, additional shrubs contribute to visual continuity and are strategically planted for waterfront utilization. For swift errands, journeys to the Link light rail, ecologically conscious commutes, and numerous other reasons, the user can rent electric foot scooters and bicycles with batteries through scooter communicating and bike share programs. Simply put, the user can ride the nearest bike or scooter that is accessible to his location, then park it appropriately so that someone else can use it.</p>

It can involve landscaping, architectural design, public art installations, and the preservation of natural elements. These enhancements create a visually stunning environment that residents and visitors can enjoy. The idea of quality of life is multifaceted and sometimes impressionistic, with varying meanings for various individuals. Combining the psychological and physical inputs results in the best possible quality of life. Along with factual measurements of people's and communities' conditions, the idea of quality of life also encompasses subjective or qualitative occurrences at the individual and communal levels. City officials and other stakeholders, such as those concerned with social, sustainable, human, and healthful development, have a vested interest in quality of life. Thus, quality of life is important because a lot of people and organizations are paying attention to it.</p><p>Waterfront development provides various recreational opportunities. It can include the construction of marinas, boat docks, and fishing piers, allowing people to engage in water-based activities. Additionally, waterfront parks, walking paths, and cycling trails offer spaces for exercise, relaxation, and socializing. It improves quality of life by providing access to a vibrant waterfront, which enhances the overall quality of life for residents. It provides them with a unique and enjoyable environment to explore, relax, and connect with nature. Waterfront areas often become community gathering spaces for events, festivals, and cultural activities, fostering a sense of belonging and community pride. Waterfront development can incorporate sustainable design practices. This may include the use of green spaces, wetland restoration, storm water management systems, and energy-efficient infrastructure. These initiatives promote environmental conservation, enhance biodiversity, and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable ecosystem. Social Connectivity: The development of public spaces along the waterfront encourages social interaction and community engagement. Waterfront promenades, plazas, and seating areas provide opportunities for people to connect, socialize, and enjoy shared experiences. This fosters a sense of community and strengthens social bonds among residents.</p><p>Waterfront areas often become cultural and entertainment hubs within a city. They may host art installations, live performances, music festivals, and food markets. These events and attractions contribute to the cultural fabric of the community, attracting visitors and fostering a vibrant atmosphere. Properly designed waterfront development has the potential to raise nearby housing prices. The appeal of living near a waterfront, with its scenic views and access to recreational activities, can make properties more desirable and sought-after. This can benefit homeowners and contribute to the overall prosperity of the neighborhood. Diversity is important, but it's not a necessity for every endeavor. Every location has distinct social, political, resource, and environmental circumstances. The greatest choices for land use mixtures and their effects on the setting can be found by having years of experience along with an understanding of local and regional circumstances. Comprehending and strategizing for heterogeneous interests in waterfront development is important to ensure successful project execution. Therefore, the research proposed a waterfront development agenda that comprises seven strategies: sustainability, imageability, identity, diversity, accessibility, stakeholdersâ responsibility, and smartness. Then, the research applied this strategy to the El-Anfoushy waterfront to develop its touristic promenade.</p><p>El-Anfoushy has been selected as a waterfront development case study in Alexandria, Egypt, since it is distinct and has a lot of potential for future development. The selection of El-Anfoushy district for urban waterfront development reflects a combination of historical significance, strategic location, community engagement, and economic potential. By leveraging these factors, planners can create a vibrant, sustainable, and inclusive waterfront that improves the quality of life for residents and visitors while preserving the district's unique identity and heritage. El-Anfoushy district's location along the Mediterranean coast makes it strategically important for urban development. This district boasts a rich historical heritage, dating back centuries. Its proximity to iconic landmarks such as the Citadel of Qaitbay makes it a significant cultural hub in Alexandria. Leveraging this historical significance provides an opportunity to blend modern development with preservation efforts, creating a unique and authentic experience for residents and visitors. The selection of El-Anfoushy district may have been influenced by an assessment of community needs and aspirations. By engaging with residents and stakeholders, planners can ensure that the development aligns with the priorities of the community, addressing issues such as public space deficits, economic opportunities, and environmental concerns. By providing new commercial and recreational opportunities, the development can attract businesses, create jobs, and generate revenue for the local economy.</p><p>The Egyptian government developed the waterfront tourist promenade of El-Anfoushy fifteen years ago; nevertheless, this area faces a multitude of challenges that make it a prime candidate for urban waterfront development. Due to the many challenges, the waterfront promenade confronts problems in maintaining the urban imageability features and preserving the social and cultural characteristics, in addition to the area's neglected potential and urgent concerns, and this reflects broader issues of economic disparity, environmental degradation, and social inequality. The district has historically been abandoned and underutilized, leaving the waterfront areas mainly undeveloped. The community's social neglect, environmental deterioration, and economic inequality have all been made worse by this neglect. Planners want to handle these problems head-on by concentrating on El-Anfoushy for reconstruction, bringing neglected areas back to life, generating employment possibilities, and promoting social harmony. The district's rich historical and cultural legacy also offers a chance to include heritage preservation initiatives into the design process, making it an attractive background for development.</p><p>The proposed agenda for urban waterfront development in the historic El-Anfoushy touristic promenade marks a significant milestone in the city's urban revitalization efforts. The implementation of mixed-use developments, including commercial spaces, recreational facilities, and green spaces, has not only enhanced the district's aesthetic appeal but also improved the quality of life for residents and visitors. Sustainable design principles have been integrated to mitigate environmental impact and preserve the area's natural beauty. The successful execution of the proposed agenda for urban waterfront development in El-Anfoushy district has catalyzed economic growth and stimulated tourism in Alexandria. The revitalized waterfront has become a magnet for both locals and tourists, offering a diverse range of leisure activities, dining options, and cultural experiences. The transformation of the El-Anfoushy waterfront has not only enhanced its physical landscape but has also generated a positive effect of social and economic benefits throughout Alexandria. By creating a vibrant public space, the development has encouraged community engagement and social interaction, fostering a sense of belonging and cohesion among residents. El-Anfoushy waterfront development has become a lively and dynamic attraction that perfectly represents the city's past, present, and future. Alexandria's vibrant promenades, lively markets, and cultural events attract tourists from all over the world, supporting the local economy and solidifying Alexandria's position as a top travel destination. Apart from its financial importance, the waterfront represents community perseverance, cooperation, and ambition; it is an example of what can be accomplished when vision, ingenuity, and group effort come together to work toward a common objective. Overall, the success of the proposed agenda for urban waterfront development acts as a perfect illustration of the beneficial effects that careful planning and community involvement can have on a city's social, economic, and sustainability.</p><p>After development, the promenade is expected to attract a large number of visitors, leading to overcrowding and significant pressure on the place. This overcrowding on waterfront areas can have several potential negative impacts on the local ecosystem and community. One concern is the increased pressure on natural habitats and ecosystems due to excessive human activity. Furthermore, overcrowding can contribute to pollution through littering, improper waste disposal, and runoff from recreational activities, leading to water pollution and degradation of water quality. Socially, overcrowded waterfront areas can result in congestion, noise pollution, and conflicts among visitors, diminishing the quality of the recreational experience for residents and tourists alike. Additionally, overcrowding can strain local infrastructure and services, including parking, public restrooms, and emergency response systems, leading to increased maintenance costs and decreased satisfaction among residents. It's essential for policymakers and stakeholders to manage and regulate visitor numbers to prevent overcrowding and mitigate its negative impacts on both the environment and the local community. This may involve implementing capacity limits, improving infrastructure, promoting sustainable tourism practices, applying smart sensors, and raising awareness about the importance of responsible behavior on the waterfront.</p><p>The proposed waterfront development in Egypt is in line with the country's national policies on urban development and tourism. Firstly, it reflects the government's commitment to fostering sustainable urban growth by transforming waterfront areas into dynamic urban spaces. This supports Egypt's objectives of creating livable cities and enhancing the quality of life for residents. Additionally, the project aligns with Egypt's tourism strategy, which emphasizes diversification and the development of new tourism products and destinations. By creating attractive waterfront amenities and recreational facilities, the development aims to attract tourists and stimulate economic activity in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, the project may incorporate principles of heritage preservation and environmental sustainability, in accordance with Egypt's efforts to protect its cultural heritage and promote responsible development practices. Overall, the proposed waterfront development represents a strategic alignment with Egypt's national priorities, contributing to urban renewal, sustainability, technology, economic growth, and the enhancement of tourism offerings.</p><p>It's essential for developers, planners, and policymakers to carefully assess and mitigate these negative impacts through sustainable design, habitat restoration, community engagement, and equitable development strategies to ensure that waterfront development benefits both the environment and the local community in the long term.</p>
