      <p>One of the most recent and relentless technologies for healthcare increasingly prevalent for effectiveness and efficiency are AI and NLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The advantages of artificial intelligence and Natural language as sister systems in society are being using in the healthcare as the youngest technological developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Human communications with the help of ICT tools like mobile phones, and computers via digital systems interact with chatbots, audios, video conferences, emailing and related applications which has shape the health sector thanks to AI and NLP. Users of AI and NLP software systems and application are able to access the numerous healthcare facilities without living their comfort zones. Artificial intelligence help automate systems to understand human languages with the help of natural language processing applications. The AI and NLP, whom most of the Mobile applications are built upon, function as sister technological systems. AI and NLP have the necessary systems, application and services to transform many areas of the modern world. Modern service providers now use email, text, phone calls, smart records, and virtual assistants as first contact points for almost all of their dealings, customer inquiries, and most preferred trading channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. The art of digital communication is a combination of artificial intelligence and natural language processing which they act as sister technological applications and system software to provide services to its users. Due to the population growth rate and the need to secure faster clinical results many aspects of healthcare users beginning with the employees, and practitioners through administrative processes within healthcare. The modern tele-pharmacies have shown that the modern health sector will depend strongly on artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide care monitoring, ease payment and analyze and interpret pharmaceutical results.</p><p>Deep learning is helping system devices and software applications to computer what comes naturally from human thoughts. With the coming of modern machine learning algorithms, many proms have been developed to analyses situations, and train system with the help of AI to function side by sight humans. Person-to-machine relationship via cyber-physical Systems is really a living science via the Internet of Everything thanks to artificial intelligence, robots, and industry 4.0 rewriting the interaction miracles between humans and computer-based applications. Modern technologies built on frequent use interfaces like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Gestures Recognition Interfaces, voice analysis, and handwritten and Facial Expressions Recognition is being used in sophisticated automation systems like clinical trial centers, research centers and service robotic systems environments but with little attention.</p><p>There are millions of multidisciplinary approaches and research studies emphasizing that artificial intelligence and natural language be built as a performer to assist humans in handling healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Artificial intelligence in healthcare for clinical services requires natural language processing applications to understand and classify clinical documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Natural language processing are the modern systems using a variety of automated application systems that can analyze and interpret clinical comments about healthcare users by providing an in-depth insight and detailed oriented issues of customers with the main purpose of breaking down the identified issue into understandable approach with high quality either by advancing necessary means, strategic methods, and better outcomes for healthcare users or by replacing services and systematic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Expert systems for healthcare required human abilities to reinforce, strengthen and modify when necessary, the applicable system software, and smart engineers to construct a large and accommodating intensive and extensive number of rules, and regulations that contain a certain level of knowledge with specify focus area to analyze and interpret clinical outcomes. When a healthcare a system is built such as an expert system software, they function well with constant follow-up until the point when they become easy to follow and managed or automated all their processes. But as the volume of data increases, the rules grow too large exceeding several thousand of the rules it can handle. This usually begins to conflict with each other and fall apart. The excess data volume stresses system software. The knowledge area usually changes in a significant way due to increased capacity oriented in previous rule requirements. The process of updating to meet the standard by changing the rules can be burdensome and laborious. </p><p>Artificial intelligence and natural language processing are slowly replacing human resource-based-rules systems with new approaches based on system-defined software interpreting data using proprietary medical algorithms. A lot of findings have indicated that artificial intelligence and natural language processing are better than humans at key healthcare tasks, such as diagnosing disease, analyzing, interpreting, and performing tasks. Nowadays, modern algorithms have already outperformed researchers in analyzing and interpreting patterns and guiding researchers in how to build cost-efficient clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>However, several reasons make us believe and think that in many years to come artificial intelligence will replace humans in many vast areas in medical process domains. In this article, we present a prototype system process, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing cluster of the dataset on deep learning models, a flow chart for artificial intelligence and Natural language processing for E-health, provide types of artificial intelligence and describe the potential of artificial intelligence offers to automate aspects of care and some challenges of implementation of AI in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Few decades ago, almost everything was done manually especial communication between healthcare practitioners and patients. Today, almost everything is in the digital form with some countries already applying robot surgeries. Some countries like USA, UK, Germany, Japan and China already have e-healthcare services that are fully virtual that can be independently run by robots. These already made-available system has made us to understand that digital healthcare services with the help of AI and related system applications in the future will be more advance than human capacity. Besides, the skepticism amongst users in today’s world to fully accept robot surgeries already signal the advancement of AI to human imagination and engagement.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Artificial intelligence as a collection of systems and applicable techniques such as NLP, ML and DL which are the most of technologies that have immediate importance to healthcare sector. The various processes, rules and tasks deep learning, machine learning and natural language processing support via artificial intelligence are very large. The following paragraphs represent some particular artificial intelligence technologies highly significant to healthcare. </p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Natural Language Processing. Natural language processing is one of the widely use application that understand and makes meaningful sense of human language [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. Thousands of artificial intelligence researchers indicate that Natural language processing quickly finds relevant information within a document using various systems incorporated such as semantic, tokenization, text tagging and textual categorization. The discipline of NLP includes text translation, speech recognition, and text analysis. Statistical and semantics are the most widely used approaches in natural language processing. Semantics analysis contributes and increase the accuracy of recognition. </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> above represents semantic explanation of information on NLP. Because of the large quantity of generated data involved in healthcare, NLP is becoming the dominant application used. The process of applying natural language processing in healthcare involved the creation, understanding, storing and classification of clinical documents and results. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> represent a systems semantics analysis of natural language processing step by step clustering unstructured clinical data. </p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Expert system software based. Expert systems software based. This is a system software that collects and analyzes information based on ‘if-then’ rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. In healthcare, the expert system software base is used for ‘clinical decision support’ purposes. The modern applications using the programming language of python have employed this system into its algorithm. Modern programmers have applied expert systems with the help of expert human resource and knowledge engineers to construct a series of rules in a particular knowledge domain with python programming language. In the past, when the number of rules increase, it was difficult to make decisions as rules conflict with different datasets. Nowadays programming languages have handled the capacity of load and with the help of system update the evolution of that datasets balances with system updates.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Healthcare physical robots. Healthcare physical robots are well-known as healthcare oriented industrial robots. Healthcare physical robots perform predefined tasks like scanning for X-rays, measuring weight, alarming for emergencies, and automatic bed adjustable in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. However, healthcare physical robots have become more collaborative with humans as seen through training enabling humans to go through desired tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. In 2002 healthcare physical robots surgeons were approved and they have improved to be able to see, create precise and minimally invasive incisions, and stitch wounds. However, even though healthcare physical robots perform this functions, important decisions within healthcare are still made by human surgeons.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Healthcare diagnosis and treatment application. In recent years, companies like IBM's Watson have become very popular because of the rules and focus on precision medicine such as cancer diagnosis and treatment. Watson applied machine learning and NLP applications to train datasets and understand human psychology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. IBM Watson is a set of ‘cognitive services’ providers using machine learning and natural language processing application programming interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. IBM Watson application is made up of speech and language, vision, and machine learning-based data-analysis programs. IBM Watson applications interfaces are technically capable of taking treatment programs provided by some vendors of open source, such as Google's TensorFlow.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Machine learning and deep learning models of neural networks. In healthcare, the most recent and still growing yet to be fully applied applications is machine learning. Machine learning precision help predefining what healing protocols are able to be successful on an individual basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. Majority of this application of machine learning and precision medicine applications require training of dataset for which are outcome variables known as supervised learning. Machine learning is a technological model of a neural network that has been existing since the 60s and has been highly and well established in healthcare trials. Deep learning is expanding with a wide variety of its used for speech recognition and it is seen as a form of NLP. Deep learning unlike other forms of statistical analysis, characteristics of deep learning typically has little meaning to a human. There are many hidden features in deep learning models, which are being revealed by processing graphics and cloud architectures. </p>

          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">The following paragraphs explain how importance is the application of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to the healthcare and how they are applied and in which level.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">AI-assistive mobile applications. The number growing technology that provides and enhances services like real-time patient data collection and monitoring for emergency care is artificial intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. Artificial intelligence applications offer preventive healthcare recommendations for healthcare providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. Better still, mobile applications is one of system used in monitoring movements and activities of patients especially in psychiatric hospital and elderly persons suffering from memory lost. Artificial intelligence applications are enabling the efficient implementation of in-home health monitoring, health information access, personalized health management, and the use of treatment devices such as visual assistive devices.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">NLP-assistive communication aids. Advances in supercomputing and natural language processing have enabled the delivery of more precise and personalized healthcare services to patients thanks to faster digital communications devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Natural language processing is an example of evidence base application supporting the adoption of virtual healthcare there by reducing healthcare costs while maintaining and improving the quality of care. Therefore, the use of NLP-based tools of electronic devices can result in potential savings for several end users in the healthcare industry. Examples include remote consultations, billing for healthcare payers and claims verifications. </p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Diagnosis. Diagnostic procedures and treatment process of disease have been the heart of healthcare for using artificial intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. Previous expert system software in the past has demonstrated some potential to accurately enable human diagnose and treat disease. These expert systems were based on laydown rules on procedure and process for humans but were not totally accepted for clinical practice. As improvement has been broadly involved, artificial intelligence and natural language processing integrated remote control system software are able to outperform humans. The integration of artificial intelligence and natural language processing has shown expert system software capacity to handle both based-rule procedure and process at the same time.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Healthcare administrative applications. The application of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings is somewhat less game changing as built self-drive human control software compared to self-drive system control patient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. Natural language processing and artificial intelligence for healthcare administrative assistants has substantially let efficiency and effectiveness. System embedded alerts, regulatory mechanisms, self-adjusted procedures have changed the power of doing something and waiting for something to be done.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Healthcare data verification. Natural language processing and artificial intelligence in healthcare has helped tremendously in verifying appropriate and justified claims and payment using administrative machine learning expert systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. A well-structured expert system built on proper algorithms can be used for pairing data across different databases. Insurers and providers now can rely on verified data from expert systems. It is easier now to determine whether the trillions of claims submitted daily are accurate or not. Identifying and correcting coding issues and incorrect claims has saved millions of dollars for healthcare providers.</p>

The system expert software required specifications in terms of population cultural heritage, behavior, history and global educational background. The system artificial intelligence and natural language processing guard data for a particular set of people and will require new datasets to apply to another group.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">⁕ The uniqueness and unavailable standardization of artificial intelligence and natural language processing across different systems which would have been easy to share data acquisition regarding human cultural heritage, education, health issues and eating habits across the globe. The unavailable standardized rules make it difficult to compare and combine data from multiple sources and make conclusions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">⁕ Ethical implications of AI is one of the challenges face by healthcare providers and practitioners. Health decisions such as clinical results within healthcare are exclusively by humans in previous years. There are many rules and regulations to issue clinical results for certain diseases but artificial intelligence doesn't qualify yet for such [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify;">⁕ The use of smart system machines to provide and assist with raises problem of accountability, transparency, permission and privacy has reduced but increase a lot of questions within healthcare sectors<span style="font-family: 宋体;">.</span></p>

The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> show how information moves from data source to natural language application. System software sends the information into classification section. Once information reaches the classification service center, it subs classified into two sub sections following predefine needs. At this stage two section received the information which are metric range and metric range substitute. From this stage information is send to the healthcare base on the need. If the information is urgently needed, prompt option is automatically activated.</p>

This proposed classification can enable health practitioners to predetermine the health condition of its patients based on text content as classified above. Deep learning model of recurrent neural networks and data classification can connect and allow digital automation of consultation of patients based pure understanding of language and its standard regulations and rules applicable. The input layer, hidden layers, and output layer skeleton of a deep learning model can classify information in any language based on 10 parts of speech as defined by this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> indicates that the transactions recorded on the DLM layer are stored in to different hidden layers. The information contained in each hidden layer represent parts of speech. Unlike spoken words, they depend on various parts of speech. There's no way a text can be out of the scope of language structure. If such a situation occurred then a new dictionary of the English language is required. Base on the above classification, it is pretty easier for healthcare practitioners to extract meaningful information. This can therefore help in decision making.</p>
