      <abstract><p>The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in healthcare has been increasingly recognized, particularly in medical image analysis and predictive modeling of patient outcomes. In this study, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture incorporating customized skip connections was introduced to enhance feature extraction and accelerate convergence during medical image classification. This model demonstrated superior performance compared with conventional architectures such as Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) and Visual Geometry Group with 16 layers (VGG16), achieving an accuracy of 96.5% along with improved precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). In parallel, patient readmission risks were predicted using an optimized random forest algorithm, which, after hyperparameter tuning, attained a robust AUC-ROC value of 0.91, thereby underscoring its stability and predictive reliability. The integration of these approaches highlights the ability of AI and ML systems to deliver more accurate diagnoses, anticipate potential health risks, and recommend personalized treatment strategies, ultimately enabling faster and more precise clinical decision-making. Despite these advancements, challenges persist regarding data privacy, interpretability of AI-driven decisions, and the ethical use of patient information. Addressing these limitations will be critical for the broader adoption of AI-enabled healthcare systems. The findings of this study reinforce the role of advanced AI and ML frameworks in improving healthcare delivery, optimizing the use of limited resources, and reducing operational costs, thereby supporting more effective patient care.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Healthcare systems are being greatly influenced by the development of AI and ML. Such systems have prompted medical teams to modify their approach to handling and caring for patients. AI and ML help medical teams enhance the delivery of healthcare services, guarantee the provision of high-quality patient care, and inform clinical decisions. At the same time, several obstacles exist to incorporating these technologies into healthcare, including privacy concerns, complex regulations, and trust-related issues. This study investigates the roles of AI and ML in healthcare, including their contributions to patient care, clinical decision-making, and healthcare system improvement.</p><p>In addition, patients often require more care, encounter new issues, and face regulatory and financial constraints that necessitate treatment tailored to their personal needs. Established medical practices rely on the trained instincts and prior experience of healthcare staff. Due to these challenges, increasing efforts have been made to integrate AI and ML into clinical practice, enabling doctors to achieve better outcomes. Thanks to AI, deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), and ML, doctors can now review multiple sets of information and recommend treatments for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Sen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Shashanka &amp;amp; Reddy, 2023</xref>). These systems are now used in different medical fields, including imaging, drug development, patient monitoring, and disease prognosis. Regulatory frameworks significantly affect AI/ML integration. For instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts the sharing of identifiable data across institutions, reducing the size of multicenter datasets and hindering model generalization. Similarly, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict compliance requirements that complicate model training and deployment pipelines in the European healthcare ecosystem.</p><p>Doctors rely on the combined technologies of AI and ML to aid in analyzing medical images. DL models can detect diseases, such as cancer, with great accuracy, often surpassing the performance of medical specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Balasamy et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Rana &amp;amp; Bhushan, 2023</xref>). ML also enables the forecasting of patient outcomes and personalization of their care, resulting in better ratings of care and a high-quality treatment experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ashreetha et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Rahman &amp;amp; Dua, 2025</xref>). A combination of AI and healthcare information has made it easier to manage long-term conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension because ongoing follow-up is necessary for these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Martinez-Ríos et al., 2021</xref>). Healthcare has benefited from the improvements of AI and ML, despite the challenges that remain. Protecting data privacy and security remains a significant challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Gulkesen &amp;amp; Sonuvar, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Massella et al., 2022</xref>). Privacy laws such as HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in the European Union, along with international privacy rules, are essential for handling sensitive healthcare data. Incorporating AI and ML into current healthcare systems is still a complicated and expensive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alanazi, 2022</xref>). It is also difficult to explain how AI models generate their outputs. Healthcare professionals and patients may lose confidence in these models because they are often referred to as "black boxes" and it is difficult to interpret the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Liu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>This study aims to explore in detail how AI and ML are transforming the delivery of medical care and the decision-making process for patients in innovative healthcare. This study highlights current practices and future expectations by describing various aspects of healthcare, including diagnostic imaging, treatment planning, predictive analytics, and patient monitoring. In addition, this study aims to identify the primary challenges associated with integrating AI and ML into healthcare and propose corresponding solutions. Real-world case studies enable the comparison of the positive and negative aspects of AI and ML in medical applications, as well as their impact on health outcomes. It adds value by helping to understand how AI and ML are being used in the healthcare sector. The findings of this study are anticipated to assist healthcare providers, policymakers, and technology developers in determining the most effective way to integrate AI into healthcare. In addition, the research points to future improvements in AI and ML that can better support patient care and cope with essential hurdles such as data confidentiality, ethical matters, and the integration of these technologies with other systems.</p><p>Different sections are included to provide a detailed explanation of the study. Section 2 examines current efforts in AI and ML within healthcare, highlighting major successes and challenges. Section 3 outlines the approach used in the study, including the data, algorithm models, program code, and the methods used to verify the outcomes, thereby enabling replication of the research. Section 4 discusses the outcomes of the experiments, overviews their performance, and highlights the graphic representations, discussing what they mean for doctors and patients. Ultimately, Section 5 summarizes the key findings, highlights the study's limitations, and suggests avenues for future research to enhance the effectiveness of AI in healthcare.</p>

      <title>2. Related work</title>
      <p>AI and ML have gained popularity in healthcare over the last few years, primarily because they can improve patient outcomes, enhance health management, and lower overall healthcare costs. Several studies now focus on the role of AI and ML in healthcare, which is applied in clinical diagnostics, patient care, treatment design, and the prediction of health outcomes. Focusing on clinical issues, most existing studies have assessed the effectiveness of ML models and examined how AI is being integrated into healthcare services. This study surveys the major research on autoimmune disorders, giving special priority to the most recent results and their applications. AI influences how images are reviewed in healthcare. Several studies have found that utilizing DL can aid radiologists in identifying diseases in various photos. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Shi et al. (2023)</xref> found that DL was as effective as, and in some cases even better than, several radiologists in diagnosing breast cancer. It was further noted that using AI frees healthcare providers from handling various routine tasks, as technology can provide fast and accurate result.</p><p>Efforts to predict outcomes are made easier with AI, which significantly improves the treatment of chronic diseases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Jeyalakshmi et al. (2024)</xref> explored the potential of using ML models to predict the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). By analyzing patient data, laboratory information, and medical history using ML models, it is possible to easily identify individuals who are likely to develop kidney disease. If many people adopt this approach, healthcare providers could identify and treat serious health issues earlier. ML can also identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes or hospital readmission, underscoring its benefits for patient care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Aljebreen et al. (2025)</xref> employed ML to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of patient readmission after surgery. Demographic, medical, and surgical details from the electronic health records (EHRs) were used to find individuals at greater risk of readmission. With high-risk patients identified, healthcare workers can ensure that resources are used wisely and provide the best after-hospital care to improve patient outcomes while reducing unnecessary healthcare costs.</p><p>AI is aiding in the design and personalization of treatment plans for patients. An interesting example from oncology, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Yaqoob et al. (2023)</xref>, involves the use of ML methods to determine chemotherapy tailored to individual patients. A method was developed to assess each individual's genetics and tumor information, suggesting the most suitable chemotherapy drugs for treatment. Therefore, it is simpler for doctors to determine the optimal treatment, indicating the possibility of saving lives and reducing complications for patients. In a study on diabetes management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Zale &amp;amp; Mathioudakis (2022)</xref> employed a similar approach. It was discovered that genetics, medical records, and lifestyle information could be utilized by software to determine the optimal treatment plan for diabetes as well as to manage blood sugar levels.</p><p>Although AI and ML offer many benefits, several studies have highlighted the challenges in integrating them into healthcare. Managing data is often challenging due to issues of quality and accessibility. Models powered by AI and ML require a substantial amount of high-quality data to function effectively. Nonetheless, some healthcare systems encounter issues, such as lack of interoperability among healthcare records, varying data collection methods, and privacy concerns, which hinder the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Mollerus et al. (2025)</xref> emphasized that data interoperability facilitates the integration of AI systems into healthcare. It was pointed out that the key to successful AI-driven technologies is the establishment of industry-wide data standards, the maintenance of data confidentiality, and cooperation among healthcare providers. In the current study, both the Chest X-ray (CXR) and EHR datasets adhered to publicly available data standards. Preprocessing pipelines addressed inconsistencies by normalizing formats, applying uniform coding systems, and harmonizing metadata fields to ensure compatibility across all data sources.</p><p>The interpretation of AI models, mostly DL algorithms, is also a challenge. Although these models excel in certain situations, their decision-making processes are often difficult to interpret due to the opacity of their internal mechanisms. Such a lack of disclosure might lessen the trust that medical professionals have in AI-based recommendations. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Sadeghi et al. (2024)</xref> wrote about the growing concern regarding the understanding of AI results by doctors and patients in healthcare. Methods were developed to improve model interpretability, including attention mechanisms and saliency maps, which highlight the data elements most influential in the model’s decision-making. Such approaches increase clinicians' confidence in relying on AI for decision-making. In healthcare AI, ethics is now a central point of importance. If AI is not programmed correctly, it may simply repeat the discrimination seen in healthcare data. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Gunawan &amp;amp; Wiputra (2024)</xref> investigated if biased AI in healthcare poses ethical problems. Their measures included ensuring racial diversity in AI training datasets, creating helpful yet fair tools for data analysis, and regularly monitoring AI systems for biased outcomes. AI developers should consider ethics when developing and implementing healthcare technologies.</p><p>Regulations have not been established in many areas of healthcare. As the field of AI progresses rapidly, regulators are responsible for establishing effective policies to ensure quality and safety. According to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Romagnoli et al. (2024)</xref>, current regulations for healthcare are insufficient, underscoring the need for developing new policies as AI advances. It was pointed out that the primary goal of the rules should be to protect data, ensure safety, and hold people responsible so that everyone trusts AI systems in healthcare. This research references explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, such as attention mechanisms, as potential enhancements to improve transparency and facilitate model interpretability in future versions.</p>

Input in the form of data begins with the input layer. After inputs are received, they are passed through layers called convolutional layers and skip connections to help extract features and let the network learn from different features. A random forest model can process input features, and it uses parameters like the number of trees and the tree depth to boost its results. The data are subsequently passed through pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, followed by fully connected layers to integrate the extracted features. The results, which may be predictions or classifications important in healthcare, are provided by the output layer.</p>

      <p>The CXR dataset was moderately imbalanced with class distributions of 40% normal, 35% pneumonia, and 25% tuberculosis cases. Performance was further analyzed with F1-scores to evaluate results under imbalanced conditions. These methods, including DL and random forest, were applied to medical image classification and predictive analytics. Evaluation was conducted on the models, and the outcomes were compared to previous findings. For each task, detailed graphs and charts were provided, which highlight the accuracy and reliability of the proposed techniques, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.</p>

The comparison of the ROC curves among the CNN, ResNet-50, and VGG16 models is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> below.</p><p>The proposed CNN (skip connections) has a higher AUC, indicating better overall classification performance.

            <title>4.4. Discussion of results</title>
          
          <p>Both the image classification and predictive analytics models have proved to be very effective. With skip connections, the CNN model for medical image classification outperforms ResNet-50 and VGG16 in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, demonstrating its ability to identify meaningful information in medical images more effectively. Traditional models, such as logistic regression and SVM, cannot achieve the same level of accuracy as the random forest model, which further outperforms them in AUC-ROC, precision, and recall when used for patient outcome predictions. Additionally, results from the confusion matrix and precision-recall curve analyses confirm the effectiveness of the methods in handling imbalanced datasets, and both precision and recall are used to evaluate their performance. The feature-important analysis of the random forest model explains what factors play the most significant role in patient readmission, giving helpful information for medical decision-making.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>AI models that improve medical image classification and predictive analysis in healthcare were proposed and their performance was validated in this study. The focus was on leveraging AI and ML to facilitate more accurate diagnoses, predict patient outcomes, and provide personalized treatment plans. Compared to previous networks, the new model, a CNN with skip connections, achieved the highest accuracy (96.5%) and excellent precision (0.97), as indicated by the AUC-ROC value of 0.988. At the same time, the random forest model in predicting readmissions for patients achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.91, demonstrating its ability to predict harmful health outcomes for patients using their details. For practical validation, a pilot testing plan was outlined to deploy the system in three tertiary hospitals. Diagnostic speed, accuracy, clinical acceptance, and sample sizes exceeding 500 cases per site were considered in the evaluation.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study has limitations. Although the medical image classification dataset contains numerous examples, it is not very diverse, as most images are derived from the same source. Additionally, the performance of models can be compromised by limitations in data quality or integration, particularly when applied to real-world healthcare situations. Because the CNN model is challenging to interpret, clinicians continue to struggle with applying DL to medical decisions. In addition, the study did not focus sufficiently on ethical problems related to AI in healthcare, such as algorithmic bias and the privacy of patient information.</p><p>It is necessary to increase the dataset size by including more types of medical images and incorporating additional data (e.g., EHR and genomic) to enhance model performance across various cases. Efforts should be made to improve the interpretability of AI models, possibly through attention mechanisms or XAI, as this is crucial for healthcare professionals to utilize such systems effectively. Furthermore, testing these systems in hospitals and clinics would demonstrate their practical utility and the extent to which they can be widely applicable. Future research should incorporate bias-mitigation strategies, such as balanced sampling during model training and periodic algorithmic bias audits. These measures would improve fairness and trust in AI-driven healthcare applications.</p>
