      <abstract><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The study is carried out with the aim to investigate the barriers impacting the sustainable smart city planning and implementation of Intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This research study will contribute to the current knowledge by highlighting the main challenges that prevent the implementation of ITS for smart urban mobility. The findings demonstrate that various challenges, including management, resource-related, technical, economic, personal, interoperability, and individual factors hinders the successful implementation of ITS. The outcome of the findings holds few managerial implications. Policymakers and urban planners need to develop strategies that help resolve the identified challenges to guarantee the successful execution of ITS. Because of the proliferation of big data and the interconnectedness of vehicular, infrastructural, and pedestrian settings, acquiring, storing, and analyzing multi-source data has become easier and less expensive. The linked model brings new techniques to adaptable coordination and monitoring in real-time to better monitor and regulates transportation systems. IoT is developed, and it is now possible to integrate complicated solutions into existing frameworks and procedures for city administration. As the number of people who possess a vehicle rises, the difficulty of finding a parking spot and the consequent impact on air quality. New smart parking solutions must be developed to save time and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Smart parking solutions are the primary focus of this article, which emphasizes the available systems and sensors, as reported in the literature. This analysis aims to provide an in-depth detail at the development of smart transportation solutions. The inclusion of large vehicle detection technologies in a complete examination of the present state of smart parking systems should be a top priority. As a result, the communication modules are provided clearly and concisely.</p></abstract>
