      <abstract><p>In the Middle East, gas-fired heaters are conventionally favored due to their reliability, cost-effectiveness, and minimal environmental impact. However, the challenges associated with traditional designs, such as low thermal efficiency, high fuel consumption, emissions of environmental pollutants, indoor gas leakage, moisture absorption, uneven heat distribution, and non-compliance with design standards, necessitate innovative solutions. A novel gas-fired heater design is thus presented in this investigation, incorporating a double-walled chimney equipped with an intermediate ejector, blades, and a mesh plate. These components were integrated to enhance the overall performance by optimizing airflow dynamics, thereby improving efficiency and ensuring uniform flame formation. An experimental heater model was constructed, and a series of controlled experiments, along with Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, were performed. The thermal efficiency was found to improve by an average of 10% compared to conventional models, elevating the efficiency from 75% to 85%. This increase was attributed to the preheating of the inlet air in the double chimney, proper air distribution within the combustion chamber through mesh plate application, and the reduction of excess air volume by controlling the air inlet. Enhanced safety was also observed in the proposed design, with no exchange of air with the room, thereby alleviating concerns related to indoor gas leakage and moisture absorption. A minor trade-off was noted with a 3 ppm increase in nitrogen oxides ((NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions, an effect of reduced excess airflow to the combustion chamber; however, this was deemed acceptable in light of the substantial efficiency increase. Furthermore, the decreased natural gas consumption rendered the model economically attractive. Overall, the proposed gas-fired heater design offers significant potential for improving residential heating systems, addressing environmental issues, and maximizing energy savings, and is aligned with the global pursuit of energy-efficient and sustainable solutions.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Middle East, renowned for its abundant natural gas reserves, particularly in nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, has led to the prevalent use of gas-fired heaters. These heaters are fundamental in offering warmth to residential, commercial, and industrial spaces, owing to their cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability.</p>

            <title>1.1. First to third generation gas-fired heaters</title>
          
          <p>Historically, first-generation gas-fired heaters in the Middle East have been associated with certain limitations. Reliance on indoor air for combustion was found to cause uneven temperature distribution and even pose suffocation risks. In response, second-generation heaters were developed with fans to aid air exchange and ameliorate temperature distribution. Third-generation heaters introduced further advancements, including a double-wall chimney and external air sourcing for combustion, negating the need for indoor air. However, these designs necessitated specific building structures and chimney arrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Ventless gas-fired heaters emerged as an efficient alternative, operating without chimneys and even during power outages, although safety concerns have been observed in specific environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p>

            <title>1.2. Existing research and limitations</title>
          
          <p>Extensive studies on gas-fired heaters have explored combustion processes and efficiency. Faulkner's investigation calculated the stoichiometric air ratio for various heaters, revealing that the air influx during combustion in conventional gas-fired boilers was about four times the stoichiometric requirement, significantly affecting efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Traynor et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] evaluated oxygen consumption and emissions from ventless heaters, identifying potential air quality issues due to occasional exceedance of pollutant concentrations over guidelines. Woodring et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] subsequently addressed these concerns by establishing dilution ventilation requirements, and Setini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] demonstrated that natural ventilation could maintain optimal temperature and carbon dioxide concentration.</p><p>Efforts to optimize efficiency-related parameters in gas-fired heaters have been undertaken. Bekele et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] analyzed the influence of obstacles on thermal performance, noting an enhancement in the Nusselt number, albeit at the cost of increased pressure drop.</p>

            <title>1.3. Novel heater design</title>
          
          <p>This investigation introduces a groundbreaking heater design that addresses the constraints of existing models. By employing a double-wall chimney coupled with an ejector system to supply combustion air from external and ambient sources without the need for electrical suction, the entry of toxic gases into the room is effectively prevented. Furthermore, the inclusion of a specialized air distributor was found to augment combustion and minimize environmental pollutants. The strategic incorporation of blades within the combustion chamber enhances heat transfer, thereby boosting the heater's overall efficiency.</p>

      <title>3. The proposed design</title>

          <p>At the core of the proposed design lies the combination of a double-walled chimney and an intermediate ejector, facilitating the intake and preheating of external air. This mechanism eradicates the need for indoor air combustion, thereby addressing the primary limitation of first-generation heaters. Notably, the absence of any electrical devices or fans for air suction into the combustion chamber differentiates this design from its predecessors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Safety is prioritized through the prevention of air or combustion products entering the room, and gas pilot wires sealed with non-combustible material at the heater's base are introduced to eliminate air leakage.</p>

            <title>3.2. Suction force mitigation</title>
          
          <p>To tackle the challenge of suction forces in the vicinity of the ejector, a fine hole with a diameter of 1 cm is strategically incorporated at the midpoint of the ejector throat. This alleviates turbulence and pressure fluctuations, thus enhancing the stability of airflow dynamics. The hole serves as a pressure relief mechanism, mitigating the negative effects of suction forces while preserving the efficiency of the ejector.</p>

          <p>Blades are integrated within the design to reduce outlet velocity and absorb flow energy, thereby optimizing heat transfer. Such enhancement in thermal performance has been previously identified as beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Further, the employment of a mesh plate beneath the burner ensures uniform flame formation and offsets potential imbalances caused by the uneven distribution of incoming air. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> presents the applied mesh plate in the heater. The diffusion property of the mesh plate encourages a well-mixed air-fuel ratio across the burner surface, leading to a more consistent combustion process.</p>

          <p>Strategically positioned holes near the air inlet in the plate regulate incoming air velocity, thus avoiding uneven distribution as it enters the combustion chamber. The incorporation of chamfered nozzles with varying diameters facilitates suction-driven creation of these holes. These innovative features contribute to optimal combustion conditions, which, in turn, minimize the production of harmful byproducts such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. This promotes a safer and more environmentally sustainable operation.</p>

          <p>The oxygen percentage in the air, typically around 22% under standard conditions, also plays a critical role in determining combustion efficiency. Higher oxygen concentrations can foster more complete combustion, leading to increased energy release and reduced formation of harmful byproducts. Conversely, lower oxygen levels can induce incomplete combustion, resulting in reduced efficiency and increased emissions. Therefore, achieving the right balance between excess air and oxygen concentration becomes essential for optimal combustion performance and minimal environmental impacts.</p>

As depicted in subgraph (A) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, upon collision with the initial blade, the flow is seen to bifurcate into two streams, thereby generating two fluid jets on opposing sides of the blade. This Figure distinctly highlights the ensuing formation of vortices and turbulence trailing the blades. In further detail, the right segment of subgraph (B) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> showcases the flow subjected to intense rotational activity within the conduits linking the furnace to the adjustment chamber.</p>

          <p>A comparative examination of temperature distribution on the heater, both with and without blades, is exhibited in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. The outcomes unambiguously underscore the instrumental role of blades in the attainment of elevated temperatures within the designated region. This elevation in temperature is markedly conspicuous in the immediate vicinity of the blades, an area where jet formation is evident. Such an occurrence is indicative of the blades' capacity to amplify both heat transfer and the underlying fluid dynamics within the system. Notably, simulation data disclosed a significant 12-degree augmentation in the average temperature on the heater surface when blades were incorporated.</p><p>Within this specific heater configuration, the strategic introduction of obstacles was observed to boost fluid velocity, subsequently instigating vortexes and turbulence. Such flow perturbations were found to disrupt the boundary layer, thereby leading to a surge in heat flux coupled with a rise in surface temperature. Moreover, the curtailment of jet expansion and the ensuing reduction in velocity post-obstacle traversal contributed to the prolongation of hot gas residence within the chamber. This facilitated more effective heat transfer, culminating in the realization of an enhanced overall efficiency for the heater.</p><p>The aforestated results lend credence to the hypothesis that the integration of blades within the heater architecture can have a pronounced effect on the thermal efficiency of the system. By modulating fluid dynamics and optimizing heat transfer mechanisms, the blades serve as an effective means to both conserve energy and enhance performance. Further studies could extend this investigation by exploring variations in blade design and material composition to ascertain their effects on system efficiency and reliability. Additionally, real-world experimental validation of the simulation findings may yield further insights into the practical applicability of these design enhancements.</p>

          <p>Traditional gas-fired heaters, marked by their simplistic design featuring a lone gas burner body without a double-walled chimney, and characterized by separate inlets for air intake and product exhaust, offer a starting point for the study of thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiency, as defined, represents the ratio of the total energy produced by natural gas to the energy loss through the chimney. This ratio is represented by the following expression:</p>

These were measured with the TESTO 330-1 LX gas analyzer.</p><p>An advance in the understanding of heater efficiency was facilitated through the application of thermodynamic equations and the use of the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. By enabling a detailed exploration of variations in chimney temperature and excess air percentage, these tools facilitated quantification of their impacts on overall performance. In this study, a program developed in the EES environment was employed to examine the design heater. Numerical and operational data pertaining to the designed heater are elaborated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.

The incorporation of elements such as a double chimney with an ejector, blades, and meshed plate distinguishes the designed heater from its conventional counterpart. This augmentation in efficiency not only translates into reduced energy consumption and lower operational costs but also yields environmental advantages. The reduction in energy requirements consequentially lowers greenhouse gas emissions, offering a multi-dimensional benefit that spans economic and ecological realms.</p>

              <p>An increase in the amount of excess air was observed to enhance the mixing of fuel and air, thus facilitating complete combustion. Conversely, negative consequences on the efficiency of the heater were also noted:</p><p>• An increase in excess air levels was found to decrease the temperature of combustion products. This phenomenon is attributable to the larger volume of air molecules absorbing the energy released from the fuel reaction, resulting in a decrease in the temperature of the combustion products. A subsequent decline in the furnace walls' temperature was also observed, leading to reduced heat transfer from the heater to the environment via convection and radiation. Cumulatively, these factors contributed to a reduction in the thermal efficiency of the heater.</p><p>• Furthermore, a higher percentage of excess air was shown to augment the flow of hot gases in the chimney, culminating in heat loss and a significant diminishment in heater efficiency.</p>

</inline-formula>). Under conventional conditions, excess air was observed to adversely affect the efficiency of gas heaters. However, directing the precise amount of air needed for combustion into the heater, and having it exit the chimney under identical temperature conditions, was found to enhance thermal efficiency to approximately 97.50%, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

              <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>, developed in the EES, a decrease in exhaust temperature was found to increase heater efficiency. Nevertheless, a reduction in the draft force of the chimney was also observed, which may pose a risk of combustion products flowing back into the room. Critical consideration must be given to ensure that combustion products do not reach the dew point temperature before exiting the chimney, as the production of corrosive acids may ensue. Consequently, a certain threshold must be maintained for the exit temperature of the output products.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this study, a novel design for a gas heater, particularly tailored for residential applications, was introduced. Several innovative features were incorporated to enhance performance, leading to the following key findings:</p><p>• Design Advancements: The combustion chamber was equipped with blades that were found to disrupt the boundary layer and prolong the residence time of hot gas. This innovation was observed to enhance heat transfer. Meshed plates were implemented below the burner to ensure better distribution of inlet air for efficient combustion. A double-walled chimney, aimed at preheating the inlet air and minimizing excess air, was also employed, while an ejector was integrated to obviate the need for a fan. Collectively, these design advancements contributed to a 10% increase in the efficiency of the heater, improving the overall efficiency from 75% to 85%.</p><p>• Efficiency Considerations: A close correlation between the heater's efficiency, the exit temperature of chimney gases, and the percentage of excess air in the combustion chamber was identified. While an increase in excess air was found to facilitate complete combustion, excessive amounts were noted to negatively impact efficiency. Conversely, a reduction in exhaust temperature was observed to increase efficiency, albeit with potential risks such as a pressure drop and the formation of corrosive acids.</p><p>• Safety and Environmental Concerns: The proposed model was designed to mitigate issues such as carbon monoxide leakage and moisture absorption from the room. By providing combustion air exclusively from outside, safer and more reliable operation was achieved, thus rendering the model suitable for residential use. The emissions of pollutants, such as <inline-formula>

The innovations incorporated into the design have addressed limitations in conventional gas-fired heaters, resulting in enhanced efficiency, safety, and environmental compatibility. Future studies could focus on further optimizing the design and conducting comprehensive real-world trials to validate the efficacy of the proposed model.</p>
