      <abstract><p>The effective integration of renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar and wind power, into smart grids is essential for advancing sustainable energy management. Hybrid inverters play a pivotal role in the conversion and distribution of this energy, but conventional approaches, including Static Resource Allocation (SRA) and Fixed Threshold Inverter Control (FTIC), frequently encounter inefficiencies, particularly in managing fluctuating renewable energy inputs and adapting to variable load demands. These inefficiencies lead to increased energy loss and a reduction in overall system performance. In response to these challenges, the Optimized Energy Storage and Hybrid Inverter Management Algorithm (OESHIMA) has been developed, employing machine learning for real-time data analysis and decision-making. By continuously monitoring energy production, storage capacity, and consumption patterns, OESHIMA dynamically optimizes energy allocation and inverter operations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that OESHIMA enhances energy efficiency by 0.25% and reduces energy loss by 0.20% when benchmarked against conventional methods. Furthermore, the algorithm extends the lifespan of energy storage systems by 0.15%, contributing to both sustainable and cost-efficient energy management within smart grids. These findings underscore the potential of OESHIMA in addressing the limitations of traditional energy management systems (EMSs) while improving hybrid inverter performance in the context of renewable energy integration.</p></abstract>

            <title>1.1. Research gaps</title>
          
          <p>Despite the advancements in hybrid photovoltaic (PV) storage systems and energy management, several research gaps remain that need to be addressed to further optimize these systems. One significant gap is the challenge of dynamically adapting to variable load demands. Existing EMSs often struggle to efficiently handle rapid fluctuations in energy consumption, which can lead to inefficiencies. Research is needed to develop more adaptive EMS algorithms that can predict and respond to these changes in real-time, thereby enhancing overall system performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another area that requires attention is the integration of multiple RES within a single hybrid system. Most current systems focus on solar PV and battery storage, with limited integration of other renewable sources like wind or biomass. Exploring how to effectively design systems that manage energy from multiple sources simultaneously presents a valuable research opportunity. Additionally, the accuracy of energy generation forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy storage and distribution. However, existing methods may not fully account for sudden weather changes, suggesting a need for more precise forecasting models, possibly leveraging machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>Another critical research area is to optimize battery storage utilization and extend its lifespan. While batteries are essential for energy storage, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on advanced battery management techniques that can optimize charging/discharging cycles and predict maintenance needs to reduce degradation and improve performance. Furthermore, the lack of standardization and interoperability among different EMS technologies and smart grid components poses integration challenges. Developing standardized protocols that ensure seamless communication and operation across various systems could significantly enhance efficiency. Scalability is also a concern, as scaling hybrid PV storage systems for larger applications, such as commercial or industrial use, remains complex and costly. Research could focus on finding cost-effective solutions that maintain high performance while enabling broader deployment. Additionally, as smart grids increasingly rely on real-time data communication, cybersecurity and data privacy have become critical issues. Addressing these vulnerabilities through research can ensure the secure and reliable operation of EMSs, safeguarding sensitive user data from cyber threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>Lastly, the environmental impact of battery production, usage, and disposal is an area that requires more research. Developing sustainable energy storage solutions, such as environmentally friendly batteries or alternative storage technologies with lower ecological footprints, is essential for reducing the overall environmental impact of these systems. Addressing these research gaps can contribute to the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable hybrid PV storage systems, advancing the broader adoption of renewable energy technologies in smart grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p>

          <p>Recent trends in smart grid technologies are significantly shaped by the integration of machine learning and AI for optimizing energy management. These advanced techniques allow for predictive analytics, which greatly improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts and renewable energy generation predictions. AI-driven algorithms facilitate real-time decision-making, enhancing the adaptability of energy storage and inverter systems to dynamic grid conditions. Additionally, there is a notable shift towards hybrid energy systems that integrate multiple renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and biomass. This diversification of the energy mix enhances the reliability and efficiency of energy supply by optimizing the use of available resources. Another key trend is the advancement of smart inverter technology, which now includes sophisticated control algorithms like OESHIMA. These smart inverters not only efficiently convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) but also support grid operations by providing voltage regulation, frequency control, and reactive power compensation.</p><p>Energy storage optimization is also gaining prominence, with recent efforts focusing on maximizing the utilization and longevity of battery storage systems. Techniques such as adaptive battery management and predictive maintenance are employed to reduce battery degradation, extend lifespan, and enhance overall system performance. Real-time monitoring and control have become essential aspects of modern smart grids, facilitated by IoT devices and advanced communication protocols. These systems dynamically adjust operations based on real-time data regarding energy generation, consumption, and storage conditions, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency. In addition, there is growing emphasis on sustainability and cybersecurity within smart grid components, including energy storage and inverters. Environmentally friendly energy storage solutions are being actively researched to enhance sustainability, while advanced cybersecurity measures are being developed to safeguard critical grid data and operations from potential cyber threats. </p><p>The applications of these technologies are diverse and impactful. In residential settings, hybrid inverters and energy management algorithms are increasingly utilized to manage solar PV systems and battery storage, allowing homeowners to maximize self-consumption of generated energy, reduce grid dependency, and lower energy costs. In industrial and commercial buildings, these technologies optimize energy usage, mitigate peak demand charges, and integrate RES more effectively, thereby maintaining power quality and reliability. Hybrid inverters and advanced EMSs are also crucial in microgrids and remote areas where stable energy supply is essential and grid connectivity is often limited. These technologies enable efficient local energy management, ensuring stability and reducing the need for costly grid expansions.</p><p>Furthermore, the integration of smart inverters and energy storage optimization extends to electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, where they help manage loads, optimize charging times, and balance supply-demand dynamically based on grid conditions. At the utility scale, hybrid inverters and algorithms like OESHIMA are employed in large-scale solar and wind farms to manage energy flow, stabilize grid operations, and facilitate the efficient integration of renewable energy into the main power grid. These applications underscore the importance of smart grid technologies in enhancing energy efficiency, reliability, and sustainability across various contexts of energy management.</p>

      <title>3. Proposed architecture of the oeshima in a smart grid system</title>
      <p>The proposed system, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, integrates RES such as SPV panels and wind turbines with a BES system to create a highly efficient and reliable energy management solution. The system is centered around the OESHIMA, which leverages real-time data and machine learning techniques to dynamically manage energy flow within a smart grid environment. At the core of the system, the DC bus acts as a central hub where electricity generated by the solar PV panels and wind turbines is collected. This energy, initially in DC form, is then routed to multiple inverters, which convert it into AC suitable for household use or for feeding back into the power grid. The inverters operate in coordination with each other, allowing for flexibility and redundancy in energy conversion. The system's BES plays a critical role by storing excess energy during periods of low demand, ensuring that this energy can be used later when demand increases or when renewable generation is insufficient. The battery management block within OESHIMA optimizes the charging and discharging cycles of the battery, maximizing its efficiency and lifespan.</p>

      <p>The EMS, which serves as the brain of the operation, continuously monitors inputs from the RES, battery storage, and the power grid. It makes real-time decisions on how to distribute energy most efficiently, balancing the needs of the household load with the availability of renewable energy and stored power. The EMS uses predictive analytics to forecast future energy demand and renewable generation, enabling proactive and optimized energy management.</p><p>To ensure seamless operation, the system includes a communication and integration block, which manages data exchange between the EMS, the household smart meter, and other system components. This block also facilitates interaction with the external power grid, allowing the system to transition smoothly between operating independently (islanded mode) and being connected to the grid (grid-tied mode). Furthermore, the system incorporates fault detection and resilience mechanisms, which continuously monitor for any inefficiencies or faults in the system. If an issue is detected, the system can automatically adjust its operations, such as switching energy sources or modifying inverter settings, to maintain uninterrupted service.</p><p>Overall, the OESHIMA system significantly enhances energy efficiency, reduces reliance on the power grid, and supports the integration of RES into the household energy supply. By employing advanced optimization techniques and real-time data processing, the system ensures a reliable and sustainable energy infrastructure, contributing to the broader adoption of smart grid technologies.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the OESHIMA in overcoming the limitations of conventional methods like SRA and FTIC. As highlighted in the abstract, these traditional approaches often struggle with inefficiencies in energy distribution and adaptability to fluctuating renewable energy inputs. By leveraging machine learning and real-time data processing, OESHIMA successfully addresses these issues. The algorithm's ability to dynamically adjust inverter settings and optimize energy distribution led to a notable reduction in energy loss by approximately 0.20% and an improvement in overall system efficiency by 0.25% compared to conventional methods. Additionally, the enhanced adaptability of OESHIMA contributes to extending the lifespan of energy storage systems by 0.15%, further supporting sustainable and cost-effective energy management in smart grids. These outcomes validate the potential of OESHIMA in advancing the integration of RES within smart grids, paving the way for more resilient and efficient energy infrastructures.</p>

          <p>The future scope includes expanding OESHIMA to integrate more renewable sources like biomass and hydropower, developing AI-driven battery management for better performance, and ensuring scalability and interoperability across smart grid systems. Strengthening cybersecurity and data privacy is crucial, along with exploring sustainable energy storage solutions. Research should also focus on real-time adaptive control systems to enhance efficiency and tailor OESHIMA for cost-effective implementation in developing regions.</p>
