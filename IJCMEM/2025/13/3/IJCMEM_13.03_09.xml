      <abstract><p>Heat pumps are widely recognized as the most cost-effective solution for decarbonizing the building sector. Their ability to provide both heating and cooling with a single system is especially relevant in today’s context of rising temperatures due to global warming. This work describes a new experimental setup and presents initial results on the performance of an air-to-water heat pump operating with the low-GWP refrigerant R454B in a pilot Zero Energy Building. The system has been equipped with research-grade instrumentation to monitor key parameters in both the refrigerant and hydraulic loops. This paper presents the monitoring system and a thermodynamic model of the building based on RC analogy, which will be compared to the experimental data. These experimental results and the thermodynamic model will serve as the basis for training an AI tool dedicated to the optimal energy management of complex renewable energy systems, from single buildings to energy communities.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The new Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD IV), published in 2024, imposes the ambitious goal of decarbonising Europe's building stock by 2050, through national plans for zero-emission renovation of the residential and non-residential building stock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Among the possible ways to achieve this goal, the electrification of the built environment represents an important driver; in fact, electrification consists in replacing fossil-fueled technologies with devices powered by renewable energy sources, thus leading to a reduction in climate-changing emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. European directives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] emphasize the role of heat pump technology in integrating renewable energy for heating and cooling. In 2022, nearly 20 million heat pumps were installed across Europe—with France and Italy leading the adoption—yet gas boilers still dominate the market, accounting for about 84% of installations. This disparity poses a significant challenge to meet the sustainability targets established by the Paris Agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>The combination with renewable energy production systems such as photovoltaics, coupled with energy storage systems, is an effective solution to reduce building consumption, maximise self-consumption and minimise costs by taking advantage of any available incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Moreover, these technologies find wide application in the context of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>In response to the growing complexity of contemporary energy systems and the temporal mismatch between building energy demands and peak photovoltaic output, the implementation of dedicated control strategies is indispensable. Such strategies are pivotal for optimizing on‐site energy utilization and, in turn, realizing both energy and cost savings. The integration of electrical and thermal storage technologies plays a key role in effective energy management, as these storage solutions enable decoupling of energy generation from consumption. In this framework, the Zero Energy Building laboratory (LAB-Zeb) at the Construction Technologies Institute of the National Research Council (ITC-CNR) in San Giuliano Milanese functions as a living laboratory for the evaluation of advanced building‐sector innovations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Equipped with photovoltaic arrays, solar thermal collectors, heat pumps, and battery systems, the facility has been instrumented—under the PNRR-funded RAISE project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]—with a research-grade monitoring platform that records HVAC temperatures, heat fluxes, and the electrical consumption of all installed components.</p><p>Advanced control strategies should optimize the processes of energy production, storage and utilization. To achieve this, a reliable but fast forecast is required for all the main energy loads. For this reason, the thermodynamic models of building based on the electrical resistance-capacitance (RC) analogy can offer an interesting trade-off between accuracy and complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>This paper describes in detail the new monitoring system installed in the LAB-Zeb and presents a new thermodynamic model of the building, based on the electrical RC model and validated against TRNSYS. The experimental data and the RC model will be the basis for training a control system adopting AI techniques to optimize the energy management of complex systems, from single buildings to energy communities.</p>

      <title>2. Monitoring system</title>
      <p>As aforementioned, the laboratory is located in San Giuliano Milanese (Milan, Northern Italy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. It consists of a one floor building for office use of 45 m<sup>2</sup>, divided in two heated and cooled rooms and one technical room, where the main HVAC appliances are installed. Within the project RAISE, the building has been refurbished to drastically reduced the energy demand: rockwool insulation layers were applied to every external envelope component (walls, roof and ground slab). Additionally, one wall was also equipped with a ventilated façade, and new high performance windows were installed. A layout of the building is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
      
        <fig id="fig_1">

        </fig>
      
      <p>Moreover, the whole HVAC system has been improved with the installation of an air-to-water heat pump serving the radiant floor and two fan coils, a new solar thermal collector for domestic hot water (DHW) production, and a photovoltaic system of 3 kW of peak production equipped with two electrical batteries of 5 kWh each. It is highlighting that the installed heat pump is based on the refrigerant R454B, which is low global warming mixture (GWP = 466) of R32 and R1234yf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. </p><p>The main objective of RAISE is developing and testing an advanced control system based on AI techniques to optimize the energy consumption of the building under different scenarios, such as stand-alone photovoltaic production and prosumer within a Renewable Energy Community (REC). In particular, the AI control system will make decisions on whether to store energy in the batteries, directly use the PV production or the national grid for energy supply, based on model for weather, consumption and energy cost forecast. For these reasons, a sofisticated monitoring system was installed to measure all the main electrical loads of the building by means of several wattmeters. Since the heating and cooling of the building represents the highest electrical load, particular attention has been paid to monitoring the heat pump and whole hydronic system. A monitoring system consisting of research-level instruments has been installed to measure the most relevant quantity involved in the thermodynamic cycle, also within the refrigerant loop of the heat pump.</p>

            <title>3.1. Model assumptions</title>
          
          <p>A thermodynamic model based on the electrical RC analogy has been developed. RC models employ equivalent resistances and capacities to implement the phenomena of heat transfer and thermal inertia, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. In the literature, a number of studies are dedicated to such models, and it is worth highlighting two important standards, VDI 6007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] and EN52016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], which describes two calculation procedures based on RC models. In general, RC models can be distinguished by the nomenclature mRnC, where m and n represent the number of resistances and capacities considered in model. However, such nomenclature may result confusing since it does not specify if the number of RC parameters refers to a single wall, a single thermal zone or the whole building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. </p><p>Within the RC model developed in this work, every single wall (including floors and ceilings) have been modelled as 3R2C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> shows the model scheme of the single wall. The three resistances are the internal and external surface resistances (<inline-formula>

During such period of time, a fixed setpoint temperature of 20℃ was assumed: at every time step, the room temperature was calculated based on the heating/cooling loads of the building, if the room temperature was lower than the setpoint, this was set equal to 20℃ and the heating demand was calculated, otherwise the temperature was free to vary.</p><p>The same building was modelled with TRNSYS, considering the same boundary conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows the comparison between the instantaneous heating demand calculated with TRNSYS with respect to the RC model. Within the simulated 60 days, the energy demand calculated with TRNSYS was equal to 1,255.7 kWh, while the same was equal to 1,306.0 kWh with the RC model, which corresponds to an overestimation of 4.0%. Considering the limitation already highlighted in the literature for the RC models, such result can be considered satisfying.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this work, a comprehensive experimental monitoring platform and a fast, yet accurate, thermodynamic model of a Zero Energy Building (ZEB) laboratory have been presented. The monitoring system—comprising high‐accuracy PT100 temperature probes, piezoresistive pressure transducers, Coriolis flow meters in the refrigerant loop, and electromagnetic flow meters in the hydronic loop—enables simultaneous tracking of the key parameters governing the heat pump cycle and the building’s thermal behavior. These detailed measurements will form the foundation for data‐driven AI algorithms aimed at optimizing the energy management of both single buildings and larger renewable energy communities.</p><p>The thermodynamic model, based on a resistance–capacitance (RC) network built with a 3R2C wall representation and an RC model for each thermal zone, was validated against TRNSYS simulations. Over a 60-day winter period under controlled setpoint conditions, the RC model predicted a heating energy demand of 1,306.0 kWh compared to 1,255.7 kWh from TRNSYS, corresponding to an overestimation of only 4.0%. This level of accuracy, combined with the significantly lower computational burden of the RC approach, confirms its suitability for real‐time forecasting and control purposes. When applied to the LAB-Zeb, the model estimated annual demands of 724.7 kWh for Room 1 and 492.2 kWh for Room 2, demonstrating the model’s capability for detailed, zone‐level energy assessment.</p><p>Looking ahead, the integration of this experimental dataset with the validated RC model will enable the training of advanced AI controllers capable of making real‐time decisions on energy production, storage, and consumption. By leveraging short‐term forecasts of weather, occupancy, and electricity prices, the AI tool will optimize heat pump operation, photovoltaic self‐consumption, and battery charging/discharging strategies. The next phase of this research will involve the deployment of the AI controller in the LAB-Zeb, continuous collection of operational data, and iterative refinement of both model parameters and control logic to achieve optimal performance under various scenarios, including stand-alone operation and participation in Renewable Energy Communities.</p>
