      <abstract><p>Two-wheeled self-balancing vehicles inherently exhibit nonlinear, unstable, and strongly coupled dynamic characteristics, and their analysis and control remain of substantial relevance to military, industrial, and intelligent transportation applications. To address these challenges, a Bluetooth-enabled self-balancing vehicle system was designed with enhanced sensing, estimation, and hierarchical control capabilities. An improved Kalman filter (KF) algorithm was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional sensor fusion approaches. In the proposed method, gyroscope and accelerometer measurements were adaptively fused, enabling higher accuracy in attitude estimation while suppressing cumulative drift and transient disturbances. On this basis, a hierarchical proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control strategy was formulated to enhance responsiveness, stability, and tunability. Optimal attitude angles and reference velocities were processed within this framework to generate pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals for motor actuation. In parallel, a Bluetooth module was integrated to receive real-time commands from a mobile application, enabling precise execution of forward motion, reverse motion, and differential steering maneuvers. Experimental validation demonstrated that the system maintained stable posture, resisted external perturbations, responded rapidly to mobile control inputs, and executed commanded trajectories with high accuracy. The overall performance indicates that the proposed design provides a reliable and scalable platform for self-balancing vehicle research and offers potential applicability in human-robot interaction, intelligent mobility, and adaptive control studies.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years, two-wheeled self-balancing vehicles have been favored by more and more green travel enthusiasts due to their advantages of energy saving, environmental protection, simple structure, flexible operation, and convenient carrying, and have now become an important branch of mobile robot research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle system, as an important part of the intelligent vehicle system, has also attracted much attention due to its nonlinear, highly unstable, and strong coupling characteristics.</p><p>In the vehicle’s self-balancing control process, the accuracy and real-time performance of the body attitude inclination measurement determine the control performance. Relying on the gyroscope or accelerometer only leads to large measurement error and vibration interference, often failing to meet the self-balancing control requirements of a two-wheeled vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the study of data fusion algorithms that effectively remove the interference of sensor data has also become the focus of research. The Kalman filter (KF) algorithm is widely used as the basis of many attitude data fusion methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Wei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] proposed a KF fusion algorithm based on a data iterative method. In this algorithm, the output of the multisensor data fusion is introduced into the system again for iterative fusion filtering. Zhu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] used extended KF to realize the information fusion of the accelerometer and gyroscope. In the study by Srichandan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], the angle output of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is provided to the KF, and its output is used as the input of Q-learning to achieve more precise balance control. The complementary filter (CF) is also widely used in two-wheeled self-balancing vehicles due to its ability to effectively eliminate the gyroscope drift, suppress the high-frequency perturbation of the accelerometer, reduce the dynamic error of the output attitude angle, and improve the angle measurement precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] used CF to fuse and optimize the inclination and acceleration sensor measurement value, thus obtaining the optimal estimation value which is consistent with the actual attitude information. After CF processed the output data of the gyroscope and accelerometer and the weighted average operation was performed, the cross compensation was used for correction according to the measurement error.</p><p>In addition, various control algorithms have been studied to solve the self-balancing and motion control problems of the vehicle. Unluturk and Aydogdu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] proposed an adaptive fuzzy logic proportional–integral (PI) controller based on artificial neural network (ANN). Kim and Kwon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] proposed a control scheme based on the state-dependent Riccati equation. Xu and Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] proposed a design methodology for the one-dimensional cloud model controller. Guo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] used a completely online, feedback-based Q-learning to achieve optimal control of a balancing robot, with both state feedback and output feedback considered. At present, the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control algorithm has been widely used because of its simple principle, easy design, and independent parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. However, this algorithm also has shortcomings. It is mainly suitable for the basic linear and dynamic characteristics that do not change with the time control system. And the controller parameters mainly rely on manual debugging because it is time-consuming. Therefore, it is difficult for the PID controller to achieve precise control of the vehicle for a long time.</p><p>To improve the control effect of the PID controller in self-balancing vehicle systems, Singh and Bhushan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] revised the transition probability of the ant colony optimization (ACO) and obtained an improved ACO, which in turn optimized the PID controller and obtained its optimal tuning parameters. Jiang and He [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] proposed an active disturbance rejection control strategy, which is tuned by an adaptive differential evolution algorithm, for the self-balancing control part of the vehicle and designed a PID control strategy incorporating the transient process for the steering control part. Shen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] designed the controller using the neuronal PID control algorithm. Ren and Zhou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] proposed a cascade coupling control scheme based on the PID control algorithm. The speed loop and balance loop in the classical parallel coupling control method were decoupled to remove the independent speed PID control, with the former being set as the outer loop and the latter being set as the inner loop to realize the coupling. Pang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] proposed an adaptive sliding mode attitude control scheme by combining the minimum parameter learning method with the radial basis function neural network. Anisimov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] designed a fuzzy proportional–derivative (PD) controller based on the relation model and optimized the scaling factors of the controller using the cross-entropy optimization method. Ren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] proposed a fuzzy controller with learning ability based on the fuzzy rule and the operant conditioning (OC) learning mechanism, enabling the self-balancing vehicle to learn and obtain the fuzzy control rules autonomously and realize the automation of controller design.</p><p>To obtain accurate attitude information of the current vehicle body, an improved KF algorithm was adopted in this current study based on the measurement’s iterative update to fuse the output data of the gyroscope and accelerometer. In addition, the prior covariance matrix modified by the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) method was introduced at the beginning of the iteration for updating. For the control problem, an improved PID control algorithm was designed based on the hierarchical control strategy. In the balance control layer, the angular velocity loop was strung into the angle loop. In the speed control layer, a control algorithm based on weighted PI was designed. Accurate control of speed was realized by adjusting the change speed of accumulation and the degree of response to the error. In the steering control layer, a controller output update algorithm based on weighted PD was designed. A certain degree of feedback control was introduced into the steering output, and finally a limiting operation was performed on the steering control output. The rest of this study is organized below. Sections 2 and 3 introduce the hardware and software design of the system. Section 4 presents the principle and design of the improved KF. Section 5 explains the improved PID algorithm in terms of balance, speed and direction control. Section 6 simulates and analyzes the improved KF and PID algorithms and tests the system. Section 7 concludes this study.</p><p>In the process of accurately acquiring the real-time attitude of a self-balancing vehicle in dynamic operation, traditional KF methods are often affected by estimation errors when sensor noise is time-varying or abnormal disturbances occur. To overcome this limitation, a measurement-driven iteratively updated KF algorithm was used in this study to fuse the outputs of the gyroscope and accelerometer. During the iterative initialization phase, a prior covariance matrix corrected by the L-M method was introduced, which enhanced the robustness of the algorithm against initial errors and improved the convergence speed and accuracy of attitude estimation. In terms of the control strategy, the insufficient adjustment capability of the traditional PID control in multi-task coupled scenarios for self-balancing vehicles was addressed through an improved PID control algorithm designed based on hierarchical control principles. At the balance control layer, a composite structure was adopted in which an angular velocity loop was integrated into an angular position loop to suppress attitude oscillation and improve disturbance rejection capability. At the velocity control layer, a weighted PI controller was designed to achieve precise speed control by adjusting the integral term's rate of change and the sensitivity to errors. At the direction control layer, a weighted PD-based controller output update algorithm was developed, incorporating a certain degree of feedback control into the steering output, while output limiting was applied to ensure smooth steering maneuvers.</p>

      <title>2. System hardware design</title>
      <p>The system’s hardware block diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The system hardware mainly consists of a microprocessor, an attitude sensor module, a motor drive module, a Hall encoder module, and a master-slave integrated Bluetooth module. Among them, the attitude sensor is used to collect the inclination and angular velocity data of the self-balancing vehicle. The encoder is responsible for measuring the speed and direction of the direct current (DC) motor. As a high-performance, low-power 8-bit AVR microprocessor, ATmega328P is used to receive and process the data collected by the sensor module and then output the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal to the motor drive module. At the same time, the microprocessor can also receive the control command of the mobile phone through Bluetooth, enabling forward motion, reverse motion, and steering. The main components of the system and their circuit design are explained below.</p>

            <title>2.1. Bluetooth module</title>
          
          <p>The HC-06 Bluetooth module is equipped with both master and slave functionality and operates using the Bluetooth 2.0 serial protocol. An integrated printed circuit board (PCB) antenna is incorporated to ensure stable wireless communication within a range of approximately eight meters. In comparison to the HC-05 module, the HC-06 is configured to start up in the slave mode by default, which simplifies the initial setup process. The corresponding circuit diagram of the Bluetooth module is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. Under typical operating conditions, a data transmission bandwidth of about 1 Mbps is achieved by this module, with communication latency generally ranging from several tens to hundreds of milliseconds. The actual performance values are determined by the communication environment and the size of data packets. To prevent the Bluetooth module from occupying the hardware serial port and thereby blocking the program upload via USB, a switch is used to control the activation of the Bluetooth output pin. The switch should be closed during Bluetooth communication and opened when the microcontroller is being programmed.</p>

          <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The MPU6050 is a six-axis motion sensor that integrates a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer, with communication performed via an inter-integrated circuit (I²C) interface. To accommodate different motion environments, the sensor's measurement range can be defined by the user. The accelerometer range can be set to ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, or ±16g, while the gyroscope range can be selected from ±250°/s, ±500°/s, ±1000°/s, or ±2000°/s. The circuit of the MPU6050 attitude sensor is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. To prevent circuit damage caused by transient pulse voltages that may exceed the rated output voltage during power supply interference, a 0.1 μF decoupling capacitor is connected between the power supply and ground terminals. As these pulse voltages are high-frequency signals, they are filtered out by the decoupling capacitor, thereby protecting subsequent circuits.</p>

          <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The TB6612 motor driver module is characterized by excellent power amplification performance. When the input remains within the rated operating range (typically VM ≤ 15 V and output current per channel ≤ 1.2 A), minimal heat is generated by the chip. The module supports PWM control frequencies of up to 100 kHz and is compatible with both 3.3 V and 5 V logic level systems. The circuit of the motor driver module is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. A 220 μF electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel at the power supply input. This capacitor is primarily used to buffer current fluctuations caused by motor start/stop events and sudden load changes, while voltage dips and high-frequency noise induced by line inductance are suppressed. As a result, the supply voltage is effectively stabilized and noise is filtered out.</p>

          <p>The Hall encoder operates based on the Hall effect, through which angular displacement information from the motor shaft is converted into two square wave signals with a fixed phase difference (typically 90). By detecting edges and counting pulses from these two orthogonal signals, the motor's rotation direction, angular velocity, and relative displacement can be determined. This module is characterized by a typical resolution of 11 pulses per revolution (PPR) and a maximum response frequency that typically exceeds 100 kHz, with digital-level output signals provided. The interface circuit for a dual-wheel Hall encoder is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, where typical configurations for power decoupling and signal output terminals are illustrated.</p>

      <p>The software architecture of the self-balancing vehicle system is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>. Upon system startup, the serial port and all peripheral modules are first initialized. Raw acceleration and angular velocity data are obtained by the attitude acquisition module through the MPU6050 sensor, with data being read in real time via the <inline-formula>

          <p>The system initialization program mainly includes serial port initialization, MPU6050 and I²C bus initialization, timer interrupt and external interrupt settings. Serial port initialization is mainly to define the serial port input and output mode as well as the type of data to be transmitted and to set the baud rate of serial port data transmission according to the demand. The information collected by the built-in gyroscope and accelerometer is transmitted between the MPU6050 and the single-chip microcomputer (SCM) through <inline-formula>

          <p>In addition, to ensure the normal acquisition of attitude data and motor speed, it is necessary to set the timer interrupt and external interrupt during initialization. The specific realization is to set and enable the interrupt duration and interrupt mode of the timer interrupt. In this system, since the acquisition frequency of the attitude sensor is 200 Hz, the interrupt is set to 5 ms. Besides, the interrupt triggering mode in this system is set to be triggered when the level of the corresponding channel of the encoder changes.</p>

          <p>The process of encoder speed measurement is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. Due to the high motor speed output of the self-balancing vehicle system, the method of accumulating the pulse number to measure the motor speed was selected; that is, the motor speed is obtained by calculating the number of accumulated pulse signals per unit time, and then the direction of the DC motor rotation is obtained according to the relationship between the lagging and leading of the two signals. The speed and direction of the vehicle can be obtained by further calculation. Compared with the previous method of measuring only the falling or rising edge of the encoder output signal as a pulse count, this design adopts the change count of the output signal; that is, the falling edge and the rising edge are all counted as a pulse count, which makes the precision of the speed measurement increase by four times.</p>

Similarly, when the gyroscope range is set to ±2000°/s, the FS_SEL register option is configured to 11, and the corresponding angular velocity is obtained by dividing the raw data by 16.4. After data conversion, it also needs to be fused by the KF to get the optimal estimate of the attitude angle.</p>

      <title>4. Improved kf data fusion algorithm</title>
      <p>At present, the attitude data measurement of the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle is mostly obtained by IMU modules such as the gyroscope and accelerometer. The gyroscope has a good dynamic performance, but it is easy to be affected by noise and temperature, resulting in drift error. The accelerometer has good static performance, but the motion acceleration generated during movement interferes with the output signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to use the filtering algorithm to fuse the information obtained from each of the two, thus maximizing the suppression of the influence of noise on the measurement angle.</p>

In this study, the KF algorithm was first introduced. The system state equation and observation equation are defined as follows:</p>

          <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">A comprehensive evaluation of the overall performance of the improved KF algorithm was conducted by introducing the following multi-dimensional performance metrics in addition to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) indicator:</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">a) Steady-state accuracy: The average deviation between the estimated pitch angle and the true value is measured when the self-balancing vehicle remains in a static equilibrium state.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">b) Dynamic response time: The time required for the attitude estimation to return to a stable state is recorded after the system is subjected to external disturbances.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">c) Interference resistance: The algorithm's capability to maintain stable estimation performance is evaluated after transient pulse disturbances are applied to the system.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">d) Convergence characteristics: The convergence time required to return to the equilibrium position is measured when the system starts from a large angular deviation.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">e) Real-time performance metric: The ratio of the time consumed for a single filtering computation to the total control cycle is calculated and used as an evaluation criterion.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">During the testing process, typical motion states of a self-balancing vehicle were simulated, including static equilibrium, small-amplitude oscillations (to simulate uneven road surfaces), and sudden external force disturbances. When comparisons were made between the improved algorithm and both standard KF and CF methods, the following results were observed: under transient disturbances of 5°, the overshoot was reduced by approximately 40%, with convergence to the stable region being achieved within 0.3 s.</p><p><span style="color: black; font-family: Times New Roman, serif">In tests where the self-balancing vehicle was required to recover equilibrium from a 20° large-angle deviation, stable convergence was achieved by the improved algorithm within approximately 0.5 s. Throughout the recovery process, the condition number of the covariance matrix was consistently maintained at low values, demonstrating excellent numerical stability. These characteristics confirm that the improved algorithm effectively enhances the capabilities of the self-balancing vehicle system in rapid response, disturbance rejection, and stable estimation.</p>

          <p>The key to KF design is the selection of state variables, which affects the structure of the whole state equation. In this system, the inclination angle of the vehicle body was firstly selected as one state variable, and the zero drift value of the gyroscope was selected as another state variable. The state equation is as follows:</p>

      <title>5. Pid control algorithm based on the hierarchical control strategy</title>
      <p>The control of the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle can be divided into three parts: balance, speed and direction control. To improve the control performance, stability and adjustability of the vehicle, a PID control algorithm was proposed in this study based on the hierarchical control strategy, which includes a balance control layer, a speed control layer and a direction control layer. This algorithm improves the structure of the traditional PID control algorithm and its design flow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

            <title>5.1. Balance control layer</title>
          
          <p>The balance control of the vehicle is actually to adjust its angle parameters according to the current inclination signal and angular speed signal of the vehicle through the motor drive of the wheel to keep the balance. This system adopts the method of angular velocity loop stringing into an angle loop to adjust the angle parameters of the vehicle.</p><p>The change in proportional control output is proportional to the amount of deviation from its input and responds quickly to changes in error. When the error occurs, it produces a control effect to make the error change in a smaller direction, speeding up the response of the system. Derivative control improves the dynamic performance of the system by predicting the trend of the error through the time difference of the system and then controlling it in advance, which can reduce the overshoot and control the oscillation. In the self-balancing vehicle system, due to the existence of friction and other factors, the system may have the problem of integral saturation caused by the accumulation of deviation. Therefore, this system does not introduce the integral control in the balancing control. The output value obtained by the PD controller is defined as follows:</p>

            <title>5.3. Direction control layer</title>
          
          <p>The essence of the direction control of the self-balancing vehicle is to realize the steering by controlling the difference between the rotation speeds of the two motors. In this study, a controller output update algorithm based on weighted PD was proposed. First, the proportional coefficient is multiplied with the steering angle deviation of the self-balancing vehicle. Therefore, the vehicle can be restored to the correct position when it deviates from the set rotation direction. In addition, to suppress the overshoot phenomenon during the direction adjustment of the self-balancing vehicle, the derivative coefficient is multiplied with the angle deviation of the adjacent moments of the self-balancing vehicle, as shown in Eq. (21). Then the steering control output is updated using the weighted operation, with the aim of introducing a certain degree of feedback control in the steering output and smoothing the fusion of the original output with the current steering error, which can reduce the rapid change of the control output and reduce the excessive response of the system to the steering error, as shown in Eq. (22). Finally, a limiting operation is performed on the steering control output. When the steering output deviates from the desired range, limiting its magnitude can prevent excessive steering angle from causing the vehicle to lose control or become unstable. In addition, through the limiting control, the system can respond more smoothly to the change of steering error, reduce the unnecessary oscillation phenomenon, and improve the overall stability and controllability of the system, which can make the system more robust in the case of noise, interference or other uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Based on the separate design of controllers for the balance layer, the velocity layer, and the direction layer, a unified system coupling model was established to clarify the signal transmission relationships and dynamic interaction mechanisms among the control layers. In this model, the output of the balance control layer is used as the reference input for the velocity control layer, while the steering compensation from the direction control layer is incorporated into the balance control loop. The coupling relationships between different control layers are quantitatively described through the introduction of interaction coefficients, and system stability is achieved by adjusting the weighted allocation of these coefficients. Through this modeling approach, the dynamic interaction mechanisms between the control layers can be systematically analyzed, providing a theoretical foundation for parameter optimization of the hierarchical control system.</p><p>The system state vector is defined as:</p>

</inline-formula>d t=0.01$. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, it can be seen that the proposed algorithm has an overall improvement in filtering precision compared to the other two algorithms, and the angular estimation deviation is smaller. Over this 10-s interval, the MSEs of the system after using the KF, the iterative KF algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], and the proposed algorithm are 0.5101, 0.4115, and 0.0135, respectively.</p>

          <p>The MSE effect of the system after 100 simulation experiments using the proposed algorithm and the other two algorithms is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>. It can be seen that compared with the other two algorithms, the proposed algorithm can realize continuous and stable attitude estimation, and the attitude angle estimation value of the vehicle is more precise, which improves the anti-interference of the two-wheeled balancing vehicle system. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the filtering precision under the dynamic state of the system, better tracks the angle change of the vehicle body in real time, and enhances the stability of the attitude detection system.</p>

It can be seen that, although the response time of the PD algorithm and the proposed algorithm in reaching the given angle is about 1.5 s , the adoption of the proposed algorithm greatly reduces the system's oscillation, improves the stability, and reduces the sensitivity to noise and interference.</p>

          <p>Based on the completed hardware and software design of the two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle system, comprehensive self-balancing and motion control tests were conducted. Each test item was repeated ten times to ensure statistical significance of the results. The physical prototype of the developed two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref>. Furthermore, comparative analysis between dynamic responses of control signals and vehicle posture change curves, along with experimental verification against simulation results, will be conducted in subsequent research due to the current challenges in acquiring real-time data.</p>

</inline-formula>3^{\circ}$. Excellent repeatability and stability were demonstrated by the system throughout all ten repeated tests.</p><p>End-to-end communication latency was measured through timestamp comparison. The test results showed that at a distance of 0.5 m, the average communication latency was approximately 18 ms; at 3 m, the latency increased to about 25 ms; and at the maximum distance of 8 m, the latency reached approximately 45 ms. The latency at all tested distances meets the real-time control requirements of the system. In 500 data transmission tests, the packet loss rate remained within 0.2% at 0.5 m, increased to 0.8% at 3 m, and rose to 2.4% at 8 m. The test results confirmed that within the effective communication range of 8 m, the communication latency of the Bluetooth module was maintained below the system control cycle duration, while packet loss rates were controlled within acceptable limits. These performance characteristics satisfy the real-time control requirements for the self-balancing vehicle system.</p>

      <title>7. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this study, a two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle system with Bluetooth control based on the ATmega328P microprocessor was designed. For the self-balancing vehicle attitude fusion problem, an improved KF algorithm based on iterative update of measurement was used to realize the data fusion of the gyroscope and accelerometer. Simulation results showed that the algorithm significantly improved the filtering precision of the system. For the self-balancing and motion control problem, an improved PID control algorithm was designed based on the hierarchical control strategy, which effectively addressed the susceptibility of the self-balancing vehicle system to external disturbances and poor responsiveness. After obtaining the system parameters suitable for actual operation through system debugging and analysis, the actual test showed that the Bluetooth-controlled self-balancing vehicle was able to execute the control commands issued by the mobile application while maintaining stable balance, achieving forward, backward, and steering motions with strong stability and anti-interference capability. Subsequently, the relevant methods of machine learning can be combined in the PID control algorithm to achieve real-time optimization of the PID controller parameters, thus achieving better control effects.</p>
