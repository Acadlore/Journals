      <abstract><p>The global rise in population and industrial activities has led to an increased reliance on petroleum-based fuels, resulting in significant environmental concerns, including the intensification of emissions and global warming. Concurrently, the agricultural and food processing sectors generate substantial amounts of organic waste, which, if inadequately managed, can contribute to environmental degradation. However, extensive research over recent decades has demonstrated that such organic waste can be converted into biofuels through appropriate treatment processes. In light of the growing need for sustainable energy solutions, global efforts have been increasingly focused on the exploration of renewable resources for power and electricity generation. This review aims to explore the potential role of agricultural and food wastes as feedstocks in the production of biofuels and chemical products, which can serve as substitutes for petroleum-based products. The review synthesises recent findings from multiple disciplines, including agriculture, food science, and energy, by analysing publications in leading academic databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. These studies focus on the global production of agricultural and food wastes, their energy potential, and their contributions to the energy transition, with particular emphasis on biofuels such as biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, and jet biofuel. The findings indicate that the conversion of organic waste into biofuels offers a viable solution for reducing pollution, managing waste, and promoting a circular economy. Furthermore, it presents significant opportunities for advancing sustainable energy production. The review concludes by highlighting the key challenges and knowledge gaps that must be addressed in future research to maximise the potential of these waste-to-energy technologies.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The continuously increasing need for energy and food to attend to the growing global population and the worldwide expansion of industrial activities, besides the global recommendation to avoid greenhouse emissions, urged the adoption of renewable energy sources and eco-friendly fuels. In this context, agricultural products, agricultural and food wastes (FWs), and other animal wastes such as fats, etc. appear as viable options for diversified energy production besides the recovery of minerals and chemical elements essential for industrial activities. Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas by about 19.9% and generates big amounts of organic waste, which, when treated inadequately, decomposes and contributes significantly to greenhouse emissions.</p><p>Driven by these needs, many research activities and developments were devoted to evaluating the potential of agriculture and FWs for producing biofuels and chemical products. A big variety of agricultural wastes were examined, and their physical, chemical, and thermal properties were determined to be able to choose the appropriate methods for their treatment for energy conversion and extraction of chemical products.</p><p>Sugarcane is used to produce sugar and ethanol, while the bagasse is used for electricity and heat. Bagasse is being investigated as a raw material for producing second-generation (2G) ethanol. Similar agricultural products such as corn, wheat, cassava, and sugar beets were investigated to use their wastes as raw material to be transformed into a variety of fuels and products. The processes used to convert the agricultural wastes to biofuel include thermochemical, where the biomass is converted by gasification and pyrolysis, while the biochemical processes convert the biomass by fermentation of carbohydrates.</p><p>The objective of this investigation is to demonstrate the suitability of agriculture and FWs for producing biofuels and chemical products normally obtained from petroleum. To achieve the objective, an extensive literature review was done in different related areas such as food, agriculture, fuels, and energy, with a focus on the production of biofuels and energy transition. This wide coverage, the focus on organic wastes to produce biofuels for energy transition, and the inclusion of future research trends and opportunities are what distinguish the present review from previous ones. As a contribution, the present review shows the potential of agro- and food-wastes as feedstock to produce biofuels, strengthens the circular economy, and enhances the energy transition.</p><p>The contents of the review are 1.

            <title>2.1. Generalities</title>
          
          <p>Agricultural waste refers to unwanted plant residues from crop cultivation, such as stems, leaves, and pruning, processing of agricultural products, and animal farming operations. FW is food that is discarded within the supply chain, from the farm to the consumer, due to damage, spoilage, or being uneaten.</p><p>The expansion of agricultural production increases the volume of agricultural waste and is estimated at about 998 million tons yearly. The organic part generated from municipal solid waste (MSW) is usually about 44%. The UN Environmental Program predicts the increase of MSW from 2.3 to 3.8 billion tons in the period 2023–2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>Global food and agricultural waste in 2023 reached about 1.3 billion tons, or approximately 30% of the global food production. These losses cause a financial loss estimated as \$940 billion to \$1 trillion per year, besides contributing 8–10% to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, loss of biodiversity, and inefficient use of resources. These projections alert about the need to improve the management and conversion of organic wastes to biofuels, biofertilizer, energy, and other materials of industrial use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>About 80% of a plant is considered agricultural waste, which includes stems, leaves, and branches. According to the report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], globally about 1.2 billion tons of food are wasted on the farm, which represents a loss of approximately 15.3% of food produced globally at the farming stage.</p><p>Agriculture and FWs are usually rich in sugars, starch, and other chemical compounds, which make them adequate candidates for the production of biofuels such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, and others by using biochemical and thermochemical processes.</p>

            <title>2.2. Biofuels</title>
          
          <p>Biofuels are produced from biomass, including agricultural crops, forestry residues, livestock manure, and the organic fraction of MSW, by a variety of available technological routes. The four generations of biofuels are identified according to the raw material and the production technique. Edible crops are used to produce first-generation (1G) biofuels, where bioethanol is produced from corn, sugar beet, and sugarcane, while biodiesel comes from soybeans and vegetable oils. The production of these biofuels on a big scale poses serious problems relative to food supply and security besides land use.</p><p>Research results indicated that agriculture and FWs can be used as input for producing biofuels besides resolving the problem of organic waste management. Organic wastes are used to produce 2G biofuels, where bioethanol is produced from lignocellulosic agricultural residues and biodiesel from used oil, fats, etc.</p><p>The third-generation (3G) of biofuels focuses on utilizing algae as a raw material, offering high oil yields and minimal land use. Algae-based biofuels are considered a promising route for producing sustainable biofuels, but challenges in harvesting, processing, and scaling up production persist. Fourth-generation (4G) biofuels involve genetic engineering of microorganisms and process design to optimize biofuel production. The generations 3G and 4G are still under development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>In 2023, global biofuel daily production achieved 960,000 barrels of oil equivalent, compared to daily production of 12,000 barrels in 2000. Global ethanol production in 2023 reached 116 billion liters, while global biodiesel production was around 50 billion liters. Government policies, incentives, and ambient impacts of global warming enhanced biofuel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>Biodiesel is less stable, and light, temperature, and humidity increase its deterioration. Also, it has increased emission of NO<sub>x</sub>, which generates acid rain. Drawbacks of biofuel production and use include land and water requirements and air and groundwater pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>The biomass production capacity and the high sugar and fiber content made sugarcane a potential feedstock for bioethanol, while the conversion of its bagasse to 2G ethanol helps to meet future fuel demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>To convert organic wastes to biofuels, there are a variety of available methods, such as fermentation and anaerobic digestion, and others are in the final development stage, such as dark fermentation and photo fermentation.</p>

            <title>2.3. Biofuels production methods</title>
          
          <p>Thermochemical and biochemical processes are among the methods used to convert agricultural and FW into biofuels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). Thermochemical methods include pyrolysis, gasification, and torrefaction. The pyrolysis of the biomass needs heating without oxygen to produce bio-oil, syngas, biochar, and biocoal, while gasification needs heating with a controlled oxygen supply to produce syngas. Torrefaction involves heating the biomass in an oxygen-free ambient at temperatures between 200 and 300°C to produce a solid fuel with improved energy content and enhanced combustion properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p>

            </fig>
          
          <p>Biochemical methods include anaerobic digestion, fermentation, and dark fermentation, besides other methods. In the anaerobic digestion, the organic material is converted by microorganisms, producing biogas, while fermentation converts sugars and starches into bioalcohols like ethanol. In the case of dark fermentation, the microorganisms convert organic substrates into biohydrogen. Although being a promising technology, it is still under development for hydrogen production. The process can easily be integrated with waste/wastewater treatment and has a lower cost compared to other methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>Remarks</p><p>Food quantity and quality are among the most important pillars for the survival of humans. In regular agriculture activities involving plantation, harvesting, transport, and distribution, many losses occur, and part of the production never reaches the consumer. These organic wastes, if not treated correctly, can degrade and produce greenhouse gases, which impact the environment, producing global warming and causing climatic changes, and can generate up to 10% of the global GHG emissions. Globally, the production of 1G biofuels threatens food security and interferes with water and land use. These concerns enhanced the search for other alternative eco-friendly raw materials. Organic wastes (from agriculture and food industries, residential and commercial sectors), such as lignocellulosic biomass, used oil, fats, etc., are adequate for producing 2G biofuels and chemical products, which can enhance the circular economy and create jobs. Both 3G and 4G biofuels are still under development with promising results. Challenges include more research and investments, besides adequate regulations and public policies to put them in conditions to compete in the fuel market.</p>

      <title>3. Gaseous biofuels from agriculture and food wastes</title>
      <p>Globally, huge amounts of organic waste are annually generated and must be treated adequately to avoid ambient contamination and production of GHGs. Summed up with the emission produced from fossil fuels, about 21.3 billion tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>are annually released into the atmosphere, causing global warming impacts. Hence, to restore the quality of the environment and reduce aggressions on its integrity, it is necessary to reduce fossil energy use and adequately treat organic wastes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>Agriculture waste (AGW) refers to the unused part of the plant crop and accounts for about 80% of the plant. Globally, agriculture generates a substantial amount of waste, estimated between 1.3 and 2.1 billion tons annually, which highlights their abundance and availability for conversion into valuable products for various industrial sectors. By adopting sustainable waste management practices, the agricultural sector can minimize its environmental footprint, enhance the circular economy, and help to give a correct destination to large volumes of organic matter and at the same time provide ambient sound fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p>

          <p>Biogas is generated by biodigestion of organic matter, producing mainly methane, carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> shows the possible sources of feedstock used to generate biogas.</p>

          <p>The recovery of energy and materials from these wastes avoids extraction of raw materials and natural resources and reduces emissions. Biogas generation from these wastes involves initially the decomposition of organic matter into acidic substances, which are subsequently consumed by the methanogenic bacteria to produce methane and CO₂. Biomethane is obtained from biogas by removing carbon dioxide and impurities. Biohydrogen produced from wastes is also being investigated and can be used in fuel cells, among other commercial applications.</p>
          <p>Global biogas and biomethane production reached 22 billion cubic meters in 2023, according to the European Biogas Association. This volume is equivalent to 7% of the EU’s natural gas consumption.

          <p>Biomethane is obtained from biogas by the removal of impurities like CO₂, H<sub>2</sub>S, and water vapor. Co-digestion of mixtures of different organic materials is found to enhance biogas production. Generally, anaerobic digestion of organic wastes can produce 100–200 cubic meters of biogas per ton. Gasification of biomass is another method of producing biomethane, where the resulting synthesis gas (syngas) can be processed into methane or other fuels. Also, renewable-based electricity can be used to produce hydrogen, which can be combined with carbon dioxide to produce methane. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> shows the evolution of global biomethane production in the period 2010–2023. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows a simplified line diagram of the biogas and biomethane production from agricultural waste. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> shows the co-digestion of organic animal and vegetal wastes and the biogas and biomethane applications.</p>

Potential applications of biomethane include injection into existing natural gas pipelines for domestic and commercial use, as a fuel for industrial processes, vehicle fuel, and production of green hydrogen. Methane can be upgraded by mixing it with hydrogen to produce more potent fuel, which can be used in transport and other commercial applications. In the method of producing methane from renewable energy, the generated electricity is used to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen, which is blended with methane to produce a fuel mix. This route permits storing surplus renewable-based electricity in enriched methane form and hence mitigates the intermittency of renewable energy resources and alleviates the electricity grid load. Considering the projected future production of biomethane and fields of application, its contribution to decarbonizing this fuel sector will be significant.</p>

            <title>3.3. Biohydrogen</title>
          
          <p>Currently, increasing efforts are ongoing to produce biohydrogen from organic wastes in order to reduce dependence on petroleum-based hydrogen. The developed processes of biohydrogen production include biofermentation, biophotolysis, and bioelectrochemical systems. Biofermentation is a biological process used to produce biohydrogen, where microorganisms convert organic matter into biohydrogen. This process can be achieved through dark fermentation or photo-fermentation. Dark fermentation is characterized as a fermentation process without the need for light. This process uses anaerobic bacteria and various organic substrates such as glucose, cellulose, or biomass. </p><p>Photo-fermentation is a biological process where photosynthetic microorganisms use light energy to convert organic matter into biohydrogen and carbon dioxide. This process offers a pathway for sustainable biohydrogen production, especially when using waste materials as a substrate. Combining photo-fermentation with other processes like dark fermentation can improve biohydrogen output. </p><p>Biophotolysis is the process where light is used by biological systems, specifically algae and cyanobacteria, to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. This process utilizes solar energy to drive the conversion of water into these two gases. Direct and indirect biophotolysis use sunlight to produce biohydrogen. Direct biophotolysis uses solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Indirect biophotolysis uses light to create carbohydrates from carbon dioxide, which are then fermented to produce biohydrogen. A bioelectrochemical system utilizes microorganisms to convert organic matter into biohydrogen through electrochemical reactions. </p><p>Although, in 2023, the global hydrogen production reached 97 million tons, with a small percentage being low-emissions hydrogen, the search results indicate that biohydrogen is a fast-developing market with production focused on various feedstocks and technologies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> shows the biological biohydrogen production processes.</p>

      <title>4. Liquid biofuels from organic wastes</title>
      <p>Exploring the different energy forms and utilization always accompanied the progress and development of humans over centuries. Fossil fuels and biofuels equally participated in the process but suffered changes imposed by the global political and economic interests. For a very long time, while progress in biofuels was stagnant, fossil fuels assumed the lead in transport, electricity generation, and other aspects. Global environmental changes caused by the excessive use of fossil fuels and the continuous growing need for energy and fuels urged the search for alternatives adequate in form and quantities to replace fossil sources. In recent decades, biofuels, including bioethanol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen, have shown considerable promise as alternative options for future transportation fuel needs. The primary biofuels require no processing and are used directly for cooking, generation of steam for transport, etc., while the secondary biofuels are regarded as processed biofuels and are proposed to handle the different forms of energy needs and utilization, such as transport and electricity generation, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

In this case, the carbohydrates in the bagasse are converted into fermentable sugars and then to bioethanol. Furthermore, research and developments showed that bioethanol can be produced from residues of maize, wheat, and cellulosic biomass. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> shows a simplified line diagram of the main steps of processing biomass wastes to produce bioethanol.</p>

          <p>Agriculture and food production industries generate tremendous amounts of organic waste worldwide. As was mentioned, research results have shown that these organic wastes can be used for producing a variety of biofuels using available technologies. These adopted conversion routes do not threaten food supplies or food security but solve the waste management problems.</p><p>Transesterification, a process used in the production of biodiesel, is a reaction to convert fatty and oily feedstock into biodiesel and glycerol. The transesterification using acid catalysis is used for feedstocks with high free fatty acid content, where the acid catalyst converts fatty acids into biodiesel. The enzymatic transesterification offers an environmentally friendly approach, especially when dealing with complex feedstocks or lower-quality oils. Other methods include supercritical methanol transesterification, pyrolysis, and micro-emulsion. Supercritical transesterification uses high temperature and pressure to facilitate the reaction. Pyrolysis involves heating the feedstock at high temperatures (250–350°C) to break down the fats and oils into simpler molecules, some of which can be used as biodiesel. In the case of microemulsion, a stable mixture of oil, alcohol, and a surfactant is created, allowing for easier reaction and potentially reducing the need for catalysts.</p><p>Transesterification is the most preferred technique for producing biodiesel irrespective of its sensitivity to water and free fatty acid, but the choice of feedstock can impact both efficiency and biodiesel quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_116">116</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref> shows a line diagram of the transesterification route to produce biodiesel with glycerol as a byproduct.</p>

      <title>5. Solid biofuels from organic wastes</title>
      <p>Solid biofuels have always been present in humans’ daily lives since the era in which the humans started to use fire for heating and cooking. Solid biofuels, such as firewood, woodchips, forest trash, etc., are also denominated as primary fuels, require no processing, and are used directly for the generation of heat and electricity. Organic wastes from crops and food processing and leftovers usually have a big volume, which makes them less attractive for use due to transport, handling, and storage issues. The densification of these residues facilitates their commercialization and acceptance for energy use.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">To achieve these objectives, two methods are usually used, namely torrefaction and pelletizing. Torrefaction is the heating of biomass at 200–300°C without oxygen to increase its energy density and remove moisture and volatile organic compounds while preserving the carbon content. Upgrading biomass by torrefaction reduces the volume and increases the energy density of biomass and residues besides facilitating their transport and storage and improving their acceptance by the users. Van der Stelt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_180">180</xref>], Nhuchhen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_181">181</xref>], Poudel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_182">182</xref>], and Saravanan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] showed that the torrefaction temperature increases the higher heating value. The authors also investigated the associated technology, domestic and industrial applications, and economic potential of the torrefied biomass and FW. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_17">Figure 17</xref> shows a simplified line diagram of the torrefaction process.</p>

      <title>6. Biorefinery and biofuels</title>
      <p>In biorefineries, by using processes such as thermochemical and biochemical for treating organic material and agricultural and FWs, bioproducts such as biofuels, chemical products, electricity, and heat can be obtained. Through biorefinery, the biomass and the generated wastes are valorized, providing additional gains such as stimulating circular economy, reducing emissions, preserving raw materials, and contributing to ambient sanitation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_18">Figure 18</xref> shows the integrated utilization of the agriculture oil crop to produce biodiesel and 2G biofuels. As can be observed from the flow chart, the raw material is utilized for producing different products, and the residues generated from the different processes are used as feedstock for other processes to produce different products, ending finally with minimal inert rejects.</p>

          <p>To break off the global warming, it is necessary to change the paradigm related to the generation and consumption of energy. Strategies for mitigation of emissions of GHGs must be based on sustainable energy transition. In this respect, the valorization and the optimized utilization of natural resources, minimizing losses and valorizing and reutilizing wastes, are essential for the production of clean energy. The review shows that the agriculture and food sectors and the associated industries are big producers of organic wastes whose composition is rich in both energy and material.</p><p>Dedicated research on using organic wastes to produce biofuels and reduce pressure on food crops, water, and land use resulted in a big expansion of the production of 2G biofuels. Research is continued on algae to produce the third and fourth generations of biofuels, which do not interfere in any aspect with food supply, besides being environmentally friendly.</p><p>Research and development continue on using organic wastes for gaseous fuel production via fermentation and other methods to produce biogas, biohydrogen, and biomethane for transport and domestic and commercial applications, while the digested material can be used as a fertilizer. Torrefaction, pelletizing, and briquetting of organic wastes convert them into more energy-dense, coal-like solid fuel, which can enhance their domestic and commercial acceptance for heating and electricity generation.</p><p>In summary, this review shows that biofuels will not only impel the energy industry towards a sustainable global energy transition, reducing emissions and conserving natural resources, but also will provide valuable opportunities to reuse organic wastes to produce biofuels and bioproducts via research and technological developments.</p>

            <title>7.2. Future research opportunities</title>
          
          <p>Biohydrogen production from organic wastes faces challenges such as production efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental concerns. Research gaps include improving fermentation processes, developing efficient pretreatment methods for feedstocks, and enhancing the overall sustainability of the biohydrogen production cycle. Funding, financial incentives, adequate regulations, and public policies are required.</p><p>Bioethanol production from organic wastes is advancing. New research and developments include enhancing ethanol yields, reducing byproduct generation, and utilizing novel feedstocks. Funding, international interactions and cooperation, regulations, and adequate public policies are essential.</p><p>Glycerol from the biodiesel industry accounts for about 10% of the production. Considering the increasing tendencies of biodiesel production, new possible applications to valorize glycerol are needed. Among the possible applications is its use to produce bioethanol and biohydrogen; both are highlighted as viable solutions. Developments of environmentally friendly methods, pilot production plants, and technical and economic assessments, besides financial incentives and adequate regulations and public policies, are required.</p><p>In 2024, SAF accounted for approximately 0.3% to 0.6% of global jet fuel, indicating the need for more production of jet biofuel to achieve zero emissions in the aviation sector by 2050. Possible alternative routes such as alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and biomass-to-liquid (BTL) should be investigated besides other alternatives. Research and development are ongoing on a global level to produce jet biofuels from organic wastes safe enough for aviation. The search for suitable feedstock, enhancing competitiveness of jet biofuels, and attending to security and emissions challenges are needed for worldwide production. There is a need for coordinated efforts between industrial developments, research, and the aviation sector to produce jet biofuel with enough quantity and quality to help reduce the environmental impacts of the aviation sector.</p><p>Investigations are ongoing on the use of the biorefinery for organic wastes to extract chemical elements in parallel to biofuels production. This concept can help in the management of organic wastes, besides other benefits such as enhancing the circular economy, strengthening multifocal beneficiation of agricultural wastes, and reducing organic wastes sent to landfills.</p>
