      <abstract><p>Breast tumors have become one of the most frequent illnesses among women, with 287,850 new cases projected to be discovered in 2022. Of those, 43,250 women passed away from this malignancy. The mortality rate for cancer might be decreased through early detection. Despite this, employing mammography photographs to manually identify this kind of cancer is a challenging process that always demands an expert. In the literature, a number of AI-based (Artificial Intelligence) strategies have been proposed. However, they still deal with issues including irrelevant feature extraction, inadequate training models, and similarities between cancerous and non-cancerous areas. In order to identify breast cancer, this research suggested an SMO-MAFNet-Hybrid Alexnet model. The images in this study were first preprocessed to get rid of noise. After that, the multi-attention fusion network (MAFNet) is used to extract features. The Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) method is utilized in this work to optimize the learning rate in MAFNet. Following feature extraction, classification is done using the AlexNet model. In this work, hybrid optimization, namely Ant Colony Optimization-Reptile Search Algorithm (ACO-RSA), is applied to fine-tune the hyperparameters in AlexNet classification. The suggested method was tested using the CBIS-DDSM (Curated breast imaging subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography) dataset and demonstrated an accuracy of 98%, outperforming previous models.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Large connected gadgets link to the Internet of Things (IoT), an interactive paradigm that is constantly increasing and enabling communication between people and things in our current digital environment. IoT includes all medical devices that gather patient health information, including smartphones, smartwatches, wearable wristbands, integrated surgical instruments, and other flexible health monitoring gadgets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. This technology is used in both homes and hospitals to remotely monitor patients, facilitating the early diagnosis and treatment of serious illnesses and medical problems. Remote patient monitoring in hospital settings has the potential to drastically lower needless doctor visits, hospital stays, readmissions, and total healthcare expenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Despite the difficulties and barriers encountered in the past, IoT technologies have revolutionized the world of medical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. These IoT devices have the potential to provide large amounts of biomedical data, which may be very helpful in the creation of systems that automatically gather medical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. As IoT devices are connected, big data, together with cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) technology, plays a crucial role in improving current healthcare systems' diagnosis, treatment, and decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>The Internet of Everything (IoE), which incorporates symptomatic treatments and monitoring along with tracking of patients, has attracted research attention as a result of IoT in biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks breast tumors as the most common worldwide reason for death in women. Early identification of breast tumors in women is the greatest approach to saving lives and reducing healthcare expenditures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. In general, cancers are classified as either benign or malignant. Benign tumors don't pose a life-threatening hazard, but they may make women more likely to develop breast cancer. On the other hand, malignant tumors are cancerous and need to be treated right away. According to research on breast cancer screening, 20% of women had malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Breast tumors may be identified over an extended duration of time by utilizing a number of methods, including X-rays, ultrasound, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Breast cancer in its early stages may be assessed by screening, which finds the disease when small breast symptoms appear. Mammography, clinical breast exams, and other methods are additional methods for breast screening. In mammography, doctors utilize brief-intensity X-rays to scan the breasts for anomalies. There are two other imaging techniques to check for breast cancer issues: ultrasound and MRI scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. A "one-size-fits-all" screening strategy runs the risk of underdiagnosing breast tumors, particularly in women with dense breasts. Breast density, which is the ratio of fibroglandular tissue to fatty tissue in the breast, affects the sensitivity of mammography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Mammography has established as the most accurate approach for identifying breast tumors because of its capacity and affordability to meet medical needs. The major technique used by doctors to make diagnoses is mammography analysis, although this approach is subject to bias and physician fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>The mammography technique has a poor rate in detecting breast tumors, which is unfortunate. Depending on the type of tumors, the general size of the female breasts, and the elder age of the victim, it may give false-negative results of 5% to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. As a result, mammography uses low-dose radiography, which enables viewing of the internal breast tissue. Breast cancer is detected using a variety of signal processing techniques, such as curvelet transform, microwave imaging, and ultrasound imaging. The traditional approach for categorizing medical infections, such as skin blemishes, breast lumps, and brain tumors, is based on pattern recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. The mammography characteristics for breast cancer are manually retrieved, and they are then sent inside an ML classifier for categorization. Obtaining a proper classification, however, remains challenging because of many imaging difficulties and alterations in tumor regions. As a result, deep learning (DL) has played a major part in the past ten years in the detection and classification of medical infections, particularly for breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>Current techniques for identifying breast cancer from mammography pictures mostly depend on deep learning architectures or classic machine learning algorithms. Although these techniques have showed promise, they frequently fail to capture the complex patterns and nuanced characteristics typical of breast cancer in its early stages. Additionally, they can be less effective in clinical situations due to noise and fluctuations in image quality.</p><p>By utilizing cutting-edge approaches in deep learning and attention mechanisms, the suggested method, "Detection of Breast Cancer in Mammogram Images using Multi-Attention Feature Extraction with Hybrid RSA-based AlexNet," seeks to overcome these drawbacks. The major contributions in this paper are:</p><p><p>Preprocessing the mammography images to eliminate noise is a vital initial step in our methodology.</p><p>In order to extract pertinent characteristics from the images, this paper uses the MAFNet.

      <p>In their study, Pati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] created a deep transfer learning (DTL) model-based autonomous system for identifying breast cancer. For their investigation, they used mammography pictures from the publicly available online archive the cancer imaging archive (TCIA). Preprocessing was done on the data before it was entered into the model. In order to improve predictive accuracy (ACC), the study combined well-known deep learning (DL) techniques, such as support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with transfer learning (TL) methods, specifically by utilizing models like Inception V3, ResNet50, VGG16, AlexNet, and VGG19. The research extensively used simulations to test the viability of their suggested strategy, evaluating several performance metrics and network indicators. Notably, the large collection of mammography pictures was divided into benign and malignant categories. With percentages of 97.99%, 99.51%, 98.43%, 80.08%, and 98.97%, respectively, for precision (PR), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy, the findings outperformed earlier mammography-based studies. The report also described the use of fog computing technology, which improves system performance while reducing the load on core servers and upholds strict criteria for patient privacy and data security.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Specifically, for IoT applications, Rajeswari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] set out to construct an exponential honey badger optimization-based deep convolutional neural network (EHBO-based DCNN) with a major emphasis on early breast cancer (BC) diagnosis. They cleverly combined the Honey badger optimisation (HBO) strategy with the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) method to produce the EHBO approach, which they used to achieve their goal. The EHBO framework was painstakingly created to enable the smooth transfer of medical data collected through IoT to a central base station (BS) and at the same time identify important cluster heads to discover instances of BC. The study then used data augmentation methods, texture analysis, and the extraction of statistical features. The implementation of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for BC classification was the last phase. With test scores of 0.9029, 0.9051, and 0.8971, respectively, the algorithm demonstrated remarkable performance, attaining impressive levels of specificity, sensitivity, and total accuracy. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP), deep learning (DL), support vector machine (SVM), and ensemble-based classifier were all outperformed by this suggested approach, with margins of 7.23%, 6.62%, 5.39%, and 3.45%, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Kwak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] used DL methods for medical image identification in their study to dive into the field of breast cancer detection. Their in-depth investigation included a variety of medical imaging modalities, including histology, ultrasonography, and X-ray (Mammography) pictures. This thorough investigation's main goals were to improve breast cancer detection precision and give accurate identification of afflicted anatomical areas. The main objective was to improve the detecting process's overall accuracy. A wide range of image classification techniques were investigated by the researchers, including VGGNet19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet v2. They also explored the world of picture segmentation technologies, analyzing choices including UNet, ResUNet++, and DeepLab v3. Furthermore, the research dug into the evaluation of numerous loss functions, including binary cross-entropy, dice loss, and Tversky loss, as ways to improve the analysis. A variety of data augmentation methods were carefully used to expand the dataset and strengthen the validity of their conclusions.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Park et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] designed to evaluate the capability of an ML system in predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis by incorporating preoperative contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) data from both the main tumour and ALN. The study included 266 breast cancer patients who received pretreatment CECT scans of their chest cavities at a single medical facility. The study included a variety of ML methods, such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forests, and neural networks (NN). The researchers included statistical analysis with recursive feature elimination (RFE) as part of the ML process. With an ACC of 0.74 and an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.12, the NN with RFE model was shown to be the most successful ML model for predicting ALN metastases in breast cancer. The contrast between a model without these properties and a NN with RFE model adding ALN characteristics from CECT was particularly remarkable. The former consistently outperformed the latter across all evaluation criteria, highlighting the significant benefit of integrating ALN features in the model. By using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images from both the original tumour and axillary lymph nodes, this research illustrates how well ML methods predict ALN metastasis. These results demonstrate ML's outstanding capability to distinguish between benign and malignant ALNs, offering helpful information for therapeutic decision-making in the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p style="text-align: justify">An IoT-based automated method for diagnosing breast cancer was created by Gao and Rezaeipanah [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. When a suspect patient is examined using IoT-enabled medical equipment, this cutting-edge device quickly communicates medical pictures to a data warehouse. The ability to precisely analyze these medical pictures by radiologists was enabled by the researchers' use of four pre-trained CNN models, notably InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG 19, and ResNet 152. To combine these models for greater accuracy, they used an ensemble classifier. Additionally, algorithms were used to offer accurate predictions in three separate categories: pneumonia patients, healthy people, and women with breast tumors. The research used two separate datasets, each of which had CT-scan and X-RAY pictures. Notably, the InceptionResNetV2 architecture attained a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.36% for CT-scan pictures whereas the Inception V3 model showed an exceptional accuracy rate of 96.94% for X-RAY images. These discoveries have the potential to improve patient care by enabling healthcare workers to identify breast tumors early on and so minimizing the need for frequent doctor visits, which would lessen the burden on healthcare facilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The combination of several CNNs and meta-learning algorithms was researched by Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] to create a trustworthy and efficient breast cancer classification model. A sizable database of breast ultrasound images (BUSI), which included a range of breast abnormalities, was used in the investigation. The major objective was to identify these tumors' malignant or benign status, an essential step in the early detection and quick treatment of breast cancer. The complicated and varied composition of the images presented a challenge to current ML and DL techniques. To completely resolve this issue, the research team proposed a novel model integrating cutting-edge techniques such as meta-learning ensemble approach, transfer learning, and data augmentation. The model's use of meta-learning to accelerate learning and provide speedy adaptation to new datasets was its primary strength. Utilizing pre-trained models like Inception, ResNet50, and DenseNet 121 further helped the model's capacity to extract features. The dataset was augmented with artificially created training images to increase its size and diversity. Notably, the model improved classification accuracy (ACC) by combining the outcomes of several CNNs utilizing meta ensemble learning techniques. As part of the research methodology, the BUSI dataset was preprocessed, and different CNNs with various architectures and trained models were trained and assessed. After employing a meta-learning technique to refine the learning process, ensemble learning was used to merge many CNN outputs. The study's results provided significant new information about the proposed model in addition to confirming its correctness and effectiveness. The research team conducted a thorough investigation, compared their model's F1 score, ACC, recall (RC), and precision-recall (PR) measurements with cutting-edge methods employed in current systems.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thirumalaisamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] developed a novel approach to aid radiologists in detecting breast cancer more rapidly. This approach includes synthesized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an enhanced optimization strategy, and transfer learning. A crucial part of this technique was modifying the ant colony optimization (ACO) method to fit the limitations of opposition-based learning (OBL). The researchers used the enhanced ant colony optimization (EACO) technique to tune the hyperparameters of the CNN architecture. The EACO-ResNet101 model was developed inside this unique framework by combining the ResNet101 CNN architecture with the EACO algorithm. Experiments were conducted using mammographic datasets from MIAS and DDSM (CBIS-DDSM) to evaluate the efficacy of this method. The suggested model performed better, according to the CBIS-DDSM dataset findings, which had ACC rates of 98.63%, sensitivity rates of 98.76%, and specificity rates of 98.89%. The model performed quite well on the MIAS dataset as well, with a classification ACC of 99.15%, a sensitivity of 97.86%, and a specificity of 98.88%. These findings unequivocally show that, as compared to older techniques, the EACO-ResNet101 model performs better in breast cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>After receiving the dataset, several photos that were just artifacts labeled as malignant masses or blank images were discovered. ACC might suffer as a result of these photographs. 17 photos were therefore manually eliminated. 327 malignant mass mammograms remained in the photos after the photographs had been removed, whereas the number of mammogram images in the other categories remained steady. As a consequence, 1442 photos in a dataset with four distinct classifications are produced. Examples of four classes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, along with information on their traits and artifacts.</p>

            <title>3.2. Preprocessing</title>
          
          <p>Before inserting the pictures inside a neural network for analysis, image pre-processing thought to be the most crucial operation to attain a reasonable level of ACC and shorten the computing time of a model. It is complicated to an artificial neural network technique in order to categorize mammograms without first using pre-processing methods. As a result, picture pre-processing is done first. The studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] outlined many pre-processing methods that may be used without degrading the quality of the original picture. Two further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] improved the contrast of mammography using tried-and-true techniques.</p><p style="text-align: justify">In this part, it is explained how mammography quality and quantity might be improved. This covers picture improvement, background removal, and artifact removal. The primary processes, related sub-processes of picture pre-processing phase are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. Artefact removal, remove line, picture enhancement, and testing are the primary procedures.</p>

          <p>Block (A): A variety of approaches are used to remove any anomalies seen in original mammograms as: binary masking of the image, morphological opening (second process), and largest contour identification that produce artefact at ease mammograms; In block (B) lines are connected with the female breast portion of the mammograms eliminated via different techniques: in Range Operation(the early process) following Gabor filter, Morphological opening, which is the third process and then Invert mask manipulation; (C) image enhancement through further Gamma correction following, 1<sup>st</sup> then 2<sup>nd</sup> contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization and Green Fire Software with a Blue Filter, which is ImageJ; subsequently in the block (D) the ACC of modified pictures has been examined by image statistical evaluation.</p><p style="text-align: justify">To get a more accurate result, artifacts from the mammograms are first eliminated, then certain techniques (binary masking of images, followed by process of morphological opening process, and biggest contour identification, the final phase) are used. Second, the vertical line connected to the breast region is removed using the "remove line" step. In this study, techniques including Range operation, Gabor filter morphological operation subsequently inverse masking methods were applied. The subprocesses of opening and dilatation are both part of the morphological operation. Thirdly, image enhancement is used to boost the contrast and luminosity of the initial pictures in order to improve the visibility of the malignant condition. Gamma correction, which is depicted in the block image [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], CLAHE (1st process) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], CLAHE (2nd process), and the green-coloured fire blue ImageJ filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] are the subprocesses of this stage2. An increase in visibility may be seen after using CLAHE. Then, CLAHE is used once again to boost the contrast. In other words, the method involves applying CLAHE twice. CLAHE should not be used a third time since doing so might distort the contrast level and impair the ability to see fine details in mammograms. Finally, in the verification step, evaluation methods are performed to the processed pictures to analyze the outcomes, including PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio), MSE (mean square error), RMSE (root mean squared error), SSIM (structural similarity index) and histogram analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> depicts the entire pre-processing pipeline, with the result of each stage serving as the input for the next stage.</p>

              <p>As a feature extractor, multi-attention fusion CNN (MAFNet) technique is used in this research. Four convolution models are present in the centre of MAFNet's<span style="font-family: Times, serif">  convolutio<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">n layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], while three convolution frameworks are found throughout all the modules. And the distribution of the convolution module follows a symmetrical pattern similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. Finally, there are 26 convolution modules in the FC layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. Following that, the pictures are supplied as input, and the first 1 × <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">1 convolutional method is carried out. 4 convolution algorithms are subsequently passed for four times again. The contextual transformer (CoT) block of the primary ResNet (Residual Network) convolution structures replaces 3 × <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">3 convolutional operation. The characteristics recovered are next provided as feed to FC levels (layers), which carry out the function of "classification" in neural network approach, following the early convolution, pooling, and excitation procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> depicts the MAFNet model's architecture.

              <p>Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) plays an essential role in optimizing the learning rate (lr), as specified in Eq. (3). The SMO technique is a metaheuristic approach that was inspired by the social behavior of spider monkeys. This novel approach to problem solving draws on the collective behaviors of spider monkeys, integrating features of fission and swarm intelligence, as mentioned in the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. Spider monkeys reside in communities between 40 and 50. A leader divides the responsibility of finding food in a community. Typically, a spider monkey swarm consists of 40 to 50 individuals, and the leader divides out the responsibility of finding food within an area. The worldwide leader of the swarm in the case of a food scarcity is always a leading female, which results in changeable smaller groupings. Based on the food supply in a particular area, the group size is determined. The spider monkey's size is closely correlated with the amount of food available. The required requirements are satisfied by the SMO-based approach of swarm intelligence (SI).</p><p style="text-align: justify">Smaller groups are formed to share the spider monkeys' foraging tasks. Self-organization: The group size is used to determine the food availability requirement. Intelligent foraging activity results in an intelligent choice. Swarm is used to start the food hunt. The distance between persons serving as food sources is computed. The distances between the members of the food groups change the locations for choosing. It is calculated how far apart individual is from their food supply.</p>

              <p>For its six iterative collaborative stages, the SMO approach relies on trial and error: global leader decision phase, learning phase, local leader learning phase, local leader decision phase, global leader and local leader phase. ACO algorithms, inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, excel in exploring complex search spaces and identifying optimal solutions through iterative interactions. The collaborative framework of hybrid ACO-RSA enhances the robustness and generalizability of AlexNet by mitigating the risk of model bias and overfitting. By leveraging diverse optimization strategies, the model can effectively adapt to variations in mammogram images and generalize its diagnostic capabilities across diverse patient populations and imaging conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify">In summary, the selection of SMO for MAFNet and the integration of a hybrid ACO-RSA approach with AlexNet reflect a strategic fusion of bio-inspired optimization techniques tailored to the unique requirements of breast cancer detection in mammogram images. These algorithmic choices contribute to the development of robust, efficient, and clinically relevant detection frameworks, ultimately advancing the field of medical image analysis and improving patient outcomes in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

              <p>Global Leader Decision (GLD) Phase</p><p style="text-align: justify">If the position is not changed for a global leader up to the GLL, according to the preferences of the global leader, the populace is split into smaller sections. After receiving a maximum number of groups (MG), the splitting procedure begins. Each time, a local authority figure is chosen for recently established group. The greatest number of permissible sets is formed, and the global leader remains in their position until the pre-fixed permitted limit has been attained. At that point, the global leader seeks to combine all permitted groups into an individual group. The largest number of permissible chains is formed, and the global leader holds on to that position until the pre-fixed maximum has been reached. At that point, the global leader seeks to combine all permitted chains to unite. The following are the SMO evaluating control specifications:</p><p style="text-align: justify">Rate of perturbation (pr);</p><p style="text-align: justify">Maximum number of groups (MG);</p><p style="text-align: justify">Global Leader Limit;</p><p style="text-align: justify">Rate of Local Leader Limit.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Gaussian Mutation</p><p style="text-align: justify">In difficult iterative optimization situations, the SMO approach gets stymied in a local optimum. The algorithm solution value does not vary throughout iteration. This strategy leaves the location of the local optimum and includes stochastic perturbation and the Gaussian mutation before continuing on executing the creed in order to enhance the algorithm probability and algorithm deficiency. Eq. (9) displays the Gaussian mutation.</p>

The network's architecture has 5 convolution layers, which are followed by an average of 3 pooling layers, making it deeper than ordinary CNN.

              <p>This research is built on the suggested AlexNet CNN framework, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>. The first picture input layer serves as a preprocessing step for the study project. The spatial dimensions of incoming frames are down-sampled from 640 × 480 to 227 × 227, thereby lowering the processing requirements of the DL architecture. The architecture is made up of five convolutional (CONV) layers, three pooling (POOL) layers, and a rectified linear unit (RELU) after each. A total of 96 kernels with size of 11 × 11 by 3 are used in the first convolutional layer. The second convolutional layer then makes use of 256 kernels that are 5 × 5 in size. 384 kernels with 3 × 3 dimensions are selected for the third, fourth, and fifth layers. An activation map is produced for each convolutional layer. A 2 × 2 stride is used to merge the activation maps (feature maps) from the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers with the 3 × 3 pooling layers. The framework is divided into eight levels, each containing 4096 nodes. These layers are essential for building flexible feature maps that make feature extraction easier. Then, the fully connected layers (FC) get the activation maps, and Soft-max activation is used to generate classification probabilities, which are then used in the final classification step.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Convolution Network Layer</p><p style="text-align: justify">The layer that creates the activation maps that is exposed to classification layers in the DL phenomenon of neural networks is the most important layer. It contains kernel which moves across the source frame (input) to produce the activation map as the output. Everywhere the input, matrix multiplication was done, and the result was then integrated. Eq. (11)'s output activation map is described as:</p>

              <p>Maximum Pooling Layer</p><p style="text-align: justify">In order to decrease the relative dimension of every frame and the computational cost of the recommended DL structure, a layer is that is added to the suggested framework (pooling layer) despite the primary and next convolution layers and then again following the fifth convolution layer. The pooling method typically averages each slice of the picture or simply selects the highest value. The suggested method employs pooling, which produces superior results on this configuration, by utilizing the maximum value against each slice. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> shows how to activate the output for down-sampling the pictures while using the maximum pooling layer.</p>

For classification of multiclass, the output of deep convolutional network layer (DCNN) is supplied to layer <italic>Softmax</italic>, which aids in calculating classification probabilities, after five sets of convolutional network layer processing. The last classification layer utilizes these probabilities in order to divide each frame into crowd/out-field, close-up, medium and long perspectives.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Dropout Layer</p><p style="text-align: justify">To avoid excessive fitting of the input information by raising the number of iterations by a ratio of two, keeping the neurons densely packed the dropout layer is implemented in the initial pair of layers that are completely connected once the number of iterations twice in the network. It employs neural networks to average models, and it is a particularly effective technique of managing training data. The generated activation map is down sampled to a single frame (pixel) for every map by the processing of maximum pooling layers, convolutional layer kernel sizes, and their skipping factors. The output of the uppermost layers is further related to a 1D feature vector through a layer that is completely connected. In order to extract higher-level characteristics from the training data, the top layer must always be properly connected to the output unit for the class label. This method, a normalization approach on completely linked layers prior to and subsequent dropout is illustrated.</p>

              <p>Ant colony optimization (ACO) is an organically designed MA which imitates the ant's foraging behavior. Since ACO permits parallel processing without creating a process dependence and provides feedback on ant behavior in the search space, the model is more rational than previous MAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. Ants can determine the quickest path between their colony and a food source; therefore, they are not blind while searching for food. Ants drop down a chemical substance known as pheromones along their trails as they go. The pheromone acts as a conduit to facilitate interaction amongst ants and indicates the shortest approach to their food source of food. Ants find food on detecting the pheromones left behind by other ants who have already travelled a certain route, which enhances the likelihood that more ants will follow in their footsteps. ACO bases its probabilistic judgments on the heuristic data and pheromone trail. As they go along a trail, the ants adjust the pheromone amount at any point. A feature has a greater chance of becoming a component of the shortest route the more ants pass over it and the more pheromones are deposited there as a consequence. The most ants will go down the route with the greatest concentration of pheromones, and it will also be the shortest way. Ants have distributed arbitrarily among a group of features corresponding to a predetermined greatest number of several generations $T<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>L B_j$ limits.</p><p>RSA may be defined in terms of two principles: exploration and exploitation, much as the other nature-inspired MAs. The crocodile's ability to makeover while surrounding its prey helps to explain these concepts. To benefit from crocodiles' natural behavior, RSA's total iterations are split into four phases. RSA completes the investigation in the first two phases using an encircling habit that includes high and belly walking motions. Crocodiles start to circle the area to explore it, enabling a more thorough search of the solution space. Eq. (21) may be used to quantitatively represent this behavior as follows:</p>

          <p>A Dell PowerEdge T430 computer with 2 GB of RAM is utilized for training the experiments. The computer has a graphics processing unit (GPU) and is powered by an Intel Xeon 2 processor with eight cores running at 2.4 GHz. It also has 32 GB of DDR4 RAM. The computing resources required to carry out the tests and assess the effectiveness of the suggested strategy are provided by these specifications. the size of the dataset, and the desired level of convergence. In the context of training models on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, the number of epochs typically ranges from 70, although this may better on experimentation and validation performance. The batch size refers to the 250 of training examples utilized in each iteration of the training process. Larger batch sizes can expedite the training process by leveraging parallel processing capabilities, while smaller batch sizes may offer more stability and generalizability.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Mammogram pictures are categorized into four groups in this research utilizing the CBIS-DDSM dataset and the proposed approach. Noise is removed in this case using an image pre-processing approach. To further enhance the quality of the unprocessed mammography, backdrop elimination and methods for enhancing images were employed. The feature of extraction employs the MAFNet model. The learning rate indicated in MAFNet is optimized using the SMO approach. Following feature extraction, feature categorization is carried out by using the AlexNet model. In this work, hybrid optimization in the form of ACO-RSA is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters in feature classification based on AlexNet. As a consequence, the suggested system's performance metrics evaluation revealed that it had a 98% accuracy rate, which is a superior outcome than other current models. Future image fusion approaches will integrate the tumor segmentation phase, and segmentation taken into consideration for the process feature extraction. The computational time issue will be addressed by an improved feature fusion method.</p>
