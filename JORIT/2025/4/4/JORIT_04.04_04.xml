      <abstract><p>This study examines the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and internal control (IC) on corporate reputation (CR) in the context of digital transformation (DT), which serves as a moderating variable. Furthermore, a sample of 324 individuals was selected from the research community of accountants, auditors, and other specialists working in the Iraqi environment, and data were collected using a list of questionnaires analyzed based on a Likert scale. The stability and reliability of the scale were verified using Cronbach’s alpha and the split-half method according to Spearman-Brown’s value, and several statistical tests were used to verify data distribution and potential bias. In addition, regression models were designed to test four main hypotheses. The results showed a positive impact of both corporate social responsibility and internal control on corporate reputation. Digital transformation technologies (DTT) strengthens the relationship between CSR, IC, and CR. This study offers academic value as it empirically analyzes the impact of those variables in the light of DT as a moderating variable. It also provides management, regulators, and stakeholders with possible strategies in accordance with the business environment, and provides policy implications for promoting institutional development and ESG requirements.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an evolving business model where a firm makes specific efforts to run in a way that serves society and the environment. Carroll proposed a hierarchical CSR concept comprising dimensions: economic, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities. Legal responsibility indicates the required standard that firms must uphold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Carroll, 1991</xref>). In spite of stakeholders’ expectations having risen in recent decades, several practices ones considered ethical responsibilities have become legal obligations. For example, hiring female employees and prohibiting workplace discrimination which were moral issues in many countries, are now legally mandated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>). This shift reflects growing stakeholder emphasis on CSR as a result of globalization on the increasing significance of stability in business operations. CSR has thus evolved from a reactive measure to a proactive managerial approach that enhances a company’s public image and long-term competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Adib et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To effectively implement CSR strategies, many companies today rely on digital transformation technologies (DTT) tools that enable the integration of technology into social and environmental initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Liu &amp;amp; Jung, 2021</xref>). For example, in response to pressure from environmental groups to source palm oil responsibly, Unilever developed an AI-based monitoring system that tracks palm oil using satellite and GPS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). This is an example of social responsibility implemented through DTT in supply chain management, including the use of educational materials via DTT. In short, several companies across various industries use digital technology to promote CSR, making these efforts more efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Song et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, CSR functions as a management mechanism to build trust among investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and governments. However, due to cultural factors and economic development, CSR levels in emerging countries are lower than those in developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Simultaneously, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015, highlights the need to pursue global sustainable development through DTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdelkarim, 2025</xref>). As the mining economy expands, the DT of businesses has emerged as an important factor affecting the global economy. This trend has particularly affected production companies, which are under considerable pressure to use new techniques compared to the service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Butt, 2020</xref>). In Iraq, where the production industry is an important component of the real economy, the government has promoted DTT in businesses in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Guo &amp;amp; Xu, 2021</xref>). The Iraqi government in its latest work report, has nominated "Digital Economy" as a central topic and institutionalized digital changes as a national strategy for the formal development of businesses, making it an important component to achieve high-quality business development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Jameel et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Khalaf &amp;amp; Hussein, 2024</xref>).</p><p>In order to achieve a permanent competitive advantage and promote business value, companies are encouraged, by the government, to participate actively in CSR and DT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Warner &amp;amp; Wäger, 2019</xref>). Given their limited resources, however, they should make important decisions on optimal allocation and use of these resources in order to meet social and environmental responsibilities. It is important to develop and implement strategies that effectively utilize DT. To accomplish this matter, it is necessary to install and use an effective approach of IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Saleh et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Internal control (IC) is considered a comprehensive organizational approach that oversees various activities to achieve a firm’s objectives via the effective implementation of strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). An officiant IC enables companies to improve management compliance and operational level, and reduce the risks they face during production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Song et al., 2025</xref>). For instance, by providing and reporting reliable information, IC limits risks in terms of information asymmetry and the cost of debt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Carroll, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Zhang &amp;amp; Zhao, 2023</xref>). In the case of emerging countries, in 2011, the Financial Supervision Law was issued in Iraq, which aims to organize and develop financial oversight mechanisms for government institutions and the public sector, and includes a set of laws and regulations aimed at fighting corruption and enhancing transparency and accountability in the management of public funds. However, such types of corruption continue to occur as inadequate IC results in financial failure and expelling investment opportunities, and strengthening trust between citizens and the government.</p><p>In summary, CSR is a critical requirement for firms to ensure that their operations comply with public expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Asogwa et al., 2020</xref>). Simultaneously, DT has emerged as an important strategy for achieving and maintaining a competitive edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). A strong ICS that effectively monitors all the company's activities can strengthen the success of both DTT and corporate CSR. However, today's literature has not discovered how to detect complex interactions between CSR, DTT, IC, and corporate reputation (CR). As a result, the current study develops new models based on stakeholder, resource-based principle, and agent theory, to examine how that interaction affects the firm value between CSR and DTT, as well as IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.1. Agency theory, stakeholder theory, allocated resources theory</title>
          
          <p>The study framework and hypotheses will be established based on agency theory, stakeholder theory, and resource-based theory. The three theories’ details are explained below.</p><p>Agency Theory: In 1932, this theory was first founded by Pearl and Mein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Later, both Jensen and Meckling in 1976 and 1979 developed an increased awareness of the problem of agency, showing the relationship between superiors and subordinates, where ownership and management were separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Jensen &amp;amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Jensen &amp;amp; Meckling, 1979</xref>). Therefore, many researchers explained that agency problems can arise due to the mismatch between owners and managers. Thus, the conflict of interests might lead managers to take actions and opportunistic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Saleh et al., 2025</xref>). From this standpoint, DT can contribute to the accurate information transfer, increase the transparency of that information, and mitigate the level of information conflict, which leads to alleviating the problem of agency among managers and owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Gouvea et al., 2022</xref>). It also enables IC to improve management risks and provide quality financial reports and contribute to improving the value of the company and thus reducing conflicts between owners and agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">Wu &amp;amp; Zeng, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Stakeholder Theory: Ansoff is the first person who propose the concept of stakeholder. He believed that the overarching consideration for the company lies in meeting the needs of all stakeholders. Later, redefined the concept of theory as groups or individuals who might be affected by what that institution achieves, and classified them into two categories: internally, such as employees, and externally such as suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Freeman &amp;amp; McVea, 2005</xref>). Stakeholder theory focuses on the flexibility that characterizes the objectives of the institution, which helps it keep pace with the transition from a traditional process that focuses only on economic profits. This is consistent with CSR requirements in terms of balancing environmental and stakeholder interests to maximize earnings. Therefore, it can be considered as an important theoretical basis for CSR contributes to clarifying the entities for which they are responsible. Consequently, to dispel the notion that company directors are merely shareholder agents, they should prioritize the rights and interests of all legitimate stakeholders and strive to satisfy their needs to the greatest extent possible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">McGuinness et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Theory of Based on Available Resources: Penrose was the first one who introduce its concept in 1959, where he pointed out that the firm’s growth arises and is reduced based on its unique and rare resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Kor et al., 2016</xref>). One of the most important definitions of the concept of strategic resources is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Barney (1991)</xref> explained as those resources that are characterized by rare values, which are difficult to imitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Barney, 1991</xref>). In order for companies to achieve their goal of seeking strategic resources, they should strive to form friendly and collaborative relationships with stakeholders that reflect trust and support among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Damanpour, 1992</xref>). Companies shall also fulfill obligations towards shareholders, investors, bondholders, and governments to secure the same aforementioned goal. Strategic resources can also contribute to maintaining a greater level of external capital, political subsidies, as well as tax incentives.</p><p>Numerous studies, however, have shown that the functions performed by firms determine how they gain a competitive advantage. To achieve this, unique resources are necessary for creating value through the allocation and effective use of available assets. Additionally, the development of these resources largely depends on the company's IC function, as long as the value creation processes align with how resources are managed by companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.2. Corporate social responsibility (csr)</title>
          
          <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Bowen (2013)</xref> defines from an ethical perspective the concept of CSR, noting that entrepreneurs must make decisions of dealing in accordance with social values and goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Bowen, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, Johnson shows the general frameworks of stakeholders regarding the commitment of companies to the interests of all parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Johnson, 1973</xref>). In other words, companies should not only focus on achieving economic value for shareholders, but must take into account the requirements of all stakeholders, especially society, in terms of ethical, environmental, and social values. This can be established through the level of credibility of the company and the enhancement of its image and reputation through the participation of all parties with information related to social responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). It is also the cumulative level of reliability that companies create by performing social responsibilities that allows or prevents potential damage to the company's value during crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Flammer, 2018</xref>). In other expression, CSR contributes to the creation of capital through greater support from governments and society alike.</p>

            <title>2.3. Internal control (ic)</title>
          
          <p>The concept of IC refers to the processes and systems established and tracked by the company in order to ensure the integrity of accounting information in its disclosed reports, prevent fraud, and reduce the risk of errors, and irregularities by taking the necessary corrective measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). Many studies indicate a strong relationship between CSR and IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>). With the ideal control system, managers will work to monitor their behavior towards workers and investors and their compliance with the instructions and legislation regulating the work of these companies, which contributes to enhancing the sense of CSR. For example, companies involved under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have a negative association between CSR and regulatory system deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Saleha et al., 2020</xref>). In other words, companies that meet their CSRS’ obligations well have higher quality in implementing IC. Conversely, companies that achieve a weak relative commitment to their responsibilities with regard to CSR disclosure information reflect the extent of deficiencies in their ICs’ system. Thus, it can be said that the objective of IC and CSR is related to the personality of the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Song et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al. (2024)</xref> explain on the association among IC and the firm’s reputation of the institution. For example, based on stakeholder theory, the firm value increases when information reflecting the integrity of the IC system is well disclosed. Society and stakeholders, shareholders, investors, and employees are increasingly confident in companies that are characterized by the quality of an effective control system that contributes to promoting the concept of sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Saleh et al., 2025</xref>). Conversely, weak IC systems may exacerbate the problem of information asymmetry, which increases the risk of manipulation and low level of cooperation between society and governments with these companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">Widagdo et al., 2022</xref>). Here comes the role of CSR as an external governance mechanism that performs the functions of the internal governance functions that contributes to enhancing the transparency and reducing the self-interest of the administration, which positively affects the efficiency of strategic objectives and the reputation and performance of the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Saleh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.4. Digital transformation technologies (dtt)</title>
          
          <p>Recently, empirical studies indicate the importance of using modern DTT in firm’s value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Jameel et al., 2025</xref>). For example, through artificial intelligence techniques such big data analytical tool, blockchain, cloud computing, management could build new organizational structures and new systems that contribute in developing business performance, as well as pursuing continuous competitive advantages in similar markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Barreto et al., 2025</xref>). DTT also contribute to the optimal allocation of resources as well as reduce the impact of uncertainty resulting from external factors on companies through the analysis of effective data flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, DTT also affect production efficiency, innovation and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>). Evidences have shown that DT can reduce the level of waste of production, administrative and marketing costs in a way that ensures the optimal allocation of resources in a way that enhances production efficiency and accelerates growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Ren et al., 2023a</xref>). Moreover, it can reduce the external challenges faced by business enterprises, especially at the social level, improve the effectiveness of internal audit, and enhance the productivity of workers by improving the human capital structure and positively impacting the reputation of the enterprise. Another evidence has showed the impact of DT on innovation have also argued that DT increases investors' and society's awareness of companies, particularly those characterized by innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Jacoby et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, recent studies have made some conflicting claims about the impact of CSR and DT on firms' competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). The study concluded that DTT is playing a significant role to moderate the positive association among CSR and firm value. Furthermore, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Chen &amp;amp; Zhang, 2024</xref>) argue that DTT enhance the value of manufacturing companies without taking into account the potential environmental impact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Guo &amp;amp; Xu (2021)</xref> believe that DTT negatively affects the financial form of companies in the short term, which contributes to the laying off of hands that have been working in those companies for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Guo &amp;amp; Xu, 2021</xref>). In contrast, authors claim that only some US digitally entities were improved their performance via what is called “digital-savvy skills, digital intensity and context for action and interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Sousa-Zomer et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

          <p>Some studies believe that CSR may not be useful to improve the firm's reputation, because of its potential consumption of capital and human resources of the company, which can be used in other productive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the findings of the literature of recent studies have mentioned the possibility of using social responsibility to reduce risks, and the acquisition of social status by those institutions resulting from improving relations with stakeholders and their role in protecting the environment and serving society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Chang &amp;amp; Yoo, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The commitment of organizations to the dimensions of social responsibility with their economic, legal, social, and environmental requirements is the driving force behind strengthening the mental image of the reputation and increasing the profits of companies by improving working conditions, loyalty, and increasing productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>). In the same vein, build collaborative relationships with suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Mendes et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, companies that voluntarily fulfill their social and humanitarian responsibilities can gain support from multiple parties such as the government, thereby increasing public awareness and confidence in their reputations and offering more diverse support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Luo &amp;amp; Bhattacharya, 2009</xref>). From an economic and accounting perspective, these companies will be able to determine the financial budget allocated to spend on necessary social responsibility programs such as supporting education, health, and small productive projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Chang &amp;amp; Yoo, 2023</xref>). As well as allocating the necessary resources to improve the quality of products and services provided to customers, the hypothesis is formulated as follows.</p><p>H<sub>1</sub>: There is a statistically significant effect of CSR on a corporation’s reputation.</p>

            <title>3.2. The impact of internal control on the company’s reputation</title>
          
          <p>According to the Committee of Institutions (COSO) definition in 2013, emanating from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which set the guidelines for evaluating the IC’s level and risk management in institutions. The goal of IC is to ensure the efficiency, legitimacy, and reliability of operations, management style, and financial reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Länsiluoto et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have also concluded that effective internal control plays a role in reducing the company's cost and risk. Moreover, these studies indicate that IC can play a role in increasing the efficiency of the implementation of strategies and promoting the development of sustainable companies in their economic, social and environmental dimensions, which affects the image and reputation of the company for all relevant parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Zhang &amp;amp; Su, 2023</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the guidelines for the application of IC objectives—social responsibility issued by the Audit Bureau in 2011 require companies to faithfully fulfill their social obligations regarding corporate governance objectives. In addition, they set product (service) quality, environmental protection, resource service, employment promotion as well as financial reporting quality as IC objectives. These guidelines increase the practical value of CSR activities through effective internal control. In practice, a good IC system works to limit the risks that companies may face in the process of performing their social responsibilities by increasing risk awareness and improving the way management works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). Hence, the following hypothesis can be written as below.</p><p>H<sub>2</sub>: Internal control positively enhances the improvement of corporate reputation.</p>

            <title>3.3. The moderating role of dt on the relationship between csr and cr</title>
          
          <p>Recently, DT’s adoption has become an important strategy for enterprises in their future economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Ren et al., 2023a</xref>). This interest at the government level in accelerating the DT of ministries and public institutions, especially in automating the regulatory and financial processes of transactions, has emerged as a major driving force to promote high-quality development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Achim, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Among the most prominent references to DTT are those related to big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence that help in analyzing and processing internal and external data with high efficiency, which serve the administration in saving effort and time and in decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Karim et al., 2022</xref>). To realize the scope of business, DT can mitigate the asymmetry of information, quickly meet the needs of various stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Gouvea et al., 2022</xref>), as this is done by sending early alerts and signals to identifies the quality of service and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Cardinali &amp;amp; De Giovanni, 2022</xref>), through automating the operational processes of companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">Vogler &amp;amp; Eisenegger, 2021</xref>). Thus, securing and enhancing the sustainability of companies through DTT has become a key issue for members of society, policymakers and companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Forcadell et al., 2020</xref>). According to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Ionaşcu et al., 2022</xref>), using DT can help businesses to perform their responsibilities towards social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Ionaşcu et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore. Fintech like AI, Big data analytical tools, and blockchain can be used to effectively address the problems by increasing recordability and traceability.</p><p>A study by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>) concluded that there is a positive relationship between CSR and CR, and DT might influence this relationship. Also, a study via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Liu et al. (2024)</xref> indicates that DT enhances of CSRs by easing financial constraints and enhancing the transparency of IC’s information within companies. Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Sang et al., 2025</xref>) indicates that digital transformation significantly enhances companies’ performance in ESG by improving resource allocation efficiency. Specifically, the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Baharom, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Ren et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Sang et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>) focused on the relationship between TD and social responsibility in advanced economies. Those studies did not examine the combined impact of CSR on CR within the context of DTT. The current study aims to close the gap by build a comprehensive framework that focuses on testing the impact of social responsibility on CR within the context of DTT in an emerging environment. Based on the above, the hypothesis related to the moderating role of DT can be developed according to the following.</p><p>H<sub>3</sub>: The impact of CSR on CR varies according to the level of DTT.</p>

          <p>Organizations pursuing DT may face significant risks due to the challenges and uncertainties arising from the instability of the digital environment. In this process, and as a governance system that considers stakeholder relationships in a balanced manner, an IC system can mitigate uncertainty and risks associated with business activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">Terentieva et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Li et al. (2024)</xref> also claim that DT enhances the effectiveness of internal controls. Consequently, companies strengthen the DT mechanism, which facilitates effective government integration, increases the productivity of production factors, improves the executive structure, coordinates the digital strategy, and helps companies provide understandable reporting. A study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al., 2024</xref>) IC strengthens the link between DT and firm value.</p><p>Furthermore, digital technologies have greatly enhanced the transparency of internal information, reduced improper manipulation of processes, improved stakeholders’ ability to oversee information, and thus enhanced CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Fu, 2025</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Baharom (2025)</xref> emphasizes the integration of advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, continuous auditing and blockchain to improve IC processes. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Baharom (2025)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yoo et al. (2024)</xref> focus on the association between DT and IC in advanced economies. These studies however, have not examined the combined impact of IC on firm reputation within the context of DTT. This is where the gap lies in this study, which aims to build a comprehensive framework that focuses on testing the impact of IC on organizational reputation within the context of DTT in an emerging environment. Based on the above, the hypothesis related to the modified role of DT can be developed according to the following.</p><p>H<sub>4</sub>: The Impact of IC on CR varies according to the level of use of DTT.</p><p>Furthermore, the hypothetical framework of the study can be illustrated as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

The DT moreover enables firms to performance their social responsibilities in better way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Ionaşcu et al., 2022</xref>). </p><p>Specifically, DTT reduces the positive impact of social responsibility on CR, perhaps because the Iraqi business environment is still experiencing less mature beginnings of digital transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Phornlaphatrachakorn &amp;amp; Kalasindhu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Zhang &amp;amp; Zhao, 2023</xref>). In addition, companies may witness an increase in investment in digital systems, which leads to competition in resources between digital transformation and social responsibility initiatives, which places additional burdens on these initiatives and weakens their repercussions on the reputation of companies, not because of the weakness of the initiative itself, but because it is affected by changing management priorities and resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Masoud &amp;amp; Basahel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">Zou et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Fourth hypothesis: For the purpose of testing the impact of IC on the reputation of the institution varies according to the difference in digital transformation techniques, a multiple linear regression model will be prepared to estimate the reputation of the institution in terms of IC and DT as an interactive variable, to examine the extent to which the latter affects the reputation of the institution.

Consequently, companies strengthen their DTT which facilitates effective government integration, increases factor productivity, improves the executive structure, coordinates digital strategy, and helps companies achieve high-quality development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Li et al., 2024</xref>).

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>First, corporate social responsibility seeks to improve the market value and optimal consumption of company resources, which maximizes the interests of stakeholders. Recently in the business world, CSR is considered an opportunity and strategy that serves the company’s reputation. From this perspective, our findings demonstrated that CSR activities had a positive ethical impact on company value and reputation. </p><p>Second, empirical studies show that the function of internal control is to further improve company performance and foster a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and company reputation. The results of the current study indicate that effective internal control helps protect the interests of stakeholders, enhances stability and performs important strategic functions to reduce potential risks and uncertainties associated with digital transformation from adopting qualitative economic strategies directed towards sustainable development.</p><p>Third, turning to the importance of the impact of digital transformation as an interactive variable in the relationship between corporate social responsibility and the organization’s reputation, the results showed that 54% of the changes that occur in the organization’s reputation and performance are the result of implementing digital transformation mechanisms. The impact of digital transformation has been weak, perhaps because the Iraqi business environment is still witnessing less mature beginnings in adopting digital transformation initiatives, in addition to regular and cultural issues. This places additional burdens on these initiatives and has repercussions on the reputation of companies, not because of the weakness of the initiative itself, but because it is affected by changing management priorities and resource allocation. </p><p>Fourth, the study also explored the positive DT’s influence on the relationship between IC and CR, which is consistent with evidence in the literature review. Such technologies are significantly enhancing the transparency of information, reducing improper manipulation of financial processes, and enhancing stakeholders’ trust. Although the data were collected from a sample of accountants, auditors, and other professionals working in the Iraqi environment, the findings of this study could offer valuable insights into emerging markets characterized by digital technology adoption, given that Iraq is a unique emerging market context. However, these results should be interpreted within this context, and they are generalizable to environments with similar institutional conditions.</p><p>Moreover, this study has several implications for regulators by providing useful information that supports the development of effective business policies. At the investor level, this study can help them make decisions by evaluating investment returns and risks. In addition, it affects stakeholders by increasing transparency in reporting and communication and enhancing the reputation of companies.</p>

      <title>7. Limitations and future studies</title>
      <p>First, the authors relied on an academic questionnaire, the Iraq Stock Exchange database. The current study does not reveal the results of evaluating the detailed elements divided into shareholder, employee, supplier consumer rights, and environmental responsibilities. Therefore, this study did not provide information on the discriminatory effects on CSR subsectors. If possible, a study is conducted in which actual financial data are available to analyze and present the impact of the interaction between the sub-region and DT on the company's value, which can help remove these obstacles.</p><p>Second, Future studies could expand the scope of this study to include other countries or compare the results with countries that have varying levels of corporate governance practices and digital maturity. The study recommends using the content analysis method to measure the level of DT and link it to the level of quality of reports, financial disclosure, and financial performance, or the risk management committee and attracting foreign investment, and cybersecurity risks as a tool of financial technology as alternative variables.</p>
