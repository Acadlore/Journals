      <abstract><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The WBM’s viscosity, gel strength and ability to filter and control the filtration rate are central to the stabilization of the well bore as well as the transportation of the cuttings to the surface.  WBM is comprehensively inexpensive and eco-friendly; it does not hinder the biodegradation process as compared to other chemicals that may be used in the drilling involving rig activities. It cans thermally change, regulate formation pressure, and support cuttings. WBM is also can be used in all types of formations and is not complicated in terms of its handling as well as disposing as compared to other drilling fluids. However, WBM has some limitations as it is influenced by shale hydration, formation water salinity and thermally less stable at high temperature formations. Hindered by formation solids, fluid loss to the formation and formation damage are other issues that must be dealt with efficiently during the drilling process using WBM. WBM is used in most practices of drilling especially in offshore drilling areas, environment sensitive areas, and areas that have certain restrictions on the types of fluids to be used in drilling. Effectiveness and flexibility in relation to various platforms and various rigs make it a prime candidate for the most orthodox as well as the most innovative operations. Some of the regular water based muds that are often in use are Spud mud, Low solid polymer mud KCl, PHPA polymer mud KCl, Glycol polymer mud, Salt Saturated mud and Drill – in mud.</p></abstract>
