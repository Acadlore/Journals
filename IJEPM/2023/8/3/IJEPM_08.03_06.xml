      <abstract><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">University campuses in Iraq are substantial energy consumers, with consumption increasing significantly during periods of high temperatures, underscoring the necessity to enhance their energy performance. Energy simulation tools offer valuable insights into evaluating and improving the energy efficiency of buildings. This study focuses on simulating passive architectural design for three selected buildings at Al-Khwarizmi College of Engineering (AKCOE) to examine the effectiveness of their cooling systems. DesignBuilder software was employed, and climatic data for a year in Baghdad was collected to assess the influence of passive architectural strategies on the thermal performance of the targeted buildings. The simulations revealed that the implementation of passive architectural design in AKCOE buildings led to a decrease in energy consumption for cooling purposes. Energy savings were achieved through natural ventilation, which minimized heat gain, and by employing continuous sun protection with double-glazed windows. By adopting a passive cooling strategy in AKCOE facilities, annual energy consumption for cooling within the campus could potentially be reduced by up to 23.6 percent. In conclusion, it was found that the current glazing system utilized in Iraqi building construction significantly contributes to electrical energy consumption.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Intorduction</title>
      <p>Iraq is among the world’s leading carbon emitters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], with various sectors including campuses, residential buildings, public and private buildings, firms, and agricultural and company buildings relying heavily on unclean energy sources. A significant proportion of this energy consumption originates from the combustion of fossil fuels, leading to considerable environmental pollution. Inefficient building construction methods exacerbate environmental degradation in Iraq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], which is further intensified by rapid urbanization due to population growth, desertification resulting from the conversion of green spaces into residential areas, and diminished water resources due to dam construction by neighboring countries on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. In response to these challenges, the adoption of passive building design strategies in new Iraqi cities and the retrofitting of existing buildings to conserve energy have become imperative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Passive energy strategies harness renewable resources, such as solar and wind energy, to satisfy the heating, cooling, and ventilation needs of buildings, thus obviating the requirement for mechanical HVAC systems. The implementation of passive energy strategies yields numerous advantages, including the minimization of temperature differences between indoor and outdoor spaces, the enhancement of indoor air quality through effective filtration, and the creation of a more comfortable building environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Additionally, these strategies contribute to the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, fostering a positive environmental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Design approaches that curtail reliance on mechanical cooling systems encompass strategic window placement, daylight utilization, appropriate glazing for windows and skylights, and the use of shading elements to prevent excessive heat gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>The Energy Strategy Incompetent Building (ESIB) necessitates at least one retrofitting stage to reduce energy consumption, which may consist of enhancing cooling system efficiency and improving the building envelope through effective thermal insulation in the roofing system. The implementation of passive strategies, corroborated by DesignBuilder simulations, has demonstrated considerable reductions in energy usage in ESIB residential buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. These strategies predominantly aim to optimize HVAC system performance by lowering internal temperatures and minimizing overall energy consumption in buildings.</p><p>Improving a building’s structure constitutes an effective strategy for conserving energy, minimizing wastage and loss, and reducing overall energy consumption. A comprehensive understanding of the energy demand profile and identification of the sources of energy consumption in buildings are essential for implementing appropriate measures to effectively reduce energy costs. Heat ingress into ESIB buildings through the window glazing system constitutes a significant contributor to energy consumption, necessitating mitigation through double and/or tinted glazing options.</p><p>Numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] have relied on historical weather data files acquired from weather centers or airports, which are often situated outside city limits and may not accurately represent the prevailing conditions in densely built areas. Conventional procedures, employing hourly, daily, and yearly analyses based on weather data files from weather centers, have proven valuable in evaluating retrofitting processes and recommending energy-saving modeling techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, the development of new weather measurement technologies has enabled the provision of more accurate and timely weather data, facilitating precise monitoring of weather changes at hourly or even sub-hourly intervals. These advancements offer enhanced capabilities for comprehensive energy-saving analyses.</p><p>The objective of this study is to reduce energy consumption in targeted buildings (lecturing building, deanship building, and postgraduate lecturing building of the AKCOE) by implementing various building construction strategies. The impact of retrofitting on electricity, lighting, and HVAC systems will be investigated by comparing energy consumption with and without the retrofitting measures in place. User-friendly simulation tools, such as DesignBuilder software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] and EnergyPlus software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], will be employed to utilize a virtual retrofitting approach, generating performance data. Additionally, energy consumption patterns across different months based on building occupancy will be analyzed and compared, evaluating existing strategies of the targeted buildings with and without incorporating passive architectural patterns.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the relevant characteristics of the buildings targeted in this study. Section 3 elaborates on the materials and methods employed. Section 4 reports the main findings. Section 5 discusses the salient and significant simulation outcomes. Section 6 summarizes the conclusions reached.</p>

      <title>2. Attributes of targeted building</title>
      <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">Three standard-height buildings located in the University of Baghdad area in Al-Jadriya city, Baghdad province, Iraq, were chosen as the evaluation buildings. These include a two-floor lecturing building, a two-floor deanship building, and a one-floor postgraduate lecturing rooms building of the AKCOE. The lecturing building has the highest energy consumption among the three buildings due to its size. All three buildings lack basement floors and have a construction life of approximately ten years. The lecturing building has a north-east exposure, while the deanship building and postgraduate lecturing rooms have north-east and south-east exposure, respectively, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The targeted buildings are situated at the AKCOE on 33°16'13.5"N (latitude) and 44°22'26.0"E (longitude), 34m above sea level. The AKCOE is a medium-densely-occupied college located on a peninsula on the banks of the Tigris River. The architecture of the targeted buildings has evolved over time without urban planning, primarily based on functional needs. However, there are some green open areas around the buildings and that will be benefit to reduce the air temperature. The floor footprint and dimensions of the three buildings were obtained through schematics provided by the construction unit at the AKCOE to explore their infrastructures and internal layouts. The lecturing building consists of eight divided corridors and approximately 12 separate spaces (halls) in each department. The length and width of each floor are 54m and 102m, respectively, with a gross footprint area of approximately 5508m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif"> per department. After excluding the unconditioned corridors area, the conditioned space is approximately 3384m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">. Details and dimensions of the lecturing building, e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. The deanship building has three passages, two on the ground floor and one on the first floor, including around 20 separate spaces for administration offices. The length and width of each floor are 21m and 16.8m, respectively, with a gross footprint area of approximately 353m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">. The conditioned space in its two floors, using split air-conditioning systems, is approximately 529m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">. The detailed dimensions of this building are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. The postgraduate lecturing building is divided into two passages with around 20 separate spaces for lecturing rooms. The overall footprint area is about 755m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">, and a split air-conditioning system is used to cool some of the lecturing rooms with a total area of about 655m<sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">2</sup><span style="font-family: Times, serif">. The footprint details of this building, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. The average temperature in Baghdad ranges from 34<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">℃<span style="font-family: Times, serif"> to 48<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">℃<span style="font-family: Times, serif"> in July and -2<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">℃<span style="font-family: Times, serif"> to 10<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">℃<span style="font-family: Times, serif"> in January, making it important for these buildings to satisfy cooling demands during the hot Iraqi summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. In DesignBuilder, we meticulously entered the architectural blueprints of the targeted buildings, meticulously documenting all construction methodologies and materials employed, including the utilization of iron for external doors and wood for internal doors. It is worth noting that in Iraq, the months of July and August witness a substantial number of days off, totaling 62 days. Occupancy levels within the buildings exhibit fluctuation throughout the day, commencing at 7 o’clock in the morning with a modest number of occupants and gradually increasing until reaching approximately 80% of the total capacity between the hours of 9 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. The surge in occupancy directly correlates with heightened energy consumption due to the operation of numerous computers, laboratories, and various additional equipment, leading to a significant increase in energy demand, particularly during these peak load periods. Furthermore, the prevailing weather conditions play a substantial role, with temperatures soaring during these hours compared to the remainder of the day.</p>

The lecturing building consists of two floors representing thermal zones distributed in five scientific departments (two on the first floor and three on the second floor). Each floor contains lecturing classrooms of two departments and their head of departments’ offices, lecturers’ rooms, and some laboratories. The deanship building is a two-floor building that includes several employees’ offices (thermal zones) and the college's deanship division. The postgraduate lecturing building is a one-floor building that looks like the letter T.</p>

Therefore, the cooling temperature setpoint is the desired input that the cooling system attempts to control or adjust to returning the conditions back to an appropriate response (setpoint), which should be settled within an acceptable range. The occupied comfort cooling setpoint temperature during occupied hours considering mean radiant temperature, operation periods of cooling and ventilation systems, and targeted buildings occupancy, according to the gathered data from the field study, were carefully inserted in DesignBuilder. The cooling system was consistently settled and regulated to run when the indoor temperature attains or fluctuates around (23℃). We decided on this value by considering the operative cooling temperature in the cooling system control, where the mean radiant temperature was prophesied with 94% accuracy through a regression equation by applying the weather information and the indoor thermal environment data.

          <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The effect of architecture on energy consumption represents the most vital challenge nowadays. To reduce energy consumption and improve the performance of the buildings, hence reduce the effect of greenhouse gases on our environment produced by using inefficient designs, via developing the essential methodologies the modern architectures deal with, it is necessary to resort to the use of passive design strategies that be used either during construction or the procedures of retrofit. This study will base on three types of building energy-improving methods: double glazing, high solar reflection insulator, and louver shading device, and their effects when adding them to the targeted buildings will well mentioned.</p>

These slats are horizontally superimposed and tilted 45 degrees (rotation angle). Therefore, the purpose of shading is to block the sunlight during the summer but permit them through in the winter and ignore the heat while allowing the light the targeted space needs to pass and benefit from them.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Most heat gain or loss in our three targeted buildings comes from windows, the main elements that transfer heat between the buildings and their outside environment. In the case of the double glazing methodology, the window’s thermal insulation depends on the cavity between the two glass panels. In this design, the distance formed between the two glass sheets can be filled and deflated from gas or can be filled with argon to reduce heat transfer. A good value of the Solar Heat Gains Coefficient SHGC of glass was used (around 17%).</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Argon gas is more tightened than the air (1.7836 kg/m<sup><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">3</sup><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif"> at a temperature of 0℃). Consequently, filling the hollow glass with argon gas instead of air reduces the gas’s thermal conductivity hence heat convection. The relative publications have mentioned that to save energy and achieve thermal comfort in buildings, the lighting, humidity, temperature, and noise should be carefully considered. The single-panel glazing style, the current style used in the targeted buildings, was replaced by double-panel glazing containing argon gas inside its cavity of 13mm instead of air because it does not affect visible light breakthrough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The insulator in walls, ceilings, and floors of any building reduces or eliminates heat loss on cold days and reduces heat gain on hot days to keep weather comforting inside the buildings in the winter and summer both, where the insulator works as a barrier to any flow type of heat energy. Therefore, the passive design for the targeted buildings should contain well insulation to reduce heat loss or gain across their roofs. In this simulation, a polystyrene material will be utilized as an insulator on the roofing of the three targeted buildings.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">These three strategies were selected based on their suitability to the prevailing local climate and their prevalence in our region. Additionally, considering that our building has already been constructed, retrofitting options are limited.</p>

      <title>5. Results</title>
      <p>In the following two paragraphs, the results of the modeling mainly depend on existing design and construction characteristics that use in the model. For instance, the initial configuration of the desired buildings, including their construction materials, was inputted into the software. After that, we will show the simulation outcomes, which carried out on those buildings after making possible modifications from their thermal insulations, glazing system, and shading strategy that will reduce their current energy consumptions. The U-value of window glass is one of the factors affecting the cooling process of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. The U-value is a measure of thermal transmittance through the building's fabric, indicating the efficiency of an insulated glass unit (IGU) in retaining heated or cooled air. A lower U-value signifies better insulation performance, with values ranging from minimal heat loss to significant heat loss, which give the opposite. In our paper, we will present the U-value measurements before and after implementing the double glazing strategy in the building. The effectiveness of this strategy is evident in the noticeable reduction of the U-value. The higher the U-value, the greater the cooling energy expenditure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref> shows the U-value for window glass before and after the retrofitting.</p>

      <p>These measurements exclude two summer holiday months (July and August) to include four working months, March, April, May, and June, covering the summer season of 2021. The hot and dry weather in Iraq during the summer requires massive electricity to operate the cooling systems, so electricity is the most used in summertime. High electricity consumption is usually associated with high energy consumption as well.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">The results show that the energy consumption for cooling reduced from 62 Mwh to 51 Mwh per month for the deanship building (nearly 22.64%), and so on for the other targeted buildings, e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>. The cooling energy consumption is only relevant for the summer months, as the air conditioner is switched off during the winter season for the targeted buildings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> shows the amount of energy consumption before and after adding passive strategies.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">Conducting a thermal energy performance simulation is crucial for assessing the interior and exterior heat gain or loss in buildings, particularly older ones that lack ideal thermal performance. Such buildings often rely on outdated cooling and heating systems that are not energy-efficient.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">To reduce energy expenditure and maintain comfortable indoor conditions, different passive design strategies were employed, as described in Section of (Passive Design Strategies Proposed). These strategies involved modifying the existing construction of the target buildings to achieve energy savings. The lecturing building, due to its higher occupancy, showed higher energy consumption initially, but after incorporating passive design strategies, its energy consumption decreased.</p>

                <title>6.3.1 Energy consumption outcomes</title>
              
              <p>Comparing energy consumption before and after retrofitting the buildings revealed noticeable changes. The retrofitted buildings exhibited reduced energy consumption. Specifically, the lecturing building saw a decrease from 391,274.28 kWh to 390,120.83 kWh, the deanship building decreased from 356,659.35 kWh to 292,329.52 kWh, and the postgraduate lecturing building decreased from 1,130,690.14 kWh to 1,034,489.38 kWh.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">Although the energy consumption reduction may appear modest, the cumulative impact over time will result in significant cost savings for cooling these buildings. Additionally, the deanship building, with its smaller footprint and minimal glazing, demonstrated lower energy expenditures compared to the other buildings, particularly the postgraduate lecturing building with extensive glazing.</p>

                <title>6.3.3 Influence of u-value and passive design strategies</title>
              
              <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">The study clearly demonstrates that the current glazing system used in Iraq’s building construction is a significant contributor to electrical energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need to raise awareness and provide guidance on adopting modern glazing systems that are suitable for Iraq's climatic conditions. While extensive glazing can be beneficial during the winter season, a logical assessment of cold and hot periods suggests the use of modern systems that effectively support air conditioning in both seasons, particularly the summer. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref> showcases the impact of passive design strategies on the U-value, specifically for single glazing windows with a thickness of 6mm. The U-value significantly decreased after retrofitting, particularly when employing the double-glazing strategy, which effectively halved the U-value for all facades. This highlights the substantial role of passive design strategies in reducing cooling energy consumption during the summer.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times, serif">Heat gains in non-retrofitted buildings originate from various sources such as walls, ceilings, floors, ground floors, partitions, roofs, lights, miscellaneous equipment, occupancy, solar radiation, and corridor zones. Notably, the increase in solar gains through large windows and the first-floor roof, followed by occupancy and walls, contributed most significantly to heat gains.</p>

      <title>7. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Although Baghdad is an ancient, densely-populated city, there are still opportunities to make significant changes and create an attractive, green urban environment with excellent architectural characteristics. The hot, dry weather in Iraq significantly affects the thermal performance of the targeted buildings due to inefficient opening and enveloping systems. Retrofitting proved to be highly beneficial in improving their energy performance. To enhance the accuracy of DesignBuilder simulation and achieve better energy evaluation, it would be advantageous to have localized weather measurements inside the targeted buildings, providing more realistic and detailed data on energy consumption.</p><p>The simulation work conducted in this study focused on retrofitting three buildings within the Al-Khwarizmi College of Engineering using passive strategies. A comparison was made between the energy consumption of the retrofitted buildings and their original architecture to assess the impact of urban-style construction on electricity and energy usage over the course of a year. The findings reveal significant differences in energy consumption among the respective targeted buildings, particularly when considering long-term operation. While various passive design strategies exist, this simulation focused on assessing the energy consumption reduction achieved through passive strategies applied to building envelopes, walls, exterior windows, and roofs-the primary sources of heat transfer between the interior and exterior of buildings. The aim of this simulation work was to provide guidance for evaluating the impact of different passive strategies on existing Iraqi architecture and their potential for transforming urban residential buildings.</p><p>It should be noted that the targeted buildings in this study are situated in areas with good afforestation and ample green spaces, contributing to evaporative cooling and mitigating heat in the building surroundings. This, in turn, reduces internal temperatures and lowers energy consumption for cooling. This may explain the relatively small difference in energy consumption observed before and after retrofitting, despite its significance. To optimize Iraqi university campuses and achieve energy-efficient buildings, especially during the hot summer months, effective means of sustainable cooling strategies need to be implemented. Future work will explore sustainable cooling strategies in Iraq, including the utilization of renewable energy sources such as geothermal, wind turbines, and solar energy.</p>
