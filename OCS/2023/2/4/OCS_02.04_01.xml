      <abstract><p>This study employed Schwartz's basic value theory and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to elucidate environmentally sustainable tourist behaviour (ESTB) among Muslim tourists in Indonesia. Two central inquiries were examined. Firstly, the impact of intrapersonal environmental and non-environmental values on the ESTB of Muslim tourists was scrutinised. Secondly, the mediating role of environmental attitude (EA) on these intrapersonal values towards ESTB in Muslim-friendly destinations in Indonesia was assessed. A cross-sectional survey, conducted in June and July 2022, collected data from 300 Muslim tourists at Muslim-friendly destinations in Indonesia. Participants, aged 17 and above, were selected through a purposive sampling approach; they had obtained a CHSE certificate in Malang during the transition from epidemic to the new normal era and had visited at least one of the 26 Muslim-friendly tourist spots. Analysis using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) revealed that while environmental knowledge (EK) and attitudes positively influenced ESTB, environmental concern (EC) and religious value (RGV) did not demonstrate a direct impact. Moreover, it was discerned that EA played a significant mediating role between RGV, EC, EK, and environmentally sustainable behaviours. It was further observed that individuals endorsing egoistic values typically exhibited weaker pro-environmental beliefs and were less inclined towards pro-environmental actions. Conversely, those with altruistic values displayed stronger pro-environmental beliefs, consequently impacting their environmental sustainability behaviour (ESB) in Muslim-friendly tourist destinations.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Schwartz's theory of basic values, combined with the TPB, was employed to investigate ESTB. A marked rise, approximately 30% since 2016, in the number of Muslim tourists globally has been reported by Master Card Crescent Rating. As a result of rigorous efforts, Indonesia emerged as a leading Muslim-friendly tourist destination, surpassing the standards set by the 2019 Global Muslim Travel Index (GMTI). Such recognition potentially positions Indonesia to attract tourists globally. Nevertheless, the declaration of Covid-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020 severely affected the tourism sector, especially the Muslim-friendly niche. For Indonesia to compete internationally, especially targeting the burgeoning market of Muslim tourists, the development of Muslim-friendly tourism is postulated as a critical strategic positioning strategy. It is further contended that Muslim-friendly tourism could be employed as a recovery strategy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Drawing from the GMTI 2021 rankings, Indonesia currently stands at the fourth position after Malaysia, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. This ranking accentuates the need for a comprehensive strategy involving multiple stakeholders: the government, service providers in the tourism sector, the hotel and restaurant industry, and tourists themselves. Concurrently, the Indonesian government's endeavours to bolster the creative economy and local tourism are evidenced by the implementation of Cleanliness, Health, Safety, Environment Friendly (CHSE) protocols. This alignment with CHSE is posited to coincide with the growing tourist interest in eco-friendly travel. The business sector has also perceived 'greening' as pivotal, influencing various market segments. A gradual increase in public awareness regarding environmental issues has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Han &amp;amp; Kim, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It has been postulated by certain academicians that environmental sustainability challenges can be addressed through fostering eco-friendly behaviour in individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Han, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Steg &amp;amp; Vlek, 2009</xref>). Over recent decades, sustainable behaviour has garnered significant attention across academic circles and among the general populace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Garvey &amp;amp; Bolton, 2017</xref>). Eco-friendly tourism is conceptualised as travel which, at the minimum, doesn't harm the environment at both local and global levels, and optimally might even enhance it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Fenitra et al., 2021</xref>). Such tourists have been identified variously as green tourists, sustainable tourists, or eco-friendly travellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Juvan &amp;amp; Dolnicar, 2017</xref>). Previous research has highlighted a distinct correlation between the beliefs and behaviours of green consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Arslan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Barr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Gadenne et al., 2011</xref>). However, studies exploring EA using the theory of reasoned action approach (TRA) and TPB indicated disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Ajzen &amp;amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Pickett-Baker &amp;amp; Ozaki, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the exploration of intrapersonal, non-environmental characteristics, RGV emerged as a significant facet. It has been posited that tourists' inclination towards environmentally responsible behaviour is influenced by a myriad of internal and external drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Han &amp;amp; Hyun, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Han &amp;amp; Hyun, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Han &amp;amp; Yoon, 2015</xref>). Among these, intrapersonal components, encompassing emotions and attitudes, were identified to exert a more pronounced influence on tourists' participation in environmentally beneficial actions, while extrinsic determinants were found to be less impactful on such behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Han et al., 2018</xref>). Religious ideals, considered as one variant of intrapersonal elements, are proposed to substantially shape the behaviours of environmentally-conscious individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Hasnah Hassan, 2014</xref>). It is acknowledged that a plethora of religions and religious tenets exist globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Minton, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, a prevailing sentiment across the majority of these religions, as underpinned by environmental ecology theory, is the interconnectedness of all life and the inherent inclusion of every individual as a fragment of nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Yang &amp;amp; Huang, 2018</xref>). In this context, RGV are perceived as environmental ethics. Specifically, these personal values encapsulate facets of self-transcendence, inclusive of universalism, altruism, and mandates of virtue, which actively steer ethical benchmarks and personal norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Padel &amp;amp; Foster, 2005</xref>).</p><p>EC has been deemed a crucial precursor, positively associated with eco-friendly behaviour. Typically, it's examined as the individual's behavioural assessment in the context of ecological or natural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Okumah et al., 2020</xref>). EC encompasses an individual's level of concern about environmental issues, emotional evaluations of these problems, and willingness to support rectification efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Felix et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>EK has been pinpointed as vital for the sustainability intent/behaviour concerning hospitality/tourism products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Chan et al., 2014</xref>). EK pertains to the information individuals possess about environmental issues and their competency to comprehend and evaluate their societal and environmental impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Chekima et al., 2016</xref>). EK's paramount role in defining eco-friendly behaviour has been underscored, with many studies suggesting a positive influence of environmental awareness on ESB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Kang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Taufique et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, an information deficit has been observed to negatively impact green purchasing behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Connell, 2010</xref>).</p><p>EA has been described as a relatively stable evaluation pertaining to situations, issues, or actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Okumah et al., 2020</xref>). EA encapsulates individual beliefs, concerns, values, and intentions around environmental matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Groening et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, EA is believed to reflect personal beliefs regarding the outcomes of green consumer behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ajzen &amp;amp; Cote, 2008</xref>).</p><p>This study seeks to elucidate the behaviour of Muslim tourists in Indonesia's Muslim-friendly tourism sector, rooted in Schwartz's theory of basic values. The pivotal research questions revolve around the influence of intrapersonal environmental and non-environmental values on Muslim tourists' ESB and the potential mediation of EA in this relationship within Muslim-friendly tourist destinations in Indonesia.</p>

          <p>Historically, values have been postulated to motivate and influence behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Fenitra et al., 2022</xref>). Within this scope, religion delineates numerous moral guidelines serving as life's tenets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Hasnah Hassan, 2014</xref>). Such foundations, as deduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Safie &amp;amp; Nazarpoor (2015)</xref>, exert profound influence on individuals' perceptions, subsequently delineating moral conduct boundaries. Studies have underscored the impact of religious beliefs on environmental consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Felix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Mustofa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Schultz et al., 2004</xref>). It has been elucidated in marketing studies that religious beliefs profoundly influence purchasing behaviours, and subsequently, these beliefs affect tourists' destination choices and product predilections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Essoo &amp;amp; Dibb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Weidenfeld &amp;amp; Ron, 2008</xref>). Empirical evidence suggests a positive correlation between religious beliefs and environmentally conscious behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

          <p>Rooted in the Schwartz model, altruistic actions are perceived within a socio-psychological behaviour spectrum. This model implicitly assumes an innate human value orientation favouring others' welfare, indicating a predisposition towards actions averting harm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Stern et al. (1993)</xref> augmented this perspective, introducing a robust theoretical matrix for environmental apprehension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Verma et al. (2019)</xref> established a significant correlation between EC and consumers' inclinations towards green hotel accommodations. Further, it has been determined that environmental cognizance augments pro-environmental consumer behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Bhuian et al., 2018</xref>). Studies further denote a significant relationship between guests' participative attitudes in green hotel initiatives and their EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Han et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

          <p>Several theoretical frameworks position knowledge as a pivotal determinant of sustainable conduct. This is evident in Ajzen's TBP, where knowledge contributes to perceived behavioural control, contingent on perceived behavioural intricacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Previous research underscores the influence of EK on attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Singh &amp;amp; Bansal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">Yeoh &amp;amp; Paladino, 2013</xref>). Moreover, consumer awareness has been found to wield significant influence on decision-making processes. Empirical studies have further revealed a positive relationship between EK and the intent to purchase green products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Juvan &amp;amp; Dolnicar, 2016</xref>).</p>

          <p>Drawing upon the theory of planned behaviour, attitude is conceptualised as a disposition reflecting either favourability or aversion towards a particular behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Attitudes toward environmental responsiveness culminate in pro-environmental behaviours. A plethora of research has endeavoured to elucidate the correlation between EA and respective behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Mustofa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Singh &amp;amp; Bansal, 2012</xref>).</p>

Individuals exhibiting heightened environmental awareness are posited to foster sustainable attitudes, resulting in tangible actions mitigating adverse environmental impacts in tourist locales. Consequently, EA has been postulated to serve as a mediating conduit between EC and sustainable tourist behaviours, as evidenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Yarimoglu &amp;amp; Gunay (2019)</xref>.</p><p>This literature review has delineated the intricate relationships between RGV, EA, EK, beliefs, and their respective influences on sustainable tourism behaviours.

          <p>In light of the prevailing epidemic, a quantitative methodology was adopted. An online survey was administered during June and July of 2022. Muslim visitors to Malang, who had been awarded a CHSE certificate during the transitional epidemic period and had either visited or were currently visiting one of the 26 designated Muslim-friendly tourist spots, were identified and approached. The sampling strategy employed was purposive, with criteria requiring respondents to be at least 17 years old. Malang Raya, situated in East Java, Indonesia, is recognised as one of the top destinations for Muslim travellers. These 26 venues were identified based on their CHSE certification and are illustrated in a geographical representation provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Of the digital surveys distributed, feedback was received from 330 respondents.

      <p>A sample size of 300 respondents was utilised in this study, meeting the stipulated sample size criterion as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Hair et al. (2019)</xref>. From the valid responses received, 66.33% were identified as female and the remaining 33.67% as male. In terms of age distribution, 44.41% were within the age range of 17–25 years, 15.65% aged 26–30, 14.70% between 31-40 years, 23% from 40-50 years, and 2.24% aged 50 and above. The respondent’s occupation distribution revealed that 39.33% were students, 10% held positions as ASN but not lecturers, a mere 0.67% were from TNI/POLRI, 28% were self-employed, 2% identified as housewives, 0.33% as doctors, and 19.67% as lecturers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>).</p>

          <p>An evaluation of the gathered data indicated a robust association between the items, validating convergent validity. The results revealed that both loading and AVE surpassed the 0.50 threshold, while Alpha and CR exceeded 0.70, consistent with the guidelines set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Hair et al.

Cronbach's alpha, at 0.837, and composite reliability, at 0.881, further substantiated the reliability of the measurements. Similar findings were observed for the EK and ESTB variables, with all values meeting the designated criteria (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

          <p>PLS-SEM, facilitated by SmartPLS software, was employed. Path analysis revealed a positive association between RGV and EC, substantiating H1. Positive associations were observed between RGV, EC, and EK with EA, thereby supporting H2, H4, and H6. However, only EK and EA exhibited a positive association with ESTB, leading to the acceptance of H7 and H8. Contrarily, H3 and H5, linking RGV and EC, respectively, to ESTB, were not substantiated. A significant mediating role of EA was discerned in the associations between RGV and ESTB, EC and EST, and EK and ESTB, leading to the validation of H9, H10, and H11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

      <p>The findings revealed a positive correlation between the comprehension of Muslim tourists' RGV and their EC. This aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Felix et al. (2018)</xref>, which proposed that religious individuals globally express heightened EC compared to their non-religious counterparts. Increasing the religious significance for Muslim travellers, it was found, elevates their EC at Muslim-friendly travel destinations. However, heightened religious significance in Muslim travellers did not directly foster environmentally sustainable behaviour. This resonates with the assertions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Martin &amp;amp; Bateman (2014)</xref> that profound commitment to intrapersonal religion doesn't necessarily induce ecocentric behaviour. Consequently, within Muslim-friendly travel destinations, tourists with profound religious commitment were observed to be less responsive to environmental messages or exhibited diminished eco-friendly behaviour than others.</p><p>Further findings suggested that an improved environmental consciousness among Muslim tourists augments their eco-friendly attitude at tourist destinations. This appears to contradict the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Verma et al. (2019)</xref>, who suggested that EC significantly moulds Indian consumers' attitudes towards green hotels. However, this EC doesn’t invariably translate into environmentally sustainable behaviour among tourists.</p><p>Building upon this, it was determined that knowledge about environmental issues moulds the disposition towards environmentally-friendly tourist behaviours. This discovery strengthens prior research, particularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Juvan &amp;amp; Dolnicar (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Fenitra et al. (2021)</xref>, advocating that environmental perceptions are amendable upon acquisition of relevant information. Tourists, when cognizant of the repercussions of their actions on the environment, tend to adopt sustainable practices.</p><p>Furthermore, EA was identified as a significant catalyst fostering environmentally friendly tourist behaviour. It was observed that as EA of Muslim tourists amplifies, the propensity for adverse behaviours diminishes in Muslim-friendly locations. This finding is congruent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Fenitra et al. (2021)</xref>, which suggests that a strong environmental disposition positively impacts sustainable behavioural intentions.</p><p>Significant contributions to the existing literature were made by examining the interplay of RGV and tourist sustainability concerning environmental values, attitudes, and behaviour. It was discerned that EA acts as a mediator between RGV and ESTB. Thus, the direct influence of RGV on ESTB is attenuated, necessitating its mediation through EA.</p><p>Furthermore, EA was found to bridge the gap between EC and ESTB. This implies that direct prediction of ESTB from EC might not be significant unless mediated by EA.</p><p>Lastly, a correlation was drawn between EK and ESTB, mediated by EA. The depth of the tourists' environmental expertise, combined with their genuine interest in environmental issues, was found to play a pivotal role in their behaviour at tourist destinations. This finding fortifies the knowledge-attitude-behaviour (KAB) model as elucidated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Felix &amp;amp; Braunsberger (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Siyavooshi et al. (2019)</xref>.</p><p>Recommendations for stakeholders:</p><ul><li><p>Managers overseeing Muslim-friendly tourist destinations should ensure comprehensive facilities, particularly focusing on sanitation, as feedback has indicated occasional inadequacies.</p></li><li><p>Policy makers, primarily the government, ought to continue endorsing and supervising the implementation of the CHSE certification at tourist destinations.</p></li><li><p>Adequate budget allocation is imperative for the upkeep of amenities at tourist destinations. Consideration could be given to integrating this cost into the fees levied on tourists, as some indicated willingness to incur additional expenses for enhanced services.</p></li></ul><p>In conclusion, EA plays an instrumental role in influencing environmentally sustainable behaviour among tourists at Muslim-friendly destinations. Systemic support from key stakeholders, including the government and tourism service providers, is essential to ensure adherence to service standards and foster environmental sustainability in the tourism industry.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Associations between RGV and EC were observed. Additionally, it was discerned that EK correlated with ESTB. Contrarily, RGV and EC were found to exert no direct influence on such behaviour. Mediation by EA was evident across religious beliefs, EC, and EK in relation to environmentally friendly tourist conduct.</p><p>This research offers notable insights into Schwartz's theory of basic values and the TPB. In accordance with cognitive dissonance predictions, tourists holding environmental beliefs often encounter psychological dissonance and guilt, particularly when failing to act in line with such beliefs. Those endorsing egoistic values were identified as being less inclined towards pro-environmental actions and holding weaker pro-environmental convictions. On the contrary, individuals upholding altruistic values were typically more predisposed to pro-environmental actions and possessed more entrenched pro-environmental convictions. Such tendencies were observed to impact their environmentally sustainable behaviours in Muslim-friendly tourist destinations.</p><p>The mediating role of EA across RGV, EC, EK, and ecologically friendly tourist behaviour was established. It is posited that the behaviours of Muslim tourists in Muslim-friendly locales are predominantly shaped by their EA.</p><p>Several limitations in this study warrant attention. Notably, the unfamiliarity of some tourists with governmental policies concerning CHSE was identified. This unfamiliarity is posited as a reason for EC not influencing environmentally friendly behaviour. A perception emerged suggesting the CHSE certificate primarily targets destination managers, with no direct bearing on tourists' environmentally responsible behaviours in Muslim-friendly venues.</p><p>For stakeholders, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that led to diminished tourist influx, an avenue for more nuanced research emerges. This research could focus on sustainable tourist behaviours, particularly as they relate to attributes of the destination based on trip experiences. It is imperative for managers of Muslim-friendly sites to closely evaluate the infrastructure, with emphasis on sanitation provisions. Complaints from tourists, particularly regarding sanitation, have been reported in several destinations. Moreover, the enhancement of facilities catering to religious observances is underscored.</p><p>The sampling scope of this study was geographically constrained, suggesting the potential for expanded and varied sampling in future inquiries. Additionally, forthcoming studies could consider delving into ESTB through the lens of gender disparities, given existing research suggesting women's heightened EC.</p>
