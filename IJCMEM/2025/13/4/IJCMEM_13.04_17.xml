      <abstract><p>This study investigates whole-body vibration (WBV) exposure in commuters on Iraqi roads. Measurement of vertical, lateral and longitudinal acceleration was obtained on urban arterials, rural two-lane roads and intercity highways using a low-cost measurement setup that incorporates an MPU6050 accelerometer and ESP32 microcontroller. Data was analyzed in accordance with ISO 2631-1, i.e. frequency-weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration, vibration dose values (VDV) or power spectral density analysis. The results show that vertical vibration (z-axis) predominates in WBV, with maximum energy occurring within the 3–6 Hz frequency range, which is known to correspond to the most responsive frequency range of the human body. The International Roughness Index (IRI), a measure of pavement texture, was highly associated with RMS (r = 0.66), with speed having an additional enhancing influence. Cars and SUVs on intercity highways stayed in “comfort” or “light comfort” zones, whereas heavy trucks on rural roads often encountered “uncomfortable” levels, with VDV up to 16.9 m/s$^{1.75}$. These results reveal a growing need for pavement rehabilitation of the Iraqi arterial and rural road networks, better enforcement of axle-load limits and the adoption of WBV monitoring in sensor-based management of road infrastructure. The research outcomes can serve as a useful reference for enhancing transport and occupational health protection policy making in Iraq.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a major concern for land vehicle occupants when they are subjected to abrupt events which induce travel irregularities; chronic exposure to the phenomenon may lead to discomfort, fatigue, musculoskeletal disorders and a decline in performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Vertical acceleration especially, and in particular within the 3–6 Hz frequency band, is found to be near human resonance frequencies responding with enhanced physiological and perceptual effects of vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. ISO 2631-1 describes established methods to assess WBV via root mean square (RMS) and vibration dose values (VDV)-weighted acceleration, as well as comfort boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>International WBV field investigations show that exposure levels and dominant frequency content vary markedly across regions due to differences in pavement maintenance, vehicle fleets, and operating conditions. Studies from Europe and North America often report WBV measurements on relatively well-maintained networks or controlled routes, with a strong emphasis on passenger vehicles and comfort-oriented indices. In contrast, studies conducted in developing regions more frequently document elevated WBV exposure for commercial vehicles operating on deteriorated pavements, where roughness-related excitation becomes more pronounced and cumulative measures such as VDV are particularly relevant. These cross-regional differences indicate that WBV should be interpreted as an outcome of combined road–vehicle interaction rather than infrastructure quality alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>Across literature, methodological choices also influence comparability. Some studies rely on seat-pad measurements with standardized ISO frequency weighting, while others adopt chassis-mounted sensors or alternative filtering schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], leading to differences in reported RMS and spectral peaks. Similarly, the magnitude of the reported association between roughness indicators (e.g., IRI) and WBV metrics varies with suspension design, axle configuration, and loading conditions, particularly for trucks. In this context, field data that jointly report WBV metrics together with road roughness and operating speed provide stronger evidence for comparing exposure patterns across vehicle classes and road categories.</p><p>The consequences of WBV include not only poor infrastructure maintenance but also increased cost of occupational health programs, besides reduced transport capacity and less efficient operation of transport-dependent sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. For professional drivers, in particular, prolonged exposure (&gt;8–10 h daily) to WBV on degraded road networks is a daily reality. This exposure leads to public health related issues and contributes to higher healthcare costs, workers' compensation claims and decreased operational efficiency of commercial transportation fleets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>A great deal of evidence is available globally that supports the relationship be-tween road roughness and WBV exposure. Múčka’s study, entitled evaluation of WBV and ride comfort in a passenger car [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], investigated vehicle vibration on different road categories at various speeds and discovered a strong relationship between pavement International Roughness Index (IRI), RMS acceleration and perceived ride comfort. The author suggested an IRI threshold definition of passenger car ride comfort and indicated that this threshold was affected by vehicle speed and road condition categories. More recently, De la Hoz-Torres and colleagues reported WBV exposure in heavy equipment vehicle drivers; examining both ISO 2631-1 and the later ISO 2631-5 standards, they concluded that cumulative “shock” exposure as well as posture can affect health risk profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, tests such as “Assessment of the effect of road roughness and vehicle speed on vibration comfort of school bus drivers' seats based on ISO 2631-1” (2024) showed how vehicle speed influence on WBV in combination with road roughness exposure extends beyond the predictions based upon noise alone. Metro or train drivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], for instance, are also found to be exposed to levels of WBV continuously present even on the most “resilient” track sections that exceed comfort and health guidelines at higher speeds or in poorer track conditions.</p><p>Recent progress in low-cost sensor technology, especially IoT-based accelerometer systems such as ESP32/MPU6050 platforms, opens up new possibilities for broad-based WBV monitoring at only a fraction of the costs of classical equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. These systems support real-time data generation, wireless communication and fleet-wide coverage across multiple road networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Contrary to typical vibration measurement systems that require investment running into thousands of dollars, these new generation technologies offer performance similar to that achieved in traffic signal systems, at less than \$50 a piece per instance (2database), enabling comprehensive monitoring programs within budgets accessible to developing countries and for research.</p><p>Research by the region’s scholars on Iraqi road conditions suggests widespread pavement distress. For example, the study “The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) method for evaluating pavement distresses of the roads in Iraq—A case study in Al-Nasiriyah city” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] found that most of the 13 roads surveyed in the Al-Hadharat Quarter scored in the “fair to poor” and “very poor” categories, with one road even rated “serious”, although none rated “failed” under PCI. While this provides a structural and visual distress assessment, these studies do not (in their current published form) measure WBV exposure or IRI and vibration metrics (e.g., ISO WBV) directly.</p><p>Although the WBV literature is rich in developed countries, where road infra-structure is good, this is not the case with many developing nations, particularly in the Middle East, which have similar climate challenges and are often unable to keep up with rapid urbanization, having only limited budgets to develop modern infrastructure that can serve as an input for vibration exposure data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The extreme desert environment, large diurnal temperature variations and high levels of commercial traffic loading result in distinct types of pavement distress, the extent of which may not be covered by the international body of literature. There is also the issue of older vehicle fleets, which characteristically have different types of suspensions, and all of this has a direct effect on vibration transmission patterns in such areas.</p><p>Given this background, several critical gaps exist in the existing knowledge base. First, there is only limited empirical WBV data in Iraq covering a comprehensive range of vehicle classes (cars, SUVs, medium and heavy trucks), let alone simultaneously measured IRI and speed data under real operational conditions. Second, very few studies in the local context process raw acceleration data through standardized ISO protocols (RMS, VDV, power spectral density (PSD)) to systematically assess comfort levels or health risk potential. Third, the local literature tends to emphasize pavement distress assessment in a static sense (visual surveys of cracks, patches, surface defects) rather than quantifying the dynamic effects of these distresses on vehicle occupants and operational efficiency.</p><p>This study sought to address these significant research gaps by collecting extensive WBV measurements on passenger and commercial vehicles driving on typical Iraqi road networks (urban arterials, rural two-lane roads, intercity highways) using a novel, low-cost sensor suite based on MPU6050 accelerometer technology along with ESP32 microcontrollers. Simultaneous tri-axial (vertical, lateral, longitudinal) acceleration in-formation was gathered together with vehicle velocity as well as GPS positions, whereas road roughness was characterized by means of standard IRI values. All vibration measures were also analyzed with regard to ISO 2631-1 (frequency weighted RMS acceleration, cumulative VDV, power spectral density analysis), in order to allow direct comparison of exposure across vehicle classes and road conditions.</p><p>The key objectives were to determine (1) comprehensive baseline WBV levels for Iraqi transportation conditions; (2) which specific combinations of road roughness, speed and vehicle class lead to discomfort or carry risks of health impact; (3) the relationship between measurable parameters of road quality and driver vibration exposure; and (4) evidence-based information necessary to develop recommendations for policy interventions involving prioritization of pavement maintenance, multi-tiered speed regulation strategies and occupational health protection requirements for professional drivers.</p><p>Unlike most previous WBV investigations that focus either on laboratory-based measurements or isolated vehicle classes, this study provides an integrated field-based assessment combining WBV metrics, IRI, vehicle speed, and GPS data under real Iraqi operating conditions. The novelty in the approach is based on the usage of the affordable Internet of Things-sensing system, ESP32/MPU6050, which satisfies ISO 2631-1 norms. Moreover, the work presents a comparative analysis among various vehicles and road types typical for countries with limited economic capacities, which have been inadequately covered in the contemporary WBV-related scientific literature.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>This study aimed to measure WBV in passenger and commercial vehicles plying on different classes of roads in Iraq, considering road roughness, vehicle speed and class of the vehicle. The applied methods are based on ISO 2631-1:1997, machines for seated operator (guideline for the measurement and evaluation of human exposure to vibration in seat fore-aft; optimized frequency ranges are suggested (0.5 Hz-80 Hz) concerning health, comfort and perception).</p>

            <title>2.1. Methodological workflow overview</title>
          
          <p>To align the experimental measurements with a computational analysis framework, the methodology was implemented as a structured pipeline from raw signals to standardized WBV indicators and statistical models. The workflow consists of four steps: (1) tri-axial acceleration sensing and synchronized speed/GPS acquisition during real driving runs; (2) preprocessing and signal conditioning including calibration, offset correction, band-pass filtering (0.5–80 Hz), and ISO 2631-1 frequency weighting; (3) computation of WBV metrics (frequency-weighted RMS, VDV, crest factor, and PSD-based features); and (4) statistical modeling to quantify the influence of IRI, vehicle speed, and vehicle class while accounting for repeated observations within the same vehicle and road segment.</p>

          <p>A custom sensing platform was built using the MPU6050 MEMS accelerometer/gyroscope module integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The MPU6050 supports three axes of acceleration (ax, ay, az) required for assessing WBV per ISO 2631-1 standards. Previous comparative studies (e.g., comparing MPU6050 with ADXL345) have validated its spectral fidelity up to around 80 Hz, provided that calibration, offset correction and appropriate filtering are applied. The collected signals pertain to the vertical (z), longitudinal (x) and lateral (y) axes.</p><p>Calibration involved placing the sensor in six known orientations (±1 g for each axis) to determine bias offset and scale factors. Zero-g calibration corrected bias, and gravity calibration verified scale factors over the operational ±8 g range, achieving measurement accuracy of ±2%. Temperature compensation was active to account for thermal drift during long measurements.</p>

          <p>Although the MPU6050 is not a reference-grade vibration instrument, previous studies have demonstrated that, after proper calibration and filtering, it provides reliable spectral characteristics for WBV assessment up to 80 Hz. In this study, emphasis is placed on relative comparisons across road and vehicle conditions rather than absolute metrological certification.</p>

          <p>Fifteen road segments were chosen in four regions (Baghdad, Babylon, Karbala, Najaf) representing three road types: urban arterials (5 segments, each 3–5 km), rural two-lane roads (6 segments, each 8–12 km) and intercity highways (4 segments, each 10–15 km). Examples of urban arterial roads in Baghdad are Palestine Street, Al-Sa’doun Street, Al-Jumhuriya Street, Al-Rashid Street and Mutanabbi Street; intercity highway examples included Highway 9 (connecting Karbala, Najaf, Al-Qādisiyyah) and Highway 8 (from Baghdad through Al Hillah towards Basrah). These were selected to cover the full range of pavement conditions—from fairly well-maintained highway stretches to severely deteriorated rural surfaces. Vehicles included passenger cars (n = 4), SUVs/pickups (n = 3), medium trucks (2–3 axles, n = 3) and heavy trucks (<inline-formula>

The ESP32 microcontroller transmitted triaxial acceleration data to the server using Wi-Fi, where the signals were stored in a structured database. A web ap-plication was created that includes an interactive dashboard, using which users can visualize the frequency-weighted RMS, VDV and PSD results of each individual test run. Results can also be exported to CSV/Excel for additional offline stats analysis.</p><p>The visualization interface incorporates time-domain and frequency spectra plots, comfort assessment zones (based on ISO 2631-1 criteria), allowing researchers or practitioners to assess the exposure to WBV levels under different road and vehicle conditions. This tool is a key instrument to guarantee completeness, accessibility and re-producibility of the experimental method used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

          <p>For parameter-level interpretation, IRI, speed, and vehicle class were treated as explanatory variables. IRI and speed were considered continuous predictors, while vehicle class and road category were treated as categorical predictors. To address the repeated-window structure within the same run, mixed-effects modeling was adopted, allowing vehicle identity and road segment to be modeled as random effects. This formulation reduces bias from within-run temporal dependence and supports inference on the relative contribution of pavement roughness and speed across vehicle categories.</p>

Roughness profile measurements revealed the poor quality of nearly all road infrastructure, with the state of rural two-lane sections being particularly poor (4.63 ± 0.82 m/km), far removed from internationally acceptable pavement standards. Urban arterials had moderately poor conditions (3.77 ± 0.71 m/km), whereas intercity highways exhibited marginally satisfactory performance (2.02 ± 0.54 m/km) that approached the international fair designation criteria.</p>

This frequency coincides with the first-order mode of vehicle body vibration and is the primary cause for passenger discomfort.</p><p>• Secondary resonance band (10–14 Hz): A higher frequency energy content related to wheel-axle assembly resonances is visualized in commercial truck measurements due to the larger unsprung mass and different suspension tuning characteristics compared with passenger cars.</p><p>Spectral analysis reveals that the most disturbing vibrations to human comfort are transmitted at frequencies corresponding to physiological maximum sensitivity, emphasizing the importance of the design effectiveness of suspension systems in terms of minimizing passengers’ exposure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the dominant frequency bands contributing to WBV under different vehicle and road conditions, highlighting the contrast between passenger vehicles and heavy trucks.</p><p>The detailed analysis using PSD reveals that about 45–60% of the overall vibration energy in the range of 3–6 Hz is contributed by heavy vehicles on rural roads, while for passenger cars on highways this contribution remains low (30–40%) in this region.

            <title>3.6. Iso 2631-1 comfort zone classification</title>
          
          <p>When applied to the measured vibration exposure data, the criteria for comfort assessment derived from ISO 2631-1 consistently revealed clear acceptability patterns in different vehicle–road combinations, as systematically categorised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>. Comfortable to reduced comfort: Passenger cars and SUVs operating on intercity highway infrastructure consistently achieved acceptable comfort levels. Their vibration exposure fell within or near the threshold described as being “Comfortable”. Uncomfortable to very Uncomfortable: Commercial trucks, particularly heavy vehicles operating on deteriorated rural road surfaces, generally exceeded acceptable comfort limits. Many of the environmental conditions found in such situations were Uncomfortable to near very Uncomfortable levels. These findings highlight the pressing need for specific infrastructure improvements on rural (non-urban) networks of paved highways and single-carriageway roads. The possibility of regulating commercial vehicle maximum loads when operating over very poor road surfaces could also be considered.</p>

          <p>Results suggest that IRI determines not only the instantaneous but also the cumulative vibration exposure metrics, while vehicle operating speed is recognised as a secondary, albeit significant factor. The high correlation between RMS and VDV acceleration is also a demonstration of the validity of both methods in evaluating the intensity of exposure to vibration (r = 0.98).</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>This study found that in all vehicles and road classes, vertical vibrations are the main contributor to WBV. This fits with the international literature, where the z-axis is mentioned as usually having the highest vibration amplitudes. The peaks of these frequencies (3–6 Hz) are particularly worrisome, as they are in the range in which the human body has its highest sensitivity. This makes it doubly dangerous not only for feeling vibrations but also possibly damaging health, especially when drivers face such long hours of work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. More serious drivers and travel agencies select a smoother road with fewer interruptions. This aligns with the findings of INIs from developing countries with similar climates and infrastructure problems, where pavement degradation is responsible for a large component of observed WBV levels. These urban or suburban streets are particularly unstable under the vehicle and possibly also under foot to walk on. Under some frameworks, they would even be categorised as “poor” roads, as we learn from study of Cao et al., which measured trucks’ vibrations on roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. With average IRI values exceeding 3.5 m/km on urban and rural roads, a substantial proportion of Iraq’s road network can be classified as “poor” or “very poor” when evaluated against international standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. Under such surface conditions, passenger vehicles frequently operate within the “reduced comfort” range, while heavy trucks are more likely to experience vibration levels corresponding to the “uncomfortable” category according to ISO 2631-1 classifications.</p><p>While strong correlations were observed between IRI and WBV metrics, these relationships should not be interpreted as strictly causal. Vehicle-specific factors such as suspension characteristics, axle configuration, seating systems, and loading conditions may also influence vibration transmission and act as confounding variables.</p><p>Vehicle class was also clearly a factor. Heavy trucks experienced the most intense vibrations because of their axle loads, types of suspension and interaction with surface roughness. This tendency was also observed for medium trucks, but not so much for cars and SUVs, which are lighter as their suspensions are more effective (especially on highways) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Speed was another factor that accentuated exposure; a rise from 70 km/h to 90 km/h increased RMS values by over 10%. Nevertheless, the far smoother ride of high-speed intercity roads largely compensated for these shortcomings, and most cars were still within tolerable comfort criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>].</p><p>When the results in ISO 2631-1 comfort zones were mapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], the following unequivocal pattern emerged: cars and SUVs on highways generally radio trucks on rural roads continuously to know road quality.</p><p>Iraq's professional drivers who spend long hours on the road use these streets as part of their daily routine, and it is known that this has an impact on their health. Extended exposure can lead to feeling worn out and bodily complaints and greatly reduce driver alertness during their duty hours. This aspect has also been emphasized in European occupational safety guidelines. A major reason for this situation is the wide-spread deterioration of pavement surfaces, with rural and urban highways having higher IRI values than metropolitan area roads. Prioritization of the reclamation process will be a necessary precondition to improvements in public wellbeing. On the vehicle side, better seating and underlaying suspension would at least afford drivers some protection from the pernicious influence of ground vibration. An inexpensive vibration monitor that uses sensors (such as the ESP32/MPU6050 platform employed in this study) may provide a worthwhile tool to incorporate vibration data gathering into de-vices, aiding decision-making for road maintenance planning.</p><p>It should be noted that the vibration measurements were obtained using a low-cost MEMS-based accelerometer rather than laboratory-grade instrumentation. Although this may compromise direct metrological comparison with certified systems, the manner by which the system was calibrated and validated against established standards supports the suitability of the system for comparative analysis in a field application for WBV measurement. This is reflective of the application, which is focused on measuring WBV trends in real-world road conditions in Iraq.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study presented a field-based assessment of WBV exposure in passenger and commercial vehicles operating on representative Iraqi road networks. Using ISO 2631-1-compliant frequency-weighted RMS acceleration, VDV, and power spectral density analysis, the results consistently showed that vertical vibration dominates WBV exposure, with the highest energy concentration occurring within the 3–6 Hz frequency band, corresponding to the range of greatest human sensitivity.</p><p>Among the investigated factors, pavement condition, expressed through the IRI, was identified as the primary determinant of vibration exposure levels, while vehicle operating speed acted as a secondary amplifying factor. Passenger cars and sport utility vehicles traveling on intercity highways generally remained within the “comfortable” to “reduced comfort” categories, whereas medium and heavy trucks operating on urban arterial and rural two-lane roads experienced substantially higher cumulative vibration exposure, frequently reaching the “uncomfortable” classification under ISO 2631-1 criteria.</p><p>Beyond the quantitative findings, this work demonstrates the feasibility of combining a low-cost IoT-based sensing platform with standardized WBV analysis to support large-scale, real-world vibration assessment. The proposed ESP32/MPU6050-based framework provides a practical and scalable approach for evaluating vehicle -road interaction effects in regions with limited access to high-end instrumentation, offering a robust experimental basis for infrastructure assessment and vibration-related engineering analysis.</p>
