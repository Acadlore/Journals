      <abstract><p>Predictable routing schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) often suffer from limited scalability, poor energy efficiency, and inadequate adaptability to dynamic network conditions. These limitations reduce the reliability of data transmission and shorten the network’s operational duration. To overcome these challenges, this study develops an adaptive routing framework driven by diverse machine learning (ML) techniques—including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and regression models—to intelligently select energy-efficient, congestion-aware, and secure routing paths. By continuously learning from network feedback on topology changes, node energy levels, and traffic load, the routing algorithm dynamically optimizes path selection. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional protocols in Packet Delivery Ratio, Energy Consumption, End-to-End Delay, Throughput, and Network Lifetime. Furthermore, the integration of anomaly detection mechanisms using behavioral analysis enhances security by identifying and isolating malicious nodes in real time. The results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of ML-driven routing for next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) and WSN infrastructures. Future work will explore real-world deployments and extended security features.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are unstructured networks made up of sensor nodes connected in an ad hoc fashion, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. WSNs are employed to keep an eye on the system, the surroundings, and the physical world. Many modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications rely on WSNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. They let you collect and look at data in a lot of different places, such smart cities, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. Several sensor nodes make up these networks. They operate together to see, evaluate, and transfer data to base stations or sinks that are all in one area. But it's really hard to create appropriate routing protocols for WSNs since the sensor nodes don't have a lot of power, the network topologies change, and the data has to be sent reliably.</p>

      <p>Traditional routing protocols are effective under some circumstances, but in general do not consider the energy constraints, scalability and flexibility required by WSNs. Sensor networks are such that, their topologies change frequently and their node's energy reserves vary dynamically. This implies that routing policies have to be dynamically adjusted to the particular situation of a network at a given point in time. In order to meet these needs, ML methods were proposed that would enable sensor nodes to learn from their environment and use data -driven routing decisions.</p><p>Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV), RPL and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) are all very common routing protocols that are suitable for most situations, but don’t work so well they are task specific to WSN. AODV has high control overhead and doesn’t scale well with the number of users, RPL load balances badly when the topology changes drastically, while DSR does not update itself as rapidly as network changes. Taken together, all of these issues drag the life and energy use of the networks down.</p><p>Routing approaches three subcategories under this approach in the past few years, a lot of machine learning-based routing schemes have been proposed that exploit neural networks, reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms (GA), fuzzy logic and some other heuristic in order to obtain optimal routes based on energy consumption. Congestion control and QoS or Quality of Service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], by accounting for local state information, e.g., remaining energy, buffer status and network load, these techniques enable nodes to estimate the best paths. This minimizes overhead message and extends the life of the network. It also provides the ability to employ adaptive routing algorithms which can learn and bypass nodes occupied or low in energy. This in turn speeds up the bullets and reduces latency/loss packets.</p><p>However, WSN routing involves some challenges while using ML such as the need for labeled training data to train the model, limited computational power of sensor nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] and a need for lightweight algorithms that balance accuracy with resource consumption. Nonetheless there are a number of ways machine learning can benefit the performance of WSNs. However, now researchers are more worrying about how to design routing protocols which should be scalable, efficient and reliable under the very large scale and highly non-uniform sensor networks.</p><p>Consequently, the objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to design an adaptive ML-driven routing protocol tailored for WSNs; (ii) use supervised, reinforcement and regression machine learning models in order improve routing decisions, thus leading to more efficient performance maximization; (iii) improve security by detecting anomalous behavior in the network and finally, and iv) confirm that performance improvements have been achieved over key metrics like data delivery reliability, delay, throughput and network lifetime through extensive simulation. We have designed a hybrid ML-based framework for routing, enabled continuous on-line learning for dynamic adaptation, and conducted rigorous benchmarking to show that we outperform state-of-the-art protocols. These are some of the main things that worked.</p>

      <title>2. Related work</title>
      <p>Routing in WSN is a critical issue, due to the limited energy resources, dynamic topology and need for reliable data delivery. Traditional routing mechanisms can rarely achieve the maximum use of energy consumption and network lifetime. To address these challenges, the emerging works resort to machine learning (ML) techniques towards enabling adaptive and energy efficient routing protocols as well as improving network performance.</p><p>Routing in wireless networks (WSNs as well as other LPLN) is very difficult because of dynamic topology, constrained energy, congestion and QoS requirement variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>Nayak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], also introduced the problems and challenges of using ML in WSNs routing. They argue that ML solutions (i.e., genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and deep learning) can take into account congestion explicitly, load balance in a functional manner and deliver traffic at the pace desired by modifying network conditions. The authors mention that ML methods avoid the drawbacks of static routing as they operate decision process in an online manner based on the instantaneous state of the network.</p><p>Ding et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] gave a broad visceral perspective of ML based energy efficient routing algorithms in WSNs. They show that reinforcement learning combined with neural networks and multi-agent decision can result in distributed collaborative routing decisions among sensor nodes, resulting in better energy consumption (lifetime) and quality of service metrics such as packet loss delay. These ML-based models take the local link status dependent parameters (i.e., remaining energy, packet error rate etc.) into account and discover the optimal dynamic routing alternatives dynamically. This prolongs the network since of life.</p><p>A study recently reported by Sattibabu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], they focused on energy-efficient routing protocols on more machine learning, and reminds that the primary job of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) routing is to try to save as much energy as possible. They push forward that ML-based mechanisms dynamically schedule routes by anticipating at which time nodes are running out of their energy and as an additional to when traffic becomes overloaded, in order to further extend the lifetime and robustness of the network.</p><p>In addition to energy efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], ML for security, geolocation and anomaly detection have been employed in WSNs.</p><p>Another recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] investigated the influence of ML-based routing protocols on data load overhead. It shows that supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods are pervious to environmental changes with less energy consumption and congestion.</p><p>Many classic routing algorithms aren’t smart or adaptable when it comes to these problems. Advanced information processing technologies, such as the ML based solution that nodes can learn from network states and deterministically prevent decision-making in routing combinations have been proposed. It improves energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio and delay minimize human intervention, network overhead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Issues encountered and solved by emphasizes ML methodologies embedded into routing protocols for WSNs such as energy save, conformation, congestion control or security are precisely elaborated. This one is for discussing and dissembling apps. The ML based adaptive routing method is grounded in the literature and necessary contributions.</p>

          <p>The limited processing power of sensor nodes, the difficulty in getting enough training data, the complexity of the models, and the possibility of higher communication overhead are all reasons why ML-based techniques can't be used in WSNs, even though they would be very useful. For these reasons, there has to be ongoing research on ML algorithms that are efficient, scalable, and lightweight, and that can learn within networks while being aware of the resources that are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>],  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p>

          <p>The method starts with putting out sensor nodes and setting up network settings. Each node then collects and shares important status information with its neighbors. After that, historical network data is combined and utilized to train different machine learning models, such as those that can forecast if packets will be delivered successfully, whether bandwidth is available, and whether there are any problems. After being trained, these models are used to help make routing choices in real time. This lets the system choose the best pathways, recover data on the fly, and keep an eye on security. The framework also has ways for the models to keep learning, so they can be updated with new data as it becomes available, and it makes sure that these changes are sent out quickly. To make the system even better, performance indicators like delivery ratio, latency, energy use, and security are always being watched. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> shows a complete process for utilizing machine learning to improve routing pathways in a sensor network.</p><p>Algorithmic</p><p><italic>Step 1</italic>: Initialize network and collect node states</p><p><italic>Step 2</italic>: Train ML models offline with historical data</p><p><italic>Step 3</italic>: while network operational do</p><p><inline-formula>

          <p>Using the collected network data, offline training of various ML models is performed. Supervised learning models like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (e.g., CatBoost) are trained to predict the probability of successful packet delivery for candidate routes. Reinforcement learning agents (Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks) learn optimal routing policies by maximizing cumulative rewards based on energy efficiency, delay, and throughput. Regression models such as Random Forest Regression predict future bandwidth availability to avoid congestion. Additionally, anomaly detection classifiers are trained to identify and isolate malicious or faulty nodes, enhancing security. This multi-model training strategy follows the distributed and modular ML framework recommended in recent research and simulation toolkits.</p>

            <title>4.3. Integration of ml models into routing protocol</title>
          
          <p>Once trained, the ML models are integrated into the routing protocol within the simulation environment. For example, in NS-3, MAT LAB or OMNeT++, the routing agent queries the ML models during route discovery and evaluation phases. Nodes broadcast their current states, and the source node identifies multiple candidate paths to the destination. Each candidate path is scored based on ML model predictions, including delivery success probability, predicted bandwidth, energy availability, congestion level, and security trust scores. The path with the highest composite score is selected for packet forwarding. This integration is supported by frameworks that allow external ML models (Python, R) to interact with network simulators.</p>

          <p>This adaptive data recovery cuts down on retransmissions and saves energy. At the same time, anomaly detection models keep an eye on how nodes behave all the time to find malicious actions or malfunctions. If a node is hacked, it is isolated to keep routing pathways safe. This dual emphasis on dependability and security is in line with recent improvements in ML-enhanced routing protocols that include adaptive error control and anomaly detection.</p>

            <title>4.5. Reinforcement learning and continuous adaptation</title>
          
          <p>Reinforcement learning agents implemented at nodes dynamically adapt their routing strategies on-line based on feedback carried by packets, i.e., success or failure, energy, latency and congestion features. This continuous learning allows the routing protocol to adapt to the evolving network conditions such as topology, traffic and node failures. To ensure that ML models remain accurate and responsive, they are retrained or fine-tuned on a periodic basis. As advocated in MAS and SDN-oriented architectures, distributed learning and control can help make systems more scalable and faster to adapt.</p>

          <p>Time dependent PDR comparison on ML-Based Routing and Traditional Routing in wireless network. Both approaches begin with the initial 50% PDR at time zero however the ML-Based Routing approach soon surpasses old school method, achieving a PDR of over 90% by 500 s. The old way, on the other hand, is resting at just about 80%. This indicates that ML-Based Routing critically improves data delivery over network operation. It is quickly responsive to the variations that can occur within a network and keeps a more harmonized and standard PDR over time, as compared with the previous routing protocol shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. This is strong evidence of the capacity for machine learning to enhance wireless network routing both in performance and reliability.</p>

          <p>The analysis of the evolution of energy consumption over time (Min) in ML-Based Routing and Traditional Routing for wireless. Both strategies begin with 0 usage of energy, but Traditional Routing drain energy much more quickly and at time stamp 500 seconds its energy reaches to 65 Joules. ML-Based Routing meanwhile consumes energy more slowly and efficiently, drawing only 38 Joules simultaneously. The significant improvements between them indicate that machine learning-based routing can route more efficaciously for energy saving, load balancing and lifetime extending, comparing with traditional routing protocols as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

            <title>4.9. End-to-end delay vs number of nodes</title>
          
          <p>The relationship between end-to-end delay and the number of nodes in a wireless network for both ML-Based Routing and Traditional Routing protocols. As the number of nodes increases from 20 to 100, the end-to-end delay rises for both approaches; however, the increase is significantly steeper for Traditional Routing, which reaches over 100 milliseconds at 100 nodes. In contrast, ML-Based Routing maintains a much lower delay throughout, only reaching about 70 milliseconds at the same scale. This demonstrates that ML-Based Routing is more efficient at managing network congestion and optimizing data paths, resulting in consistently lower delays even as the network grows larger, thereby offering better scalability and performance compared to traditional routing methods as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>.</p>

            <title>4.11. Throughput vs traffic load</title>
          
          <p>It compares the performance of ML-based routing and traditional routing in terms of throughput under varying traffic loads in a WSN. Throughput, measured in packets per second, consistently increases with higher traffic loads for both methods. However, ML-based routing (blue line) significantly outperforms traditional routing (red dashed line) across all traffic levels. For instance, at a traffic load of 50 packets/sec, ML-based routing achieves a throughput of about 32 packets/sec, while traditional routing only reaches around 22 packets/sec. This clearly demonstrates that ML-based routing is more efficient and capable of handling higher traffic volumes, resulting in improved data transmission performance as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>.</p><p>In comparison to conventional protocols, which only manage an 82% Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) after 500 seconds, ML-based routing reaches a whopping 94% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> shows that energy usage drops to 38 Joules from 65 Joules after 500 seconds. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref> shows that conventional approaches reach 110ms for 100 nodes, but ML-based routing keeps it to 70ms.

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In order to alleviate congestion, the suggested protocol employs supervised models to forecast the success of packet delivery, reinforcement learning agents (such as Deep Q-Networks) to optimize routes and dynamically update policies in response to changing traffic loads, and regression models to forecast the availability of bandwidth. By identifying and removing infected nodes, anomaly detection methods improve security and dependability even further. Adapting to changing network circumstances, these integrated ML techniques allow for the selection of routes that are energy efficient, dependable, and congestion aware. Further investigation into cross-layer optimization tactics, the creation of ultra-lightweight ML models for real-time deployment on sensor nodes with limited resources, and the incorporation of blockchain-based security mechanisms to enhance the reliability of WSN routing might be the subject of future study. Another factor that will push for the ML framework's practical acceptance is testing it in diverse and real-world settings.</p>
