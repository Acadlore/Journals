      <abstract><p>A Bayesian framework for estimating finger joint kinematics from spatially tracked hand landmarks was introduced in this study. Three-dimensional landmark data were constructed by augmenting image-based two-dimensional hand landmarks with calibrated depth information. A hierarchy of coordinate frames was established, beginning with the palm as the root and extending to child frames assigned to each finger, thereby encoding the natural kinematic dependencies of the hand. This hierarchical representation provides the structural foundation for Bayesian estimation. Finger joint parameters were estimated within a maximum likelihood framework that is robust to tracking noise and signal occlusions, which are common in practical hand-tracking scenarios. Unlike data-driven methods, the proposed approach does not rely on pre-collected training datasets but instead leverages the kinematic model and intrinsic physical constraints of the human hand. The estimation problem was formalized as a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN), through which joint parameters were inferred using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Robustness of the approach was qualitatively demonstrated through reconstructed graphical configurations that illustrate accurate recovery of finger postures under noisy conditions. This method provides a principled framework for hand motion reconstruction and establishes the foundation for future quantitative evaluations against benchmark datasets. The framework is expected to advance applications in human–computer interaction, prosthetic design, virtual reality (VR), and rehabilitation by enabling more reliable and anatomically consistent hand tracking.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Tracking and kinematic reconstruction of the human hand is an area of study with many potential applications such as robotics, gaming, or human-machine interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. For example, in clinical settings, such as rehabilitation centers, accurate tracking of hand or arm movements and their reconstruction in virtual environments enable detailed data collection and visualization, essential for healthcare providers monitoring recovery in patients like injured athletes or elderly individuals. Advanced tracking and reconstruction algorithms, combined with state-of-the-art hardware, can offer clinicians deeper insights into a patient’s motor abilities, providing a foundation for more accurate recovery assessments and aiding in early diagnosis of neurodegenerative conditions, including stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], Alzheimer’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Hand tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] and kinematic reconstruction still face many challenges due to the high-dimensional configuration space of the hand, the motion and appearance variations, the limitations of cameras, and the interference of cluttered environmental backgrounds.</p><p>Designing effective hand tracking and reconstruction systems presents unique challenges. The human hand’s complex structure, with its high degrees of freedom (DOF), makes it difficult to accurately track each joint and bone movement, as it involves estimating numerous parameters. Additional challenges arise from self-occlusions, where parts of the hand obscure others, and from the rapid speed of hand movements. These systems must also process substantial data volumes in real time, remaining robust in uncontrolled environments with noisy backgrounds and varying lighting conditions, all of which demand significant computational power and advanced algorithms.</p><p>Methods of hand tracking can be divided into two categories: appearance- and model-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Methods based on visual appearance try to find a mapping from the input data to the hand pose space by utilizing features such as edges. These methods are computationally less demanding since the learned tracking information is encoded for direct association without searching for the whole configuration space of the hand. However, these methods are limited by noise and partial occlusion in the input data and suffer from low accuracy and poor stability. Wang and Payandeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] used a Kalman filter to track human hands and leverage scale-invariant feature transform to extract features for hand posture recognition. Ge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] designed Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks (MVCNNs) to detect hand pose from a single depth image. Its main idea is projecting the depth image onto three orthogonal planes and using these projections to regress 2D joint heat maps that are further fused to predict 3D hand pose. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] presented MediaPipe Hands that can achieve real-time hand tracking using a neural network. It first used a palm detector to predict a bounding box and then used a landmark model to predict the hand skeleton. A feature extractor was trained with extensive hand data, and it can output the 2.5D position of 21 landmarks, the handedness, and the probability of hand presence.</p><p>Model-based methods try to fit a hand model to the input data. This process is always done through optimization or nearest neighborhood search. The optimization-based methods try to fine-tune the model parameters of the 3D hand until the model fits the input data well. The methods based on nearest neighborhood search try to find the most similar hand pose in a big pose database. Oikonomidis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] presented a tracking method that can predict the position, orientation, and full articulation of a hand by using a Kinect sensor. It is a typically model-based method as it formulates this as an optimization problem and seeks for model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between the hand model and hand observation. To solve this problem, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was used. Tagliasacchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] presented a robust Articulated Iterative Closest Point (articulated-ICP) to achieve real-time hand tracking using a single depth camera. The articulated registration algorithm can integrate data and regularization priors into a unified solver to enable robust tracking without restricting the freedom of motion. Qian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] presented a hand tracking system in real time on a desktop. This method follows a local optimization and initialization by a part detection framework. A simple hand model approximated by a set of spheres was used and a cost function measuring the distance between the model and a sparse point cloud was designed. Moreover, some works have tried to use multimodal sensors to capture the motion of human hands. Diaz and Payandeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] investigated the integration of a multimodal sensing system for exploring limits of vibrato tactile haptic feedback when interacting with 3D representations of objects.</p><p>Several studies have developed kinematic models for robotic hands, each designed to address specific functional needs and structural requirements. For example, Tarmizi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] presented a multi-fingered robotic hand model, developed using the Denavit-Hartenberg algorithm and Euler-Lagrange equations, to capture joint configurations and movement dynamics accurately. Similarly, Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] introduced an anthropomorphic robotic hand, the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Hand (KITECH-Hand), with a detailed kinematic analysis. This model uniquely focuses on the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the fingers, implementing a roll-pitch configuration to replace conventional yaw-pitch structures for improved mechanical functionality. Hand pose estimation methods leverage deep learning models, including diffusion-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. For instance, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] modeled hand pose forecasting as a reverse diffusion process, introducing a dual-diffusion mechanism that simultaneously captures local and global hand features using specialized global and local diffusion blocks. Cheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] proposed a diffusion-based model that de-noises hand pose predictions by integrating image and point cloud data. Joint-wise and local detail conditions were introduced to recover precise key-point positions. Additionally, Ye et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] focused on hand-object interactions, designing a diffusion network that models the conditional distribution of object geometries based on hand configurations captured from video sequences.</p><p>As a more recent comparative literature review, Mangalam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] targeted realistic and immersive hand-object interaction in virtual reality (VR). Current limitations in VR systems were identified, such as unnatural post-collision behavior and ineffective grasping, and a multi-pronged solution across hand modeling, contact dynamics, and grasp release was proposed. The focus was on enhancing realism through physical simulation, neuroscientific insights, and mesh-based modeling, rather than explicit kinematic parameter estimation which is the main focus of this current study. While both works aim to improve hand representation in digital environments, the contributions of this current study emphasize kinematic inference and model estimation from data, whereas the referenced study addresses interaction realism and dynamic behavior in virtual environments. Joseph Isaac et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] presented a deep learning-based approach that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on large, annotated datasets (HANDS2017 and MSRA) to directly predict 3D hand poses. Its novelty lies in enforcing anatomical correctness within the network architecture itself, avoiding the need for post-processing filters. The model ensures that predicted poses lie within the biomechanical constraints of the human hand, and even corrects errors found in the “ground truth” annotations by creating new datasets (AEF-HANDS2017 and AEF-MSRA). In contrast, this current study offers a data-efficient, model-driven solution that avoids training entirely, while the Semi-Supervised Cross-Correlation Convolutional Neural Network (SSC-CNN) offers a data-intensive, learning-based solution that corrects anatomical inconsistencies through architectural constraints. The former emphasizes hierarchical kinematic reasoning and interpretability, whereas the latter prioritizes learning anatomical validity within a predictive neural framework. Pavlakos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] presented a fully data-driven, transformer-based method for recovering full 3D hand meshes from monocular images. It emphasizes scale and learning capacity, combining multiple annotated datasets and utilizing a large Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. It excels in generalizing to in-the-wild conditions, as shown by performance gains on a new benchmark dataset (HInt) with real-world images and 2D keypoint annotations.</p><p>While this current study and the study by Pavlakos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] both aim to reconstruct the 3D structure of the hand, the former emphasizes interpretable, physically grounded kinematic estimation without the need for training data, whereas the latter focuses on high-capacity, large-scale learning to recover dense hand meshes with superior generalization. The former prioritizes model structure and estimation robustness, while the latter advances end-to-end learning performance and dataset scalability. Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] introduced a deep learning framework that bridges graph neural networks and state-space modeling for improved 3D hand pose and shape estimation from single red–green–blue (RGB) images. It addresses limitations in existing transformer-based models by proposing a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block, which more efficiently captures spatial relationships between joints using significantly fewer tokens. Combined with a global-local fusion module, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. In relation to this current study which offers a structured, estimation-driven method rooted in kinematic modeling and physical constraints, the study by Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] delivers a data-intensive, learning-driven solution that leverages graph-guided neural representations for superior accuracy. The former prioritizes robustness and model transparency, whereas the latter emphasizes scalability and predictive performance through architectural innovation.</p><p>Rezaei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] presented a deep learning-based method tailored for depth image inputs. Its key innovation lies in decomposing 3D pose estimation into two stages: predicting 2D joint locations (UV space) and separately estimating depth using dual attention maps. This decomposition isolates the complexity of depth prediction, improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, it introduces a novel appearance-based data augmentation technique for depth images. This current study emphasizes explicit kinematic modeling, interpretability, and estimation robustness without training, while the study by Rezaei et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] focuses on architectural innovations and data augmentation to enhance learning-based prediction accuracy. The former is designed for model-driven reconstruction under minimal data assumptions using measured red–green–blue–depth (RGB-D) data, while the latter advances data-driven depth image analysis for applications.</p><p>Despite these advancements, current models are designed for robotic applications and are not readily adaptable to map real hand landmark point clouds into kinematic representations for accurate remote control and graphical reconstruction. In this study, hand poses were estimated using a kinematic model that explicitly enforces motion constraints and ensures natural hand configurations. The proposed approach presents a 3D objective function using a Bayesian tracking framework for enhancing robustness to occlusion and missing data by providing a well-constrained solution space that accurately reflects hand biomechanics. Additionally, deep learning-based hand pose reconstruction methods typically rely on implicit learning of hand structure constraints within the network, which makes them sensitive to unseen hand poses and limits their capacity to generalize across the full range of hand motion. In this study, a hierarchical kinematic model tailored for hand tracking applications was proposed. The proposed model integrates measured data with a multi-layered kinematic structure, enabling precise hand tracking and reconstruction that aligns well with real hand movements in 3D space.</p>

      <title>2. Landmark-based hand kinematic construction</title>
      <p>This section presents a short overview of kinematic modeling and construction of the hand based on tracking landmarks.</p><p>Kinematic modeling involves creating a mathematical framework to represent the motion of a physical structure, such as the human hand. This representation can be used to determine the relative joint variables that describe the position and orientation of various interconnected segments. Such information can further be utilized to control a physical robotic hand or its virtual counterpart, or as part of a graphical model for visualizing the physical system.</p><p>In contrast to physical robots or wearable devices - where each moving joint is equipped with sensors for precise motion tracking - hand movement tracking using ambient sensing modalities such as RGB-D sensors provides only the coordinates of selected landmarks relative to the sensor frame. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows typical hand landmarks defined by MediaPipe, measured using calibrated RGB-D sensing (e.g., an Intel RealSense RGB-D sensor, D345-SDK), with coordinates defined in the sensor’s coordinate system.</p><p>The goal of constructing a kinematic model of the hand is to establish a hierarchical coordinate system that can be used to compute finger joint angles based on these spatial landmark measurements through the inverse kinematic solutions. On the other hand, the forward solution refers to the case where the information regarding finger joint angles is available and it is required to estimate for the spatial location of landmarks. In this study, the kinematic model of the hand was constructed from 21 spatial landmark measurements (a point cloud with respect to the sensor frame), consisting of one at the root (the wrist) and 20 distributed across the phalanges of the five fingers. In the following kinematic model construction, each link was assigned a corresponding local frame, allowing the description of the position and rotational angles of each link.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">A world coordinate frame {W} is defined to locate the position and orientation of<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif"> the hand, including its palm and connecting fingers. This coordinate frame is collocated with the RGB-D sensor frame. The rotational angle of each finger joint can be described by defining local (or relative) coordinate frames within the hand. In this context, a wrist frame {0} is defined, which is affixed to the wrist, moves with <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">the hand, and is specified relative to the world frame. It also serves as a local coordinate frame with respect to which all other hand coordinates are defined.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif"> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, the <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> at the fingertips.</p><p>Each MCP joint, or finger root joint, possesses two DOF, enabling it to flex and extend (bend up and down) as well as abduct and adduct (move side to side). When the root of a finger is fixed, and the finger is bent up and down, the PIP and DIP joints each exhibit one DOF. Consequently, the workspace (the area the fingertip can reach) of a finger is a 2D plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>a). Each of the five fingers can thus be modeled as a kinematic chain comprising three links connected by three revolute joints, with parallel rotation axes. The unit vectors <inline-formula>

A systematic approach was introduced for resolving these parameters through transformations between adjacent coordinate frames. The input parameters are 21 hand landmarks provided by the MediaPipe model, along with depth data captured by an RGB-D sensor. These represent the position parameters of the origin of each local frame <inline-formula>

      <p>The stages of grasping, as captured using RGB-D and MediaPipe, are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. This figure provides example case studies showing how the hand approaches, contacts, partially encloses, and ultimately fully grasps the object. These stages are depicted from two different measurement perspectives: a frontal view (top row) and a side view (bottom row). It is important to note that during all these phases, the positions and orientations of certain landmarks are more difficult to track and kinematically reconstruct accurately due to several factors. Occlusions - caused by parts of the hand being hidden behind the object or by overlapping fingers - can result in undetectable measures in depth values. Additionally, sensor data may be noisy or incomplete, particularly for joints involved in fine-grained grasping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], such as the PIP and DIP joints. Missing or noisy measurements of these joints pose significant challenges for accurately reconstructing the full hand posture, as even small inaccuracies can lead to incorrect reconstruction of the grasp.</p><p>In the context of kinematic hand modeling for grasping objects, accurately estimating parameters such as joint angles for graphical reconstruction requires capturing the complex dependencies between adjacent joints. These natural dependencies are due to the structure of the open-kinematic chain representing each finger which is attached to the palm. In this construction, the movement of one joint influences the movement of others in the process of forming a stable grasp. To effectively model these relationships and account for uncertainties in sensor data, a Bayesian network framework  was adopted. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model (PGM) that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this framework, each node corresponds to a joint or landmark, and the edges capture the dependencies between joints, making it particularly well-suited for tracking a grasping hand where resolving the values of certain joints is more prone to occlusion.</p><p>This section extends this concept to a Gaussian Bayesian Network (GBN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], which is also well-suited for continuous domains such as joint positions and angles. The GBN framework allows us to model the uncertainty in sensor data through Gaussian noise while capturing the hierarchical dependencies between joints in the kinematic structure and solutions of the hand. In the GBN framework, each joint position is represented as a continuous random variable, and the joint probability density function is modeled using a Gaussian distribution. The core strength of the Bayesian network lies in its ability to model these conditional dependencies between joints. For instance, given the known position of the wrist, the positions of the MCP joints are conditionally dependent on the position and orientation of the wrist. Similarly, the PIP and DIP joints depend on the state of their parent joints. This hierarchical relationship allows the network to propagate information efficiently through the kinematic model and solutions, making it possible to estimate joint angles even when some data points are missing or noisy.</p>

          <p>When measured landmark information is available, a forward kinematic solution (or direct kinematics) is applied to estimate and perform kinematic transformations for reconstructing hand joint positions and orientations based on the measured landmark parameters. In cases where detected landmarks are missing or occluded by objects or other parts of the hand, forward estimation alone may yield inaccurate joint angle parameters, resulting in failed graphical reconstructions in Unity. To address such scenarios, an inverse kinematic solution was applied to resolve and identify an optimal set of hand kinematic model parameters. This method corrects and updates the joint angles by refining the forward kinematic model to better fit the available, incomplete data. By leveraging the forward kinematic solution-based on detected hand joint positions and previously estimated joint angles-iterative estimation enables the accurate reconstruction of hand movements and object grasping poses under various conditions. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>, significant outliers typically have unusually large deviations from the other landmarks. A straightforward yet effective method for outlier detection is to compute the median of the 3D coordinates across all 21 landmarks and then measure the distance of each landmark from this median. If the distance exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.2 meters), the landmark is classified as an outlier.</p>

</inline-formula>, leading to a probability of 1. However, sensor noise is inevitable, meaning the measured data will always deviate from the ideal kinematic positions. For instance, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>, the depth values for the third and the fingertip landmarks of the index finger (joints 7 and 8) are particularly inaccurate. Therefore, the distance computed distance <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> obtained from the sensor. Since there are 21 landmark measurements (including landmark 0) defined by MediaPipe and obtained through the Intel D435 RGB-D depth sensor, this study aims to estimate how well the optimal sets of parameters for the hand kinematic model describe the hand pose during movement. To accomplish this, this study seeks to maximize the overall likelihood, which is the product of the individual probabilities for each observation. Mathematically, this can be represented as the joint likelihood of all 21 landmarks in each frame:</p>

      <title>4. Qualitative experimental study</title>
      <p>This section presents sample qualitative results for two sets of experiments involving tracking and graphical reconstruction sequences of the hand movements toward a cup for grasping while the measured observations were conducted from two different perspectives. These experiments are designed to test the robustness of the proposed estimation approach under varying conditions, including various cases of occlusions. The tracking and reconstruction were initialized using the kinematic model parameters in order to calculate the initial joint angles and position of the virtual hand model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>). Initially, the parameters (<inline-formula>

This study presents the results of hand tracking and reconstruction during the initial approach phase, followed by two intermediate pre-grasping poses, and finally the full grasping phase. A second grasping task case study, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, involves the hand moving along a diagonal trajectory from the upper left to the lower right with respect to the sensor. In this case, tracking data is collected from a side view, culminating in a full grasp of the cup handle. Using a similar analysis to the previous experiment, the performance of the estimation method was evaluated along this alternative trajectory and viewpoint, with a focus on the model’s adaptability to changes in perspective and motion path.</p>

          <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>, five landmarks associated with the joints are detected as missing, namely the DIP joint of the middle finger and all four joints of the ring finger. Additionally, the index finger’s PIP, DIP, and tip joints are not detected as outliers, due to their near-identical values. This observation can further demonstrate the need for using the kinematic model constraints within the proposed estimation techniques of this study to distinguish individual joints accurately under occlusion conditions. By constraining finger lengths and estimating missing values, a realistic representation of finger poses can be restored despite the occlusion-induced data loss, thereby maintaining consistency with the hand’s natural structure.</p><p>Furthermore, it can be seen that in the absence of the root joint for the ring finger, determining the hand palm as a planar reference becomes infeasible. This lack of a reference plane disrupts the kinematic calculations, leading to failures in most parts of the model due to missing values and instances of self-occlusion. In these scenarios, multiple points converge spatially, resulting in nearly indistinguishable joint angles, which hinders accurate angle calculations. As seen in the unity reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>c), these limitations manifest as an unnatural hand orientation, with almost all fingers appearing unnaturally compressed together. This distortion occurs because the lack of critical reference points and reliable spatial separation between joints leaves the kinematic model with insufficient information to accurately resolve individual finger positions and orientations. Consequently, the constraints typically applied to enforce anatomical structure are ineffective, causing fingers to “collapse” into each other.</p>

</inline-formula>. The optimization proceeds by evaluating the objective function (or "loss") and adjusting the model parameters using gradient-based methods. To analyze the performance of the proposed estimation algorithm, the objective function's decreasing trend is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>. By examining the error reduction trend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>, substantial decreases in error across key iterations (from iteration 0 to 1,1 to 5, and 5 to the final iteration at 36 ) can be observed, with reductions of 0.35, 0.07, and 0.002, respectively. These reductions indicate clear convergence toward minimizing error as the algorithm iteratively adjusts parameters, refining the estimated poses to better align with the measured data. Through iterative refinement, the optimization process successfully restores anatomical coherence to the hand model by adjusting joint orientations and positions, effectively compensating for the missing data. This outcome underscores the robustness of the estimation method in dealing with occlusions and highlights the value of iterative optimization for achieving realistic motion representation. The estimated 3D spatial coordinates of the missing landmarks, along with a comparative analysis of Unity reconstructions with and without the application of the estimation process, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>c, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>d.</p>

            <title>4.2. $\gamma$ instant of the side measure: case 2</title>
          
          <p>This instant of the hand-grasping phase is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>. This instant would be the last phase of the grasping hand approaching the cup handle while the tracking information is collected from the side using the RGB-D sensor. In this fully grasping case, all four fingers rotate backward in the direct graphical reconstruction, with each joint-MCP, PIP, DIP, and tip-approaching a 90-degree rotation. This scenario presents a challenging case of object occlusion, as the MCP joints of all four fingers are obscured by the cup handle and the other finger segments. Additionally, the measured data from the depth sensor becomes nearly collinear, which deviates from the true finger configuration due to the imposed joint angle constraints limiting rotations between 0 and 90 degrees. It can be seen that despite the dominant presence of ambiguities in the landmark measured which resulted in the infeasible joint angles, the proposed method offers a robust joint angle estimation. By incorporating prior knowledge, kinematic constraints, and initial joint angle measures, it can compensate for the collinearity and occlusion-induced errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref>). The model's optimization process handles the unnatural alignment suggested by the collinear data and adjusts the estimated joint positions accordingly, preserving the realistic articulation of the fingers. This allows us to maintain a coherent representation of the hand pose, even under the presence of object occlusion, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>d and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_14">Figure 14</xref>.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The proposed estimation method demonstrates considerable robustness in handling occlusions, noise, and incomplete data during hand pose tracking and grasping tasks. By leveraging a Bayesian network model, a structured framework was established that captures the hierarchical dependencies among hand joints, allowing the system to effectively compensate for missing depth values and occluded joints. This approach, combined with kinematic constraints, enables accurate hand pose estimation even in complex scenarios (e.g., occlusions caused by object grasping) where sensor data may become unreliable or collinear. The integration of prior knowledge and structural constraints enables the model to produce reasonable approximations despite challenging data conditions. A key limitation of the current method lies in its computational cost. While the Bayesian network is effective at handling noise and missing data, it depends on an accurate understanding of the kinematic structure and inter-joint dependencies to function optimally. The reliance on MLE and iterative optimization techniques introduces computational overhead, which poses challenges for real-time applications that demand rapid processing.</p><p>In the current setup, object detection and MediaPipe hand tracking operate efficiently, with execution times of approximately 10 ms and 60 ms per frame, respectively. This efficiency is largely attributed to the extensive training data and optimized model architecture underlying MediaPipe, enabling robust and fast performance. In contrast, the MLE-based parameter estimation is significantly more time-consuming, requiring between 1.5 to 6 seconds per frame. This delay arises from the complexity of aligning point cloud data with the kinematic model, as well as the iterative optimization required to estimate joint positions accurately. Each step involves fine-tuning parameters to satisfy hierarchical constraints while fitting the observed data, making the process computationally intensive. Furthermore, the RGB-D sensor used in the proposed setup has a frame rate of approximately 15 frames per second (FPS), underscoring the mismatch between data acquisition speed and the processing speed of the proposed estimation pipeline.</p><p>To address these limitations, several strategies can be explored to enhance the computational efficiency of the estimation framework. These include the adoption of faster optimization techniques, such as diffusion models, which manage uncertainty through probabilistic distributions and have shown promising performance in 3D generative tasks, including unseen point cloud generation and missing part completion. Incorporating prior knowledge through deep learning methods, such as selective optimization guided by learned affordances (e.g., Affordance Diffusion), may accelerate estimation by filtering out inaccurate landmark detections. In addition, hardware acceleration strategies (e.g., edge computing) can enable parallel computations across distributed nodes, further improving efficiency. Together, these advancements present a promising pathway for overcoming current computational bottlenecks and achieving real-time hand pose estimation, thereby increasing the system’s practicality and enabling further comparative studies with existing methods. </p>
