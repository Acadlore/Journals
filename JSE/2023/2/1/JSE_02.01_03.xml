      <abstract>Helical microtubes are commonly used in micro-electronic cooling techniques and micro-heat exchangers because of the creation of secondary flows, which leads to greater temperature and velocity gradients. It is of great significance to further improve the overall efficiency of the helical microtubes so as to diminish energy consumption. This experimental work mainly focuses on exergy analysis of air flow through adiabatic helical microtubes with circle, triangle, square, and pentagon geometries with circular cross section. The temperature rises due to viscose dispassion and pressure drops have been measured for all adiabatic helical coils in the laminar flow range. To identify irreversibility of flow, rate of air flow, coil diameter and Dean number are varied to investigate their influences on the entropy generation. Also, the second law of thermodynamics was applied to recognize exergy efficiencies and to determine true magnitudes of exergy losses. Results indicate that entropy generation increases by increasing the flow rate and the coil diameters in all geometries, however, the exergy efficiency decreases. By considering geometry, in constant flow rate and identical coil diameter, the highest entropy generation can be approximately observed in the triangles, squares, pentagons, and circles, respectively. Moreover, the proportions of theoretical exergy losses to actual exergy losses have been computed for all geometries in order to probe the viscous heating effects and it is found that the predicted exergy losses distinguish substantially from measured amounts due to viscose dispassion.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In recent years, helical microtubes have had a significant role in improving thermal performance in industrial applications, such as micro shell and tube heat exchangers due to the excellent processing and anti-fouling performance. Owing to the extensive use of these heat exchange equipment, any slight performance improvement of them will yield substantial economic benefits. Theses microtubes generate greater temperature and velocity gradients compared to macro tubes by the creation of secondary flows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Since any change in the flow gives rise to the larger impact, second law analysis of thermodynamic is indispensable. The exergy loss is a measure to evaluate the thermodynamic efficiency of the process, in the other words, the lower exergy loss means the higher thermodynamic efficiency and the lower required energy, which can be achieved by debilitating irreversibility through friction, mixing, chemical reactions, heat transfer, and etc. In the present study, exergy losses are investigated in helical microtubes with novel geometries under adiabatic conditions to discover the effects of viscous dissipation.</p><p>The concept of irreversibility in a straight pipe with a circular cross-section firstly was surveyed by Bejan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Ozalp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] computationally detected the effects of temperature difference, Prandtl number and Eckert number on exergy loss and entropy generation in a micropipe, and he discovered that for Poiseuille flow the local exergy loss greatly differs from the entropy generation due to the presence of pressure drop. He also solved the Navier-Stokes and energy equations for various Reynolds numbers and surface roughness at constant heat fluxes and discussed heat transfer-frictional characteristics on entropy generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Dizaji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] performed a comprehensive study of experimental exergy analysis for tube-in-tube helically coiled heat exchangers. Results indicated that the enhancement of hot or cold-water flow rates, hot water inlet temperature, and coil diameter increase the amount of exergy loss. Pourhedayat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] proposed a new empirical correlation to predict the dimensionless exergy loss in helical tubes. Moradi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] studied thermal and entropic characteristics of upward air-water two-phase flow in a vertical helical tube. Their results indicate maximum increment of 35% and 26% for heat transfer coefficient and entropy generation, respectively. Ko and Ting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] presented the thermodynamic optimization of fully developed laminar convection in a helical coil. The optimal helical coil design from the perspective of the thermodynamic second law was introduced in their investigation. Parlak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] probed the Second law analysis of water flow through smooth microtubes under adiabatic conditions and their results disclosed that the flow characteristics in the smooth microtubes distinguish substantially from the conventional theory for flow in the larger tubes with respect to viscous heating dissipation. They also conducted exergy analysis of laminar fluid flow in stainless steel microtubes and it was observed that as Re increases, measured exergy losses were significantly higher than that of the predicted values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. In summarizing the above literature review, the number of studies related to micro helical tubes is so limited. On the other hand, curved geometries of triangle, square, and pentagon with circular cross section have not been examined. Accordingly, this motivates this investigation to assess the rate of entropy generation, exergy loss, and exergy efficiency of helical microtubes with circle, triangle, square, and pentagon geometries with circular cross section under adiabatic conditions to fill the gap between friction factor and the geometrical optimization study of the helical microtubes based on the second law of thermodynamics and provides strong evidence that the exergy destruction minimization principle is applicable in the laminar flow regime of helical microtubes. In this study, the effects of flow rate, coil diameter and Dean number on entropy generation were investigated. It should be hinted that on account of conducting experiments under adiabatic conditions, the effect of heat transfer was disregarded.</p><p>A general view of the experimental set-up is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. As seen, the supplied air flow by a compressor at 20℃ in five distinct flow rates which were determined as 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 l/min was entered to a helical microtube. Two valves were used to control the air flow rate, first one was assembled at the main path and the second one was provided to control the bypass flow. It is remarkable that the air flow rate produced by air compressor was more than the maximum measurable rate of air-Rota-meter; so that the bypass flow was provided to a precise control of air flow rate. The measurement of air flow rate, temperature, and the pressure drop at both the entrance and the exit cross-section of the microtubes were carried out by air-Rota-meter, K-type thermocouple (accuracy ±0.5℃ and resolution 0.1℃), and digital manometer (accuracy and resolution 1 mmHg), respectively. Four distinguishing geometries, such as circle, triangle, square, and pentagon with various coil diameters were located in the adiabatic test section, which was isolated by applying glass wool. To minimize the heat loss to the environment, an air gap of 2-3 mm was considered between the test tube and the isolating material. Furthermore, in a particular temperature-controlled test room, where temperature fluctuation was periodically checked by means of a portable temperature measurement device, the least heat loss from the tube surface to the surrounding air was achieved by minimizing temperature differences between the tube surface and the surrounding air to 0.5℃. The inspected microtubes are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

          <p>Exergy efficiency illustrates the how far the efficiency of a conversion process is from its theoretical maximum. The universal exergy efficiency enables a thermodynamic comparison of alternative systems in cases where no product can be defined. Universal exergy efficiency is defined as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>];</p>

      <p>An exergy analysis was performed for air flow through the aforementioned geometries. The entropy generation rate in the flow was calculated by Eq. (14). According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, entropy generation rate increases as flow rate and coil diameter increase in each geometry. It is obvious that the tube length not only intensifies pressure drop, it can be deduced from Eq. (16), but also affects the exergy loss as expected, without revealing any unusual behavior as Parlak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] revealed. </p>

      <p>As disclosed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> at constant flow rates, higher entropy generations occur both in larger coil diameters and in lower Dean numbers. In the analysis based on geometry, in constant flow rate and assuming identical Dean number, almost the highest entropy generations take place in triangles, squares, pentagons, and circles respectively. The numbers on the diagram indicate the orientation of expanding coil diameters for each of geometries where 1 represents the smallest diameter.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In a nutshell in this paper, an experimental investigation is executed to examine the entropy generation, exergy loss, and exergy efficiency of air flow through the adiabatic helical microtubes with unprecedented geometries. The effects of air flow rate, coil diameter, and Dean number are inspected. The exergy loss is a measure to evaluate the thermodynamic efficiency of the process, in the other words, the lower exergy loss means the higher thermodynamic efficiency and the lower required energy, which can be achieved by debilitating irreversibility through friction. In the present study, exergy losses are investigated in helical microtubes with novel geometries under adiabatic conditions to discover the effects of viscous dissipation. Moreover, the entropy generation analysis is conducted to evaluate the inefficiency in the studied geometries. This study is expected to provide a comprehensive performance overview of the evaluated configurations. The conclusions of this inquiry can be recapitulated as:</p><p>• By analyzing experimental data, it was observed that entropy generation increases by increasing the flow rate in all geometries.</p><p>• In all studied geometries of helical microtubes, the entropy generation ascended as the coil diameters become larger in all geometries.</p><p>• By considering geometry, in constant flow rate and identical coil diameter, the highest entropy generation can be approximately observed in the triangles, squares, pentagons, and circles, respectively because of greater minor losses of pressure caused by bend angle in geometries.</p><p>• In a constant flow rate with increasing coil diameter, which is associated with the decrease in Dean number, it can be observed that the entropy generation is increased.</p><p>• The exergy efficiency decreases as flow rate and coil diameter increase in all geometries.</p><p>• The proportions of theoretical exergy losses to actual exergy losses have been computed for all geometries in order to probe the viscous heating effects. It is found that viscous heating effect should be accounted for air flow applications in the assumed microtubes. In other words, the viscous heating effect on entropy generation in the laminar flow regime can't be ignored.</p><p>• The results of comparing the measured and predicted values for exergy losses prove the experimental success of providing adiabatic conditions. </p>
