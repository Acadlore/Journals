      <title>2. Factors affecting cloud security</title>
      <p>The advent of cloud computing has generated apprehensions regarding security, encompassing both strategic and tactical aspects. In order to address these concerns, security procedures have been implemented across different cloud service and deployment types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. These cloud security measures include governance-related security measures that comprise strategic and policy-related factors within the cloud environment. Conversely, the operational domains focus on resolving tactical security concerns and implementing them inside the architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. These measures are intended to tackle the interconnected variables that affect cloud security. The choice of cloud service model by an organisation has a substantial impact on the potential security vulnerabilities. Within the context of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the cloud provider assumes responsibility for managing the infrastructure, while the client is accountable for all other aspects, such as the operating system, applications, and data. This architecture offers significant versatility, but it also places a considerable share of the security accountability on the consumer. Platform as a Service (PaaS) involves the supplier taking care of the operating system and middleware, while the customer is responsible for the applications and data. In the context of Software as a Service (SaaS), the supplier assumes responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the software, while the customer primarily functions as a user of the product. The primary role of the user is to effectively handle data management and access control. This helps to minimise the range of potential security concerns, although it may not necessarily mitigate their severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the selection of the cloud provider plays a crucial role in the process of adopting cloud technology. Cloud providers may employ different security policies and practices. For instance, certain entities may employ powerful encryption methods to protect data during transmission and storage, offer comprehensive identity and access management (IAM) solutions, or provide extensive logging and monitoring features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The provider's transparency regarding its security infrastructure and adherence to security standards and certifications, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), is crucial. Regardless of the level of security in a cloud provider's infrastructure, security in the cloud is governed by a shared responsibility model, where both the provider and the client have distinct security responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Governance and risk management, encompassing legal matters, compliance and audit management, and information governance, are essential components of cloud security. To achieve secure and efficient utilisation of cloud services, organisations must adequately handle these elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Cloud computing brings new aspects to the governance and control of organisational risks. Organisations are required to maintain governance accountability, even while using third-party services, due to the shared responsibility paradigm in cloud computing. The choice of service and deployment models, such as SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, greatly influences governance structures and risk management techniques. Managing public cloud environments can be challenging due to the limited control over assets. Therefore, it is crucial to actively manage relationships with cloud providers, conduct rigorous contract reviews, and implement responsive governance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Effective governance and risk management are facilitated by tools and procedures such as supplier assessments, compliance reporting, and risk controls. Conducting regular assessments, audits, and ensuring that risk needs are aligned with assets are essential in reducing possible threats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Organisations should so carefully plan and execute strategies to successfully and safely manage the complexities of cloud computing. </p><p>Organisations have many legal considerations when adopting cloud computing, including information protection, disclosure of security breaches, regulatory duties, privacy concerns, and compliance with international laws. These problems emphasise the crucial significance of adhering to the law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Cloud providers and customers face distinct issues due to the differing data protection and privacy legislation in various nations. Hence, organisations must remain updated on the changing rules and regulations that are pertinent to their cloud operations, which can require the assistance of legal advice. Contracts and privacy warnings play a crucial role in safeguarding data, as cloud clients are frequently bound by contractual responsibilities to safeguard personal information and guarantee its security. Although data processing has been outsourced, the responsibility for ensuring data protection lies with the data custodian. Prior to engaging into contracts with cloud providers, organisations should perform comprehensive due diligence, taking into account aspects such as the nature of the service, the provider's reputation, the level of support offered, and the location of the data centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Managing electronic discovery (e-discovery) is an additional obstacle in cloud computing, requiring meticulous preparation and collaboration between customers and suppliers. To effectively navigate the legal aspects of cloud computing, one must possess a thorough comprehension of pertinent frameworks, precise contract administration, and strong data protection protocols. </p><p>Ensuring compliance and effectively handling audits are essential for maintaining the security posture of cloud systems. Transitioning to cloud computing presents organisations with the task of adhering to many regulations in several countries and modifying their operations to suit virtual environments. Given that current legislation frequently overlook virtualized or cloud settings, it is imperative for stakeholders, such as consumers, auditors, and providers, to comprehend the regulatory consequences associated with utilising particular cloud services. Important factors to consider include comprehending the capabilities of service providers in meeting regulatory requirements, the impact of provider audits and certifications on the extent of the customer's own audits, and the management of compliance over an extended period of time. The notion of compliance inheritance, whereby the certified services offered by the supplier relieve the consumer of certain auditing obligations, is crucial. However, customers are still accountable for ensuring that their applications, which are built on top of the provider's services, meet all the necessary requirements. Managing audits include comprehending compliance duties, assessing provider attestations, generating compliance artefacts, and monitoring providers' compliance statuses. Compliance, audit, and assurance should be ongoing procedures, rather than isolated activities. Providers should effectively convey audit findings, certifications, and restrictions to aid customers, while also upholding certifications and promptly informing customers of any changes in status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. The transition to cloud-based architectures necessitates new approaches to protecting data, given characteristics such as scalability, shared resource usage, and simplified management.</p><p>Cloud computing presents novel obstacles for information governance. The presence of multiple tenants sharing infrastructure in a multitenancy setup gives rise to security and governance concerns. In cloud computing, there is a need for a clear understanding of data ownership and custodianship due to the shared security responsibility. This is particularly important as cloud providers take on the role of additional custodians in the governance paradigm. The involvement of third parties and changes in jurisdiction make compliance, regulations, and privacy policies more intricate.</p><p>Cloud computing enables the distribution of data storage across several places, which gives rise to difficulties over adherence to locational and jurisdictional regulations. It is crucial to synchronise information management and security strategies with these duties. The data security lifecycle, which includes the stages of production, storage, usage, sharing, archiving, and destruction, offers a valuable structure for adopting security controls at every stage of the data's existence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. </p><p>Various suggestions arise for tackling these governance obstacles. Prior to migrating to the cloud, organisations should define their governance requirements, taking into account their legal duties, contractual agreements, and corporate policies. Effective management of data in the cloud necessitates the implementation of information governance rules and practices. This entails establishing a strong partnership and cooperation between organisations and cloud service providers. Utilising the data security lifecycle model is advantageous for directing data handling procedures. Lastly, transitioning to the cloud offers a chance to evaluate and enhance information architectures, enabling organisations to tackle any fragmented practices and reorganise existing information management strategies. In summary, it is crucial to have efficient information governance in the cloud to handle potential dangers and safeguard confidential data. This requires the development of innovative approaches to navigate the intricate nature of cloud computing. </p><p>Various operational domains in cloud security encompass the management plane, business continuity, infrastructure security, virtualization and containers, incident response and remediation, application security, data security and encryption, identity, entitlement, and access management, security as a service, and related technologies. The overall cloud security posture is directly influenced by internal IT and security practices.</p><p>The management plane, serving as the interface that connects and configures the cloud infrastructure, requires robust security measures to restrict access and guarantee the security of the data centre. Centralising the management plane offers advantages such as enhanced visibility and control over resources. However, it also presents notable security and configuration difficulties. To secure the management plane, it is essential to implement strong IAM rules, utilise multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enforce the principle of least privilege access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. </p><p>Ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) is of utmost importance in the realm of cloud computing. An effective BC/DR strategy must encompass measures to guarantee uninterrupted operations and swift recovery inside the cloud service provider. It should also address the management of provider outages and explore possibilities for seamless migration across other providers or platforms. </p><p>Cloud computing security is dependent on various essential elements. The Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) concept serves as a fundamental element that enhances infrastructure security by dynamically allocating network access according to device and user authentication. Another crucial factor is incident response and management, which necessitates appropriate procedures for problem identification, communication, and resolution, considering the intricacies brought about by cloud computing. Application security is a crucial aspect that needs careful consideration while creating or transitioning applications to the cloud, taking into account various cloud platforms like SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. Ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information in the cloud requires the use of data security measures, encryption techniques, and robust key management systems. The field of security as a service investigates the potential advantages and factors to consider when delegating security functions to specialised third-party providers. Finally, it is crucial to thoroughly examine and comprehend the security ramifications of incorporating interconnected technologies like big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile computing into cloud systems.</p><p>As stated in the study by Gui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], the distribution of funds is a crucial determinant of the adoption of security measures in cloud computing. Implementing and sustaining strong security measures in cloud environments sometimes necessitates significant financial commitments. Organisations must take into account costs associated with infrastructure, staff, training, and adherence to regulations. Infrastructure costs encompass expenses related to licencing or subscribing to security solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The results presented in the study by Gui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] indicate that organisations should allocate resources towards hiring proficient security experts or partnering with managed security service providers (MSSPs) to develop, execute, and oversee the security architecture. Aside from personnel expenses, budget allocation should also consider provisions for training programmes and certifications to guarantee that security workers are well-informed about the most current cloud security protocols and technology. Compliance and auditing expenses are necessary in order to adhere to regulatory standards and fulfil industry-specific criteria. Hence, organisations must meticulously manage their budget allocation to guarantee efficient cloud security, taking into account their security prerequisites and risk tolerance.</p><p>Within the realm of cloud security, the time it takes to bring a product to market is a significant consideration that must be carefully weighed against the demands of ensuring security. As stated in the study by Mozumder et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, hasty deployments lacking sufficient security safeguards can subject organisations to substantial risks and vulnerabilities. Hence, it is imperative to integrate security evaluations at the outset of the deployment process. Organisations can detect and resolve potential vulnerabilities by undertaking comprehensive security assessments, which involve architecture reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. In order to accelerate the deployment process, it is possible to utilise automation and DevSecOps approaches. By incorporating infrastructure as code (IaC) and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, security controls can be integrated at the beginning of the development cycle, guaranteeing that security safeguards are not compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. In addition, organisations have the opportunity to utilise pre-configured security solutions such as cloud-native security services or managed security services. These solutions are specifically designed to expedite implementation and allow organisations to benefit from the knowledge and skills of specialised security providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Striking a balance between expeditious product release and implementing sufficient security measures is of utmost importance, and organisations ought to develop unambiguous security protocols.</p>

      <p>The mediating factors that can impact the interaction between independent variables and the dependent variable are as follows: the size of the organisation, the sector in which it operates, the type of cloud deployment model used (public, private, hybrid), the geographic location, the size of the Information Technology (IT) staff, the organization's experience with cloud services, the type of data handled, and the cloud service model employed (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). </p><p>After the development of this framework, specific assumptions were formulated. Each independent variable was suggested to have an impact on the dependent variable, presumably through the involvement of the identified mediating variables. The variable being measured in this study is the cloud security posture of an enterprise. </p><p>The questionnaire was partitioned into four primary sections, each fulfilling a unique objective:</p><p>Part A: Individual profile. This component was designed to gather information about the respondent's history, ensuring that the feedback received was based on their personal experience and knowledge. The participant's level of knowledge and experience in cloud computing, as well as their position within the organisation, would give background information for the following answers.</p><p>Part B: Organisational profile. The questions in this area were created to assess the organization's size, industry, cloud service models, and other specific information. Understanding industry-specific or size-related trends and variations in cloud security postures requires key knowledge.</p><p>Part C: Evaluation of cloud security posture in enterprises: This section specifically assessed the respondents' perceptions regarding their organization's level of preparedness in terms of cloud security. The Likert scale-based questions were designed to evaluate the participants' confidence levels on their organization's cloud defences.</p><p>Part D: Factors. This component of the questionnaire had explicit statements that were directly related to the hypotheses. Participants were once again asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement using a Likert scale. Each question presented here corresponds to a specific hypothesis, and the collected data directly contributes to the validation of these hypotheses.</p><p>The questionnaire was designed to strike a balance between obtaining targeted, hypothesis-driven information and collecting more comprehensive insights regarding cloud security in the contemporary corporate setting. It was imperative to ensure that the questions were unambiguous, impartial, and focused on capturing authentic perceptions of cloud security postures and procedures.</p><p>To summarise, the research methodology employed a clearly defined conceptual framework and adhered to a rigorous, literature-supported approach. This approach ensured that the derivation of hypotheses and the development of the questionnaire closely aligned with the research objectives, ultimately aiming for precision and credibility in the study's findings.</p><p>An online survey platform was employed to gather data, which included a combination of closed and open-ended questions. This strategy offers significant benefits in terms of both time and cost efficiency when compared to alternative investigation methods.</p><p>Data on the proposed security and privacy variables affecting the adoption of cloud computing was collected using a cross-sectional approach. Data collection was conducted at a certain moment, with the goal of minimising errors by implementing suitable procedural techniques. The unit of analysis consists of a diverse variety of enterprises from several business sectors that have either implemented cloud computing or are interested in adopting it.</p><p>In order to ascertain the eligibility of the responders, screening questions were implemented with the purpose of evaluating their understanding and enthusiasm towards cloud computing. This was done to exclude those who did not fulfil the requirements for recruitment. The initial inquiry ascertained whether the responder was affiliated with an organisation, while the subsequent question verified their involvement in IT-related decision-making or the acquisition of new IT applications. The third question assessed the respondent's level of acquaintance with cloud computing.</p><p>The researcher's discretion was used to determine the suitability and representativeness of the respondents included in the research. A sample is a carefully selected fraction of the population used for a particular study. </p><p>This study specifically examines organisations that have implemented cloud computing. The research seeks to analyse the security and privacy concerns that impact the use of cloud computing services by businesses. Hence, the intended participants for this quantitative study were individuals who possess knowledge and experience in deploying or functioning within a cloud environment, and are actively engaged in IT-related decision-making or the acquisition of new IT applications. Hence, the chosen sample method is convenience sampling. Networking for professional purposes LinkedIn was utilised to conduct a targeted search and establish contact with appropriate respondents.</p><p>This study employed purposive sampling to specifically select individuals who possess a deep understanding and extensive experience in cloud computing. Subjective judgement was used to include relevant examples in the sample technique, taking into account practical issues. It is crucial to recognise that the presence of self-selection bias can impact the acquired findings, hence constraining their applicability to the overall community. Nevertheless, this research offers vital insights into the intricacies of the acquired sample, instead of striving for generalizability. The main objective of this exploratory research is to investigate the proposed phenomena and its correlation with the provided hypotheses using an appropriate sample size.</p><p>The primary objective of this pilot study is to offer preliminary insights into the diverse aspects that impact cloud security. The pilot study also functions as an initial investigation into comprehending the dynamics of cloud security and the array of components that impact company cloud security. The analysis involves verifying the hypotheses that were formulated based on the literature review. The initial regression analysis, which encompasses tables and graphs, investigates each hypothesis by examining the correlations between the variables and the overall level of cloud security. These findings lay the foundation for future, more thorough investigations. Hence, the findings will be analysed within the framework and constraints of a pilot study. </p><p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> below demonstrates that the respondents possess a minimum level of familiarity or proficiency with cloud computing principles. The responders encompass a range of roles, including managerial and technical positions, and possess a combination of decision-making responsibilities. This diversity guarantees a more equitable viewpoint when making decisions on cloud security.</p>

      <p>These discrepancies highlight how diverse professional backgrounds influence the comprehension of cloud security. Participants, ranging from IT managers to cloud architects, have varying perceptions about cloud security that are influenced by their respective roles. For example, a cloud architect may prioritise addressing technical vulnerabilities, whereas an IT manager may place greater emphasis on enforcing organisational policies.</p><p>The organisational profile encompasses the internal and external factors that influence an organisation. These components also serve as mediators within the conceptual framework. The pilot sample consisted of individuals from several sectors, with a slight majority coming from the IT/technology and finance sectors. The bulk of organisations were of considerable size, employing over 500 individuals, and a significant proportion have been utilising cloud services for a duration of 4 to 6 years. </p><p>This study has compiled comprehensive profiles of the respondent organisations in different nations, which will remain anonymous in scholarly publications. The specific information comprises the size of the organisation, the type of industry it belongs to, the model of cloud deployment, the geographical location, the cloud service models utilised, the size of the internal IT team, the level of experience the organisation has with cloud technology, and the nature of the data kept in the cloud. </p><p>The comprehensive organisational profiles reveal diverse cloud adoption patterns that are driven by criteria such as the size of the organisation, industry, and geographical location. Despite the limited size of the pilot sample, a comprehensive correlation analysis was not possible. However, these initial insights provide insight into the many strategies that companies are employing to navigate the cloud landscape, which are influenced by their unique requirements, past experiences, and limitations. Several significant findings from the pilot test, which could only be determined by a large-scale survey, are:</p><p>Â· Cloud service models: The majority of organisations, regardless of their size or industry, have embraced at least one significant cloud service model. This highlights the growing utilisation of cloud services in contemporary company operations.</p><p>Â· Data type in cloud: Financial data is a prevalent data category stored on the cloud, particularly among finance-focused organisations. This suggests a high level of confidence in cloud services' ability to manage confidential financial information.</p><p>Additionally, it is possible to evaluate the influence of mediating variables on Hypothesis 6, namely the impact of organisational context and features (such as size and industry) and demographics, in moderating the correlations outlined in Hypotheses 1-5. This will demonstrate the significant influence of the larger organisational environment on its cloud security dynamics. </p>

          <p>The majority of businesses assessed their cloud security posture as "secure," suggesting a prevailing sense of vulnerability since most respondents did not choose the option of being "highly secure." This issue is further emphasised when the participants acknowledged previous instances of security breaches and potential risks to their data kept in the cloud. Nevertheless, the data also indicates that these businesses are highly proactive in addressing issues. The cloud's ability to protect against cyber threats, detect and respond to incidents, and the efficiency of its security policies are all rated as "secure to strongly agree." This underscores the importance that businesses have placed on having strong and reliable cloud security measures. </p>

            <title>6.1. Cloud security posture</title>
          
          <p>The cloud security posture of an organisation reflects its preparedness to counter both external and internal threats. This stance exemplifies the all-encompassing defence strategy that the company has adopted to address difficulties related to cloud computing (Hussain, Fatima, Saeed, Raza, &amp;amp;amp; Shahzad, 2017). Although the majority of organisations in the survey exhibited a significant level of attentiveness to cloud security, the extent and scope of their readiness differed depending on the specific characteristics that each organisation had emphasised. From the literature review, two clear tactics were identified: protection, which involves preventing threats, and resistance, which involves addressing active threats. The empirical study found that sectors such as IT and Finance, which were prominent in the pilot sample, demonstrated robust protective and resistance capabilities. However, there were slightly concerning findings regarding the future-proofing of cloud security posture, indicating a potential vulnerability. This underscores the significance of continuously upgrading cloud security strategies and measures to ensure ongoing security and preparedness for the future. </p><p>Furthermore, it may be inferred that while certain organisations fully include cloud security best practices, others merely adhere to fundamental legal obligations, suggesting varying degrees of dedication to security. This preliminary investigation reveals a wide range of cloud security methods, highlighting the necessity for a more comprehensive research investigation. </p>
