      <abstract><p>It could be argued that the competitive resources possessed by organisations today are similar. One of the most important factors that differentiates businesses, provides a competitive advantage, and enables them to stay one step ahead of their competitors is human capital. Organisations' ability to act in line with their mission, vision, and goals depends on the effective and efficient management of this capital. Selecting the right personnel is one of the most important stages in managing human resources effectively and efficiently. If the selected personnel do not perform as expected, it can indeed harm the organisation. The purpose of this study is therefore to identify the selection criteria prioritised by human resources managers in a call centre, a hospital, a bank, a public economic enterprise, and two companies operating in an organized industrial zone in personnel selection. The criteria prioritised in personnel selection were first collected during initial interviews with relevant managers to create a pool of criteria. Ten of these criteria were then presented to the managers in a second interview, and they were asked to rank them in order of importance. Data obtained from each manager was analysed using the IMF-SWARA method. According to the results, the most important criterion for managers was “Position and competency alignment (PCA)”, while the least important criterion was “solving problems promptly and effectively (SPP)”. These findings demonstrate that managers prioritise compatibility between the qualities of the job and those of the personnel. It is believed that these results can guide managers in organisations operating in the relevant sector, as well as individuals considering working in this sector.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In today’s world, the impact of globalization has made economic, technological, and cultural boundaries between countries increasingly permeable, affecting the competitive conditions for businesses. In this new order, the quality of a company’s human resources and its ability to manage these resources effectively have become important factors in achieving sustainable competitive advantage and distinguishing itself from its competitors to gain a strong position in the market. Indeed, in intense competitive conditions, the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the human resources possessed have become more decisive in achieving business goals than traditional resources such as location, raw materials, and technology.</p><p>The core activities of human resource management are defined as predicting future human resource needs, conducting workforce planning, performing job analysis and job design, finding, selecting, retaining, and improving the performance of personnel suited to the job’s characteristics, all within the framework of the organization’s mission, vision, and strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. One of the most important stages of these activities is the personnel selection process.</p><p>Personnel selection is critical to the efficiency and sustainable success of businesses because the selected personnel must be trained, nurtured, and developed in order to implement the defined strategies and achieve the objectives. Failure to select the right candidate can lead to inefficient use of resources allocated for training, development, and improvement, as well as time and financial losses, incompatibility, inefficiency, loss of competitive advantage, or falling behind competitors. Furthermore, it may force businesses to re-enter the recruitment process, thereby increasing costs related to hiring, training, salaries, additional payments, and termination. On the other hand, selecting the right personnel can facilitate the achievement of business goals, increase the success of the human resources department, and ensure that the selected candidate is successful in their role. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the skills of candidates in line with the basic competencies required for each position and to identify the most suitable candidates.</p><p>The personnel selection process can also be explained by the Person-Organization Fit Theory. According to this theory, there must be a fit between the organization’s demands, values, norms, and goals, and the individual’s characteristics, values, goals, knowledge, skills, abilities, experience, effort, and commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. If this fit is not achieved, it can be said that organizational resources are not being used effectively and efficiently enough.</p><p>Personnel selection has become a critical managerial decision of increasing strategic importance for businesses. Decision-making in this process, defined as choosing among various alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], plays a vital role in identifying the most suitable candidate. Decision-makers should prefer analytical and fast-acting methods to prevent waste of resources and time when identifying candidates to be hired. Within the specified framework, this study addresses personnel selection as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. Using this method, the personnel selection process of a call center serving over 9,000 employees across 8 locations, a hospital, a regional bank office, a public economic enterprise, and two companies operating in an organized industrial zone has been examined in detail.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>This research employed the IMF-SWARA method to derive the weights of the criteria. The procedure of this method is delineated below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>Step 1: After determining all selection criteria, rank them in descending order based on their predicted level of importance. As a result, the most important criterion should come first, and the least important should come last.</p><p>Step 2: During the process of establishing the relative significance ratio of each criterion, beginning with the second criterion, the importance level is assessed for all criteria in comparison to the preceding criterion. This assessment is conducted utilizing the linguistic terminology outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. Therefore, for each criterion, the relative importance ratio (<inline-formula>

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>One of the fundamental objectives of human resources management is to determine job analysis, job description, and job requirements. Through job analysis, the characteristics, requirements, and responsibilities of the job are identified, and the job description is created. In line with the job description, the workforce with characteristics suitable for the job requirements is determined. When the job’s characteristics match the workforce’s, employee performance, task fulfillment, teamwork, openness to development, compliance with organizational culture, and organizational commitment can increase.</p><p>Analysis of data obtained from managers in call centers, healthcare, banking, public economic enterprises, and manufacturing organizations shows that the most important criterion in personnel selection is “position and competency alignment.” According to these results, it is crucial to have the right workforce in the right place at the right time. When there is a match between the job requirements and the employees’ qualifications, employees can perform their duties better, and organizations can achieve their goals more quickly. If the wrong workforce that does not possess the required qualifications is preferred, this can result in numerous costs for organizations. Inefficiencies, low performance, increased employee turnover, time loss, disruptions in the production process, and increased error rates are among the main costs.</p><p>The incorrect use of the workforce also brings many problems for employees. If the job requirements and the qualifications of the employees do not match, employees will not have the opportunity to use their various skills. Not using the skills that employees possess or having fewer skills than the job requires can negatively affect their motivation, job satisfaction, and performance.</p><p>The second criterion that relevant managers consider most important is “completing assigned tasks thoroughly and not interfering with others’ responsibilities”. In order for employees to perform their assigned tasks effectively and efficiently, it must be clearly stated what tasks they will perform, to whom they will be accountable, and what their authority and responsibility areas are. Employees must act within the specified limits. When these specified boundaries are crossed or when others’ areas of responsibility are interfered with, chaos and conflicts become inevitable. Chaos within organizations and conflicts among employees can lead to decreased productivity, loss of labor, deviation from organizational goals, or sabotage. Therefore, the criterion of “completing assigned tasks thoroughly and not interfering with others’ responsibilities” may be considered the second most important criterion.</p><p>Some managers (Manager-6) also considered “adaptation to teamwork” to be the most important criterion. Today, organizations emphasize teamwork to gain a competitive advantage and quickly adapt to environmental changes. Harmony among team members and their high ability to work together are crucial for businesses to quickly adapt to their environment, respond promptly to customer demands, and achieve organizational goals. Employees who do not act in accordance with team performance and are not harmonious with their teammates can negatively impact organizations.</p><p>Another criterion that managers (Manager-2) value is “honesty”. Employees’ knowledge and approach towards service recipients are important in achieving organizational goals and managerial success. Employees’ dishonesty towards their managers, withholding information from them, or deliberately providing incomplete information can lead to managers making mistakes and organizations suffering damage. Furthermore, employees’ dishonesty towards service recipients can undermine trust and negatively affect the image of organizations.</p><p>Managers rated “strong communication skills and openness to feedback” and “solving problems promptly and effectively” as the least important criteria. Managers may have thought that strong communication skills and openness to feedback would not be necessary when there was a match between employee qualities and job requirements, and when employees did not interfere in each other’s areas. However, managers may have thought that when employees lack the necessary qualifications for their positions and cause conflict by interfering in others’ areas of responsibility, communication skills become meaningless; employees may become problem creators rather than problem solvers. All these situations may have led managers to view these criteria as less important.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Based on data collected from managers of two companies operating in call centers, hospitals, banks, public economic enterprises, and organized industrial zones, it was found that the most important criterion in personnel selection is “position and competency alignment”. In addition, some managers considered honesty (Manager-2) and teamwork compatibility (Manager-6) to be the most important criteria in personnel selection. In contrast, “solving problems promptly and effectively” was identified as the least important criterion. However, there was no consensus among managers on the least important criterion. Organizational culture fit (Manager-1), experience (Manager-2 and 3), organizational commitment (Manager-5), and openness to development (Manager-6) were among the criteria considered least important by managers. This difference may be due to managers being selected from different sectors. This situation also constitutes a limitation of the study. As a result, managers prioritize the following in personnel selection: position and competency alignment, completing the given tasks accurately and not interfering with the responsibilities of others, experience, adaptation to teamwork, honesty, openness to development, organizational culture fit, organizational commitment, strong communication skills and openness to feedback, and solving problems quickly and effectively.</p>
