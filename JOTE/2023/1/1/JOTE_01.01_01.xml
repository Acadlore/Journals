      <abstract><p>Within the evolving landscape of modern business, a proficient logistics sector stands paramount in fostering regional and global competitive edges. A country's logistics performance, gauged aptly, can influence not just the business outcomes of individual enterprises but also shape the nation's holistic logistics efficacy. This study delves into an examination of logistics standards in European Union (EU) countries, viewed through the lens of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), as reported by the World Bank. The primary focus is on the LPI data for 2023, with a subsequent exploration of the EU’s performance trajectory from 2007 to 2018. The findings illuminate that specific EU countries consistently uphold superior logistics proficiency, while striving for advancements. Beyond these front runners, many EU countries manifest commendable logistics outcomes, positioning themselves favorably on the global stage.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>A robust logistics performance is pivotal in boosting international trade volumes. Conversely, countries grappling with underdeveloped logistics infrastructures and subpar logistics services often find themselves marginalized in the international supply chain. Such scenarios hinder their economic momentum, leading to potential stagnation. Therefore, it becomes imperative for nations to consistently monitor, measure, and compare their logistics performance against global counterparts to decipher avenues for improvement in logistics and associated services. Prior to formulating strategies or instigating policy changes – be it infrastructure augmentation or regulatory modifications – a thorough assessment of a country's logistics standing is necessary. This ensures that decisions are based on well-defined parameters reflecting logistics quality. A notable instrument for this evaluation is the LPI, which offers a comprehensive snapshot of global logistics conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Mešić et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Miškić et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Kabak et al. (2018)</xref> underscore the significance for nations to grasp their logistics standing to craft policies enhancing trade and transportation engagements with global partners. For policymakers, insights into logistics performance serve as a comparative tool to discern their nation's relative positioning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Arvis et al. (2023)</xref> emphasize the escalating importance of understanding logistics performance, especially in light of significant global market shifts post-2018. The ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted global supply chains, further accentuate this need. To navigate these tumultuous waters, nations must adopt an introspective lens towards their logistics performance while also surveying the global landscape. The LPI sheds light on disparities across countries, particularly in areas like customs protocols, logistics expenses, and infrastructure caliber for terrestrial and maritime conveyance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Martí et al., 2014</xref>). Enhancements in LPI facets can bolster a nation's trade dynamics. These aspects of the LPI are gaining traction, especially in regions like Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe, where logistics becomes a linchpin for international competitiveness. As emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Jhawar et al. (2017)</xref>, for nations to carve a logistics edge, it's vital to evaluate and fine tune their existing logistics framework. This involves discerning which subsystems demand optimization, evolution, introduction, or outright elimination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Ojala &amp;amp; Çelebi (2015)</xref>, meanwhile, advocate for comprehensive logistics analyses to augment freight transport efficiency and pinpoint synergistic partnerships with nations to bridge logistical gaps.</p><p>Strategically, countries endeavor to elevate their LPI score, thereby climbing the global rankings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Ulutaş &amp;amp; Karaköy, 2019</xref>). Such strategic pursuits often hinge on pinpointing LPI warranting keen focus. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Sénquiz-Díaz (2021)</xref>, for nations where mere transportation doesn't suffice, a well-orchestrated logistics strategy can become a game changer, enabling them to tap into global production networks. This, in turn, enhances their policy frameworks, subsequently elevating their populace's quality of life. The surge in global trade, coupled with production consolidation and economic fluctuations, underscores the salience of freight and logistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Andrejić &amp;amp; Kilibarda, 2014</xref>). A nation's economic vitality is invariably intertwined with its logistics acumen. Superior logistics performance paves the way for seamless access to international markets, amplifying trade volumes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Burity (2021)</xref> posits, logistics efficiency is integral to shaping customer experiences, influencing loyalty, retention, and overall satisfaction.</p><p>The methodological approach adopted in this study is segmented into four phases. The inaugural phase, grounded in literature reviews, underscores the essence of measuring and monitoring national logistics performance. As the narrative pivots to evaluate the LPI results of EU countries over the years, the requisite data was collated in the subsequent phase. The third phase delves into the 2023 LPI results for the EU, paving the way for the final phase where a retrospective comparison of the EU's LPI performance across preceding reports unfolds.</p>

      <title>2. Analysis of the 2023 lpi results of eu countries</title>
      <p>The LPI serves as a metric to evaluate the quality of a country's logistics environment. Data for the index are procured by the World Bank, primarily through surveys undertaken by global logistics operators. These operators, in turn, offer insights into logistics across the countries in which they operate. The 2023 edition of the LPI has provided results for 139 countries, ranking them according to six criteria: customs, infrastructure, ease of arranging shipments, logistics service quality, consignment tracking and tracing capabilities, and timeliness.</p><p>From the 2023 LPI report presented by the World Bank, a detailed assessment of the scores of EU member countries was conducted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> the rankings of the EU countries for the aforementioned year, whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> depicts the LPI scores they garnered.</p><p>In the 2023 World Bank LPI report, Finland emerges as the top-performing EU country, securing the second rank globally with an LPI score of 4.2. Following Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany the second best-ranked countries in the European Union with an LPI score of 4.1. The third place is taken by Austria, Belgium and Sweden (rank 7), and their LPI score is 4.0. The fourth place belongs to France and Spain (rank 13), which have a slightly lower value of the LPI score compared to the previous countries (3.9), while the fifth place is taken by Greece and Italy (rank 19, value of the LPI score is 3.7). The Czech Republic, Croatia, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia are in the penultimate place (rank 43), with an LPI score of 3.3, while Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary and Romania have the worst results of all EU countries (rank 51, LPI score is 3.2), therefore, they also represent the last-ranked countries of this group. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> below provides visual depictions of scores aligned with individual LPI criteria.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Logistics undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in the economic fabric of nations globally. The ripple effect of an efficient logistics system is palpable across economic and financial sectors. Consequently, nations are keen on enhancing their logistics prowess. This drive for improvement demands rigorous scrutiny, benchmarking, and refinement, a task capably addressefd by the LPI.</p><p>Upon analyzing the LPI metrics, which encapsulates both aggregate scores and individual parameter readings, one discerns that the EU stands tall on the global logistics landscape. For instance, the 2007 report spotlighted four EU countries — the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Austria — among the world's top five. Fast forward to 2010, and the EU's representation remained robust with Germany leading the charts and Sweden, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium making it to the top ten. This trend of EU dominance persisted through 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, with Germany often clinching the top spot.</p><p>By 2023, the dynamics saw a slight shift. Germany slid to the fourth position, yet the EU's presence in the top echelons remained unyielding with Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium featuring prominently.</p><p>In retrospection, certain EU countries emerge as stalwarts in logistics excellence, consistently registering top-notch LPI scores. While countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden consistently rank high, the broader EU collective also showcases commendable logistics performance. Even when considering the lower-tiered performers within the EU, their standings remain competitive on a global scale. Latvia, with its 76th rank in 2012, represents the lowest an EU country has ranked across the studied timeline.</p><p>In summation, the European Union, buttressed by its leading nations, establishes itself as a beacon of logistics efficiency. This steadfast performance underscores the EU's commitment to refining and advancing its logistics machinery.</p>
