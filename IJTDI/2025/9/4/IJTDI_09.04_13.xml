      <abstract><p>The purpose of the research was to find out the most efficient method to measure the longitudinal profile irregularities of the railway track geometry. Some researchers used an accelerometer installed at the axle-box bogie to monitor the longitudinal profile of the railway track. However, the method was risky because the accelerometer could disappear due to improper installation. In this research, the accelerometer was installed in the train cabin. The scope of analysis started with the IMU calibration by manual technique, filtering the Z-axis acceleration of IMU data by the Kalman Filter method, and converting to longitudinal profile data by double integral calculation. The normal distribution of the longitudinal profile of the railway track based on the acceleration data and measurement data of the track geometry measuring train (TGMT) was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Method. The paired comparison test used the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test method, and test results showed the P-value is 0.725 (left rail) and 0.073 (right rail), which are greater than 0.05. Therefore, no difference between the longitudinal profile based on the TGMT data and the longitudinal profile based on accelerometer data analysis, and the longitudinal profile irregularities can be monitored by using the accelerometer in the train cabin. The use of this method will support SDGs 9, build resilient infrastructure.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The railways had the advantage of having their track, with two parallel rails set at a certain distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. With this advantage, railways are relatively free from congestion compared to road infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] and occupy 2–3 times less land per passenger than other modes of road transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. When compared to airplanes, trains have the advantage of producing fewer emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. The railway line capacity will increase if the railway line has double-track construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Railway is one of the land transportation infrastructures, besides road transportation. The train, as a mode of railway transportation, has been the most popular land transportation mode in Indonesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the railway maintenance system in Indonesia is based on the Track Quality Index (TQI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. The TQI was a value derived from measuring the geometric conditions of railway tracks using the track geometry measuring train (TGMT) at 25 cm intervals along the railway length. One of the measuring geometry trains operated in Indonesia is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The use of TGMT to acquire railroad quality data was accompanied by several disadvantages. Utilizing a measuring geometry train for measurements would incur relatively high costs. Apart from requiring high costs, checking the geometry condition of the railroad using a measuring geometry train will potentially disrupt the commercial train schedule that has been prepared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. The operation of the TGMT will adjust to the commercial train travel schedule that has been prepared. Consequently, the frequencies of the TGMT inspections are relatively low, potentially leading to undetected geometry problems on the railway. During the rainy season, the optical laser sensor equipment on the measuring geometry train typically experiences interference due to environmental conditions in the structure beneath the railroad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Overall, the use of the TGMT for the measurement of railway track geometry was not efficient.</p>

      <p>Railway infrastructure must ensure the safety of train travel. The Ministry of Transportation’s Transportation Information Book (BIT) 2022 reports that derailments caused 62 out of 71 railway transportation accidents in Indonesia, accounting for 87.33% of these incidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. The geometric condition of the railway track was identified as one of the causes of derailments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. These accidents caused disruptions in train travel. Efficient maintenance policies, based on risk assessment for various infrastructure components, are necessary to anticipate potential problems in railway infrastructure and prevent train travel disruptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The dynamic response of a train cabin was the movement of the train cabin structure as a reaction, one of which was caused by irregularity of the railway track. The dynamic response that occurs in a train cabin can be detected from the changes in the train cabin acceleration. The changes in train cabin acceleration were measured by an accelerometer. An accelerometer was a sensor tool that was used for acceleration measurement, and it was one type of inertial measurement unit (IMU). An IMU is an automatic tool for measuring acceleration, detecting and measuring vibration, and measuring acceleration due to the body’s inclination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. IMU becomes IMMU when it incorporates a magnetometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. In this research, the type of accelerometer used was an accelerometer that was part of the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS).</p><p>Installing accelerometers on operating trains allows for the monitoring of the railway geometry condition, providing valuable information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, this method does not require human power when operated concurrently with train operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]; therefore, the costs are relatively low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p><p>Acceleration refers to the change in an object’s speed over time. Acceleration occurred when the speed increased over time, and deceleration occurred when the speed decreased. However, deceleration occurred when the speed dropped from its previous level. Acceleration was also dependent on the direction or orientation, as it reduced the velocity of the vector. Changes in the direction of objects would also result in acceleration.</p><p>Several IMU sensor tools and methods were developed to check railway conditions more effectively and efficiently. An accelerometer was one of the IMUs that was frequently used to predict railway geometry conditions. Chudzikiewicz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] used an accelerometer on the axle-box of a bogie train. The study took place in Poland, and the TQI value that was found by analyzing the accelerometer data was compared to other railway quality indicators, specifically W5 and J Synthetic. Real et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] mounted an accelerometer on a train’s bogie axle-box to predict the longitudinal profile of a railway track. The prediction results of the railway longitudinal profile, which relied on accelerometer data, were compared with the longitudinal profile of the railroad track using trolley measurements. The research was conducted in Spain.</p><p>Weston et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] installed an accelerometer and pitch-rate gyro on the bogie axle-box of the UK’s Tyne and Wear Metro. These IMU data were compared with vertical profile data from the Track Record Vehicle (TRV) measurement 16 months earlier. Xing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] also used the IMU (pitch rate gyro) to monitor irregularities in the longitudinal vertical profile of the railway online. The study used only one type of IMU, specifically the bogie pitch-rate IMU. The results of the IMU measurements would be tested and compared with the actual conditions of irregularities in the vertical profile of the rail, which were obtained from measurements of China’s high-speed trains. Obrien et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] recorded vertical acceleration data and the angular speed of a train bogie using an IMU. The collected IMU data was used to predict the longitudinal profile of the railway using the cross-entropy optimization method. The research location was in Ireland, specifically on the Irish Rail Hyundai Rotem InterCity train.</p><p>Train axle-boxes install accelerometers to optimize measurement results for railway condition monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. The analysis utilized mathematical models and the accelerometer data’s dynamic frequency response. The research location was in India, which had a 1676-millimeter track gauge. Nadarajah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] conducted the research in Indonesia on the northern Surabaya - Lamongan railway line, using several IMUs to predict railway geometry parameters such as longitudinal, lateral, and cross-level profiles, based on the dynamic response behavior of IMUs installed at various train locations such as axle boxes, bogies, and carriages.</p><p>Accelerometers were also used to measure the comfort level of railway passengers (Passenger Ride Comfort, PRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. The object study was the railway track between Tehran to Mashhad, which is located in the central part of Iran. The length of the railway is about 114 km and has a high density of train traffic. An IMU was also used for comfort assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. The experiment was done in electric multiple units, called Alstom Metropolis 98 B. The measurements were recorded during the trip between the Marymont station to the Racławicka station. Three locations, the front, back, and middle of the vehicle, were selected.</p><p>Previous researchers had studied using accelerometers to monitor longitudinal profile, in which the accelerometers were mostly located at the axle-box of the train bogie. However, placing the IMU sensor in the axle-box of the train bogie has the potential to fall or be lost due to installation errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Another researcher had used the accelerometers in the train cabin, but the purpose was to monitor the comfort level of railway passengers. The summary of the literature study above will be shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

      <title>3. Limitation of study</title>
      <p>Due to limited information on the measurement data obtained and the sensor module in the IMU, this research will be limited to the following: There was no sensitivity analysis for calibration drift over time and temperature-induced MEMS bias.</p>

      <title>4. Methodology</title>
      <p>The research started with a literature study. The next step was data collection. The secondary data collected was the vertical alignment or longitudinal profile of the railway track data from the track geometry measurement train. The acceleration data of the train cabin was the primary data that had been collected in this research. </p><p>The primary data had to be calibrated because the acquisition of the primary data had errors in scaling, offset, and accelerometer-axis errors. The acceleration data of the train cabin that had been calibrated was filtered by using the Kalman Filter Method. The next step of analysis converted the filtered acceleration data into longitudinal profile data by double integration calculation.</p><p>The final step of the research compares the longitudinal profile data of the railway track based on the acceleration data of the train cabin with the longitudinal profile data of the railway track based on the TGMT. Both longitudinal profile data of the railroad track have been checked for normality of data distribution before being compared. Normality data testing uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Method. If neither of the data sets is normal, the comparison analysis will use the Student T-test, and vice versa, will use the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. </p>

            <title>4.1. Calibrating the acceleration data of the imu</title>
          
          <p>In this research, the IMU sensor tool used a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS). The use of MEMS as an IMU had many errors that affected on IMU measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Acceleration data of the train cabin should be calibrated by multiplying by the calibrating factor of the IMU sensor tool. Acceleration train cabin data should be calibrated because the acquisition data of the IMU sensor tool did not record actual acceleration due to many factors. The factors that affected of IMU measurement result were scaling error, offset error, non-orthogonality of accelerometer axis error, etc. The calibrating factor of the IMU sensor tool was obtained in a simple method by a mathematical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>].</p><p>A simple procedure to calibrate accelerometer data measurements was to put the IMU device in six standard positions. Additional requirements for implementing a simple accelerometer calibration procedure are six standard positions in a stable and flat environment. To obtain six standard positions in a stable and flat position, we used a table, a floor, and a window frame. The IMU device measured acceleration data for several seconds, and the results were averaged; therefore, the noise that occurs during the measurement for calibration would be reduced. The IMU device acceleration data vector from the measurement results for calibration or in six standard positions were <inline-formula>

          <p>Therefore, in this case, calibration does not need an inverted matrix process. But just a simple arithmetic calculation was required to find out the scaling factor and the offset for the calibration of train cabin acceleration data. This process was very cheap in computation and was done without additional software on the IMU device. The accuracy verification of the IMU calibration is done by comparing the actual train travel length and the double integral analysis of the Y-axis acceleration data.</p>

            <title>4.2. The kalman filter method</title>
          
          <p>Every sensor device has noise or interference that can affect the result of the measurement. In this study, noise filtering would use the Standard Kalman Filter because it consisted of sufficient equations for reducing noise. The Kalman filter was a popular method for noise filtering because it had easy computation and low memory requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. Rudolf E. Kalman proposed the Kalman Filter in 1960 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] and applied it to many fields, including tracking objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] and navigation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. The various methods of the Kalman Filter were the Standard Kalman Filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], Extended Kalman Filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], Unscented Kalman Filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], and Ensemble Kalman Filter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. The simplest approach of the Kalman Filter was the standard Kalman Filter, because the other approaches were adjusted for more complicated computations. The predictions and correct equations in the Kalman filter were shown in Eqs. (14)–(18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]:</p><p>Predict:</p>

          <p>Statistical Analysis was taken by comparing the mean of the longitudinal profile railway track data of measuring TGMT with the mean of the longitudinal profile railway track based on the acceleration data of the train cabin. Both data sets will be analyzed statistically to determine whether the data are paired or not; it is called a paired 2-sample dependent test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. There were 2 types of statistical analysis mentioned above, Student’s T-test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. Student’s T-test will be used if the TGMT data and train cabin acceleration data are in normal distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. The formula of Student’s T-test was shown in Eq. (20):</p>

              <p>The first step of statistical analysis was to test the distribution of both datasets, whether normal or not normal. If both datasets were normally distributed, the method of statistical analysis was the Student T-test. However, if both datasets were not normally distributed, the method of statistical analysis was the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Normality data testing used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Method. The null hypothesis of normality data testing was that the sample data had a normal distribution. The data was in normal distribution if the P-value or asymptotic significance (2-tailed) value was more than 0.05.</p>

              <p>The initial step in a two-sample pair of samples was to determine the null hypothesis of the statistical test. In this research, the null hypothesis was that there was no difference between the longitudinal profile railway data based on the acceleration data of the train cabin and the longitudinal profile railway data based on the TGMT measurement; vice versa, for the alternate hypothesis, the profile railway track data based on TGMT and the profile railway track data based on the train cabin's acceleration data differed. The method was used to test two dependent pairs of samples that were Student's T-test or the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, depending on data distribution (normal or not).</p>

            <title>5.1. Data collection</title>
          
          <p>The primary data collected in this research were dynamic response data in a train cabin. The dynamic response data that would be used was the train cabin acceleration. The collection of train cabin acceleration data, using an IMU sensor, consists of an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a GPS, and a time. The GPS and time acquisition were used to verify the calculation result in the analysis stage. The IMU sensor was installed on the floor of the train cabin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>). The data of the IMU sensor tool used for this research was Z-axis acceleration data. The sample rate of the IMU was set to 200 Hz, and the average speed of the train was 54 km/h or 15 m/s. Therefore, the corrected sampling rate of the IMU was recorded every 7.5 cm. The acceleration data on the left railway in the train cabin was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> showed the acceleration data on the right railway track.</p>

          <p>Another data required in this research was the longitudinal railway profile, which was the result of the geometry measurement of the railway by the TGMT. The railway track segment was chosen in the research, which was between Bandung to Rancaekek, KM 161+000—KM 168+000, which was a 7 km long segment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>). The speed of the TGMT that was recorded in the document of the survey report was 65.31 km/h. The selection of sample locations for the railway track segments should consider straight track, and the time interval between TGMT measurements and IMU measurements should not be too long. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> show the longitudinal irregularity of railway track data based on the geometry measuring train.</p>

          <p>As mentioned above (Section 3.1), acceleration data from train cabin data acquisition should be calibrated because the acquisition data of the IMU sensor tool in the train cabin did not record true physical acceleration due to many factors, including errors on scaling, offset, and non-orthogonality of the accelerometer axes, and noise that occurs during measurement. There were 2 parameters of calibration: the scale factor and the bias or offset value. After the six standard positions measurement, the calibration factor ($X<inline-formula>

          <p>If Z-axis accelerometer data in the train cabin were used to assess the longitudinal railway profile, it should be compared with the longitudinal profile railway data of the measuring geometry train. The sample rate of the IMU was set to 200 Hz, and the average speed of the train was 54 km/h or 15 m/s. Therefore, the corrected sampling rate of the IMU was recorded every 7.5 cm. The vertical profile data of the TGMT data was recorded every 25 cm; therefore, the acceleration data from IMU and TGMT will align at 187.5 cm or every 1.875 m.

          <p>The result of the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed that the null hypothesis was accepted because the P-value on the left rail was 0.725 and on the right rail was 0.073. All values of P-value were more than 0.05 (5%); the data of the longitudinal profile railway track, based on the processing of the train cabin acceleration data and based on the measurement of TGMT, were not different.</p><p>The longitudinal profile data were obtained from the measuring train in October 2022, and the accelerometer data from the IMU were obtained in January 2023. There was a 3-month difference between the TGMT data recording and the IMU acceleration data recording. Therefore, the P-value of the longitudinal profile of the right rail was 0.073, which approaches the threshold. This value, which is close to the minimum P-value, suggests that the irregularities of the railway were getting worse, or there were improvements to the longitudinal profile of the right rail.</p><p>The most common approach to analyzing effect size for a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was to calculate the rank biserial correlation coefficient ($r<inline-formula>

In this research, the result of the rank biserial correlation coefficient calculation was 0.0000000281 for the left side of the longitudinal profile and 0.0000001437 for the right side of the longitudinal profile. The value of the rank biserial correlation coefficient was almost zero, which means the booth sizes of the longitudinal profile have given a very small effect on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Currently, monitoring the geometric condition of railway tracks is still on the Track Geometric Measuring Train (TGMT). This research tries to develop a new method that is more efficient than usual, using dynamic response (acceleration) data within train cars. The sampling rate specification for the IMU sensor is to acquire data at a minimum of 25 cm at a train speed of 100 km/h. It is recommended to use an IMU sensor with a sampling rate of 200 Hz, while also considering the analysis of noise measurement.</p><p>The result of the analysis is no difference between the vertical profile railway data based on the acceleration data of the train cabin and the vertical profile railway data based on the measuring geometry train, because the result of the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test showed the null hypothesis accepted. After all, the P-value on the left rail is 0.725, and on the right rail is 0.073, which is greater than 0.05 (5%). Since there is no difference between the railway profile based on the TGMT and the longitudinal profile of railway data based on the acceleration data of the train cabin, the dynamic response in the train cabin could be able monitor the longitudinal profile of railways. The results of this research apply to trains using the same type of train bogie that was used to collect acceleration data. The type of train bogie was Bogie NT-11 (K-5).</p><p>The next study can be proposed, which involves monitoring the longitudinal profile of the railway track with a longer track segment or the lateral profile of the railway track by using dynamic response data in the train cabin, or proposing a mathematical model of the relationship between the dynamic response in the train cabin and the quality of the railway track. Further research should also consider that the time interval between TGMT measurements and IMU measurements should not be too long.</p>
