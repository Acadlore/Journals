      <abstract><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Geothermal energy, an efficacious and readily available resource, has emerged as a sustainable alternative poised to satisfy escalating global energy demands. This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of low (heat below 100℃) and medium (heat between 100℃ to 150℃) enthalpy geothermal energy through a bibliometric approach and a literature survey, with an emphasis on the environmental and economic aspects. The methodological procedure encompasses: (i) systematic information processing and configuration, (ii) bibliometric assessment of the evolution and domains of the investigated field, (iii) evaluation of environmental and economic contributions, and (iv) Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis, facilitated by a Focus Group comprising experts from the energy sector. The research on low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy has been identified as an expanding field, with five primary areas of focus: sustainability, cascade systems, heat pumps, numerical modelling, and groundwater potential in geothermal systems. Italy, the United States, and Germany have been recognized as the leading contributors in terms of scientific production. Geothermal energy, from an environmental standpoint, aids the decarbonisation process, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and other renewable energy sources. Although initial investment costs are considerable, the financial recovery period is relatively short. The promotion of geothermal energy, alongside the active involvement of academia, corporations, and governments, bolsters energy and socio-economic development, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The escalating global demand for electrical power, primarily driven by industrialization and urbanization, has underscored the burgeoning significance of renewable energy within the global energy sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Traditional energy resources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, necessitate sufficient capacity to sustain a balance between their availability and energy demand, as emphasized by Rosales-Calderon and Arantes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Moreover, existing energy consumption patterns could potentially exhaust these nonrenewable resources in the ensuing decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Compelling interest in alterations to our energy paradigm also stems from issues relating to climate change, global warming, and energy security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Consequently, the global community is increasingly tilting toward renewable energy, viewed as a reliable energy supply with diminished environmental impact. Evaluating natural resources, such as biodiversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], along with mining and energy resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], has emerged as a primary strategy in various countries to ensure their future availability.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Projections by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggest that the contribution of renewable energy to the total global energy capacity will experience a 50% upsurge between 2019 and 2024 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Renewable energies, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy, underpin this growth. However, the global energy system has thus far only marginally adopted geothermal energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. This form of energy originates from subterranean heat generated by rock temperatures, which increase with depth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. The relationship between temperature and depth, defined by the geothermal gradient, dictates the feasibility and utility of this resource-a higher geothermal gradient implies greater potential for exploitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Depending on these conditions, geothermal resources can be harnessed for diverse applications such as electricity generation, heating, cooling, drying, dehydration, food processing, and balneology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">From 1995 to 2019, the number of countries utilizing geothermal energy escalated from 28 to 88, with a 52% increase in geothermal usage reported between 2015 and 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. This growing interest in geothermal energy can be attributed to its non-reliance on weather conditions, granting it a distinct advantage over other renewable energy sources. Despite geographical constraints, geothermal energy can deliver consistent energy with a higher heat capacity than other renewable sources. Its efficiency hinges on enthalpy criteria and atmospheric conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Geothermal energy resources are categorized into convective or hydrothermal systems, conductive systems, and deep aquifers, providing high, medium, and low enthalpy resources based on temperature. Resources with high enthalpy surpass 150℃, while medium-enthalpy resources range between 100℃ and 150℃, and low-enthalpy resources are below 100℃ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">High-enthalpy geothermal energy, which constitutes 60% of the global installed capacity, has yielded remarkable results from economic, environmental, and energy efficiency perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Although medium-enthalpy resources have been underutilized due to the technological limitations of the 20th century, contemporary technologies such as the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), Kalina Cycle (KC), and direct applications, facilitate the exploitation of these resources through hybrid renewable energy systems, providing efficient and cost-effective energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. In recent years, low-enthalpy processes, primarily used in cooling due to climate change impacts, have seen significant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Low and medium-enthalpy geothermal energy have diverse applications, including heating-cooling, electricity, and water supply. As a response to socioeconomic growth and global climate variation, there is a rising need for refrigeration in the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors, particularly in Africa, Asia and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Clean cooling/heating resources are internationally interested in transforming renewable energy within the industrial sector, as the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century’s (REN21) Renewables 2018 Global Status Report indicates. According to a study by Gong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], “the geothermal industry is experiencing positive outside attention to its development activities”</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The cooling mechanism involves extracting geothermal heat from the subsoil to the cold refrigerant to evaporate it and convert it into low-pressure steam. The compressor receives this steam to increase the pressure and temperature and finally transports it to the condenser to convert the hot vapour into a liquid state of high pressure and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The vital role of geothermal energy necessitates a comprehensive literature review of the contributions of the scientific community and its applications in the public and industrial sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Bibliometric and literature reviews provide a profound and detailed insight into this field of study, utilizing systematic tools or techniques to extract bibliographic information from databases such as Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Numerous literature reviews on low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy have been conducted globally, discussing topics like geothermal resource storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], low-enthalpy geothermal exploitation mine-oriented enthalpy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>], the current understanding of the use of low-enthalpy geothermal energy cells for enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], and the legal framework of superficial geothermal energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. However, a comprehensive assessment of the economic and environmental aspects considered in this field remains elusive.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The relationship between the importance of geothermal energy and the literature review allows the generation of research questions such as: What research areas exist in the scientific production of low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy? What scientific contributions exist within geothermal energy’s environmental and economic aspects with low and medium enthalpy?</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">This work aims to analyze the importance of low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy, through bibliometric analysis and review of existing literature published in Scopus and WoS, for a strategic vision of strengthening and importance of renewable systems and an analysis of its application's environmental and economic aspects.</p>

          <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The study considered the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases to obtain publication records. These databases were selected because of the many high-quality standard journals that index publications from various scientific disciplines, which is crucial for longitudinal and review analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. This information contemplates studies conducted by academics and industrial entities focusing on energy development through Boolean term operators.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">In the search, it was defined that the algorithm reflects information based on the titles, abstracts and author keywords. The search equation used the following topics and conditions: (“geothermal” or “geothermal energy” or “geothermal power”) AND (“renewable energy” or “alternative energy” or “green energy”) AND (“low enthalpy” or “medium enthalpy”).</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Once the search was completed, the data were downloaded in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) and Bibtex formats.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Geothermal energy is a tool for solving the energy demand and reducing the environmental impacts of non-renewable energy sources. From an environmental point of view, low and medium enthalpy energy is a resource that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which cause global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>]. These techniques, commonly used in electricity generation, cooling, and heating systems, are widely used in urban and industrial areas with a clear objective of contributing to sustainable energy development.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The reviewed studies mainly reveal the functionality of low and medium enthalpy systems through case studies or global analyses, in which the use of geothermal energy is promoted internationally, complying with the current regulations of each country. According to Milenić et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>], shallow aquifers could be a strategic option for energy production for district heating and cooling as a medium or low enthalpy mechanism. These sources can increase the energy capacity of a city, reducing primary energy consumption by up to 60% and 70%, respectively. In Europe, various geothermal projects seek to supply the energy demand sustainably. However, efforts are still being made on other continents to promote this type of energy in urban systems, becoming a new technological challenge for adapting geothermal energy as a sustainable energy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>]. According to Carotenuto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>], it is possible to recover freezing probes connected to a thermo/cooling plant structured by a heat pump, inertial storage tanks, and circulation pumps. This system reduces the environmental impact and improves energy efficiency, adapting to the political guidelines of world organisations related to the change in the energy matrix and promoting the reuse of existing structures.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Although implementing geothermal systems represents a sustainable alternative, inadequate resource management can contribute to physical properties and soil temperature alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>]. Among the environmental effects registered by geothermal energy, most consider the construction phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>] owing to the diesel consumption by the drilling platform, the steel used for the casing of the wells, and the construction of the power plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>]. One option to mitigate these environmental effects is to use biodiesel or non-contact drilling technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_84">84</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Another alternative for improving and optimising the efficiency of geothermal systems is the cascading use of low and medium enthalpy resources as a sequential technique of geothermal heat, generally for generating electricity, heating or cooling, recreational uses, or drying or dehydration processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>]. Finally, studies such as Lohse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>] recommend successful exploration to access geothermal deposits with minimal drilling efforts, thereby reducing the environmental impact in the construction stage.</p>

                <title>3.4.2 Economic aspect</title>
              
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Economic evaluations show that geothermal systems are economically profitable in long- and short-term projects, but they will depend on the objective of the work (e.g., change in the matrix or energy expansion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>]. A study by Mac-Lean et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>] concluded that there were greater savings when cooling capacities were used instead of heating in geothermal mechanisms. Part of the economic investment is the heat pump and execution of the well for pumping and reinjection of the water used at the end of the industrial cycle.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Although the evaluation of the economic and environmental aspects of geothermal resources is rarely addressed in scientific literature, specific studies have presented the advantages and disadvantages of these aspects (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>]). Implementing a geothermal system requires a novel concept of drilling that does not involve overpricing through an innovative design and intelligent measurement of business associations to reduce the initial investment costs significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>]. From an economic point of view, the transition of the energy matrix with a focus on geothermal resources represents a high investment in the construction stage. However, the recovery rate of this type of project is possible within a few years, depending on the magnitude of the implemented system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">From the studies reviewed in this research, the authors pointed out three key points for achieving an efficient and profitable project: i) the participation of a group of companies that are interested or dedicated to geothermal exploitation works; ii) the technical use of studies carried out in this area to understand the case study and actual drilling costs; and iii) good communication in the exploration phase between geothermal companies and local communities.</p>

          <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">In an internal context, reducing greenhouse gas emissions through surface exploitation systems with affordable maintenance costs is a strength of geothermal resources. This type of system is suitable for application in urban areas, reducing energy consumption and representing significant economic savings. However, among the weaknesses of this type of renewable energy, the high cost of the initial investment (construction phase) stands out, in which the drilling stage represents an environmental impact owing to the increased use of diesel.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">On the other hand, from the analysis of external aspects, it is important to mention that geothermal systems represent an opportunity to diversify the global energy matrix, in which the increase of professionals with knowledge of exploration, exploitation, and maintenance in geothermal systems is essential. However, few political laws have supported this type of green energy. At the global level, politics, energy competition, and inadequate design of geothermal systems represent the main threats that condition resource exploitation.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Based on an analysis of the internal and external aspects of the investigated field, this study proposes strategies that promote the investigation of geothermal energy considering social, environmental, political, and academic aspects for the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). 7 (Affordable Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action):</p><p style="text-align: justify"><inline-formula>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The methodological approach used in this study allowed the integration of three types of analysis within the field of low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy research: i) bibliometric analysis to evaluate scientific production and distribution, ii) literature review of economic aspects and environmental factors considered within the field, and iii) SWOT qualitative analysis to establish promotion strategies and strengthen geothermal resources.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">According to the bibliometric analysis, the scientific production of low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy has developed since 1984, with exponential growth in the last 26 years, representing approximately 93% of the total output. This marked difference from the first two decades could refer mainly to the increase in scientific interest in promoting sustainable energy transition at a global level. Within this scientific boom in the field, it is possible to identify research focused on the design and evaluation of geothermal systems for urban and industrial use; integration of energy systems that combine sustainable sources; and analysis of technical, social, and environmental aspects that guarantee the functionality of the geothermal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>]. On the other hand, it is important to highlight Italy, Spain, and Germany as countries with the greatest contribution to the field (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). Italy’s scientific contributions among these countries reflect the highest number of citations with collaborations with Australia, Germany, and the United States (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Analysing intellectual structure through scientific maps based on keywords allowed us to define five research areas in low and medium enthalpy geothermal energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>). Within these areas, it is important to highlight “cascade systems: geothermal polygeneration” as an emerging line of research within the field with a clear objective of sequentially using subsoil heat through polygeneration, combining different scales of use from electricity generation to recreational use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">On the other hand, the review of scientific literature with contributions within the environmental and economic fields of geothermal energy exposes the importance of implementing this system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that pollute the atmosphere and compromise ecosystems and human security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_89">89</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_90">90</xref>]. From an environmental perspective, the findings reveal that geothermal energy is a renewable energy source with minimal environmental impact, which mitigates air pollution generated by other types of energy. However, drilling in the construction stage is one of the main environmental effects of excessive diesel consumption. These problems can be mitigated by correctly selecting sustainable geothermal equipment, which will contribute to reducing these emissions and energy transitions in the face of environmental pollution problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>]. According to Parisi and Basosi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_91">91</xref>], developing technological equipment for deep geothermal exploitation will allow this energy to be a cleaner and safer source with greater social acceptability, considering that these technologies are intended for the reinjection of geothermal fluids. This progress will make it possible to strengthen decision-making in the planning and promotion processes of technologies, considering control in the manufacture of geothermal equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_93">93</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Considering the economic aspect, the literature review presents case studies that validate geothermal systems' economic viability compared with other energy types. The economic evaluations revealed electricity generation at costs below $0.15/kWh, representing primary electricity savings of up to 70%. Geothermal systems show viability in small- and large-scale projects with investments that can be recovered in the short term with rates of return greater than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>]. The analysis of Ahmed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_89">89</xref>] indicates that geothermal systems have a low economic index relative to fossil systems, with a productivity of up to 17 years. Under technical conditions, geothermal heat pumps generate energy savings of 81 million tons for electricity generation from fuel-oil systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Under these statements, the findings of different investigations will depend on local conditions, the energy efficiency of the technologies in question, and the prices of subsidies.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Based on the focus group analysis implemented in this study, the proposed strategies strengthen the participation of geothermal energy in the industry, considering environmental, economic, technical, and social challenges. The analyses revealed that the need for effective mechanisms for implementation and commercial energy competition is the main barrier to promoting geothermal systems in urban sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_95">95</xref>]. Global experience indicates that government support is key to geothermal development through loan programs, industrial insurance, grants, and exploration projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_96">96</xref>]. In addition, Balzan-Alzate et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_97">97</xref>] indicated that the acceptance and knowledge of this type of energy must be considered in the energy contexts of each country because the change in context could alter the objectives in the future.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Marketing strategies allow geothermal to compete with other types of renewable energy, through the contribution of government frameworks, for promotion at the urban and industrial levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_98">98</xref>]. Likewise, the scientific-academic contribution is important in training knowledge of installing, producing, and maintaining geothermal systems with application in urban or rural residences. This strategy reduces operational accidents and security risks to social communities.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Despite the low promotion and participation of geothermal energy in energy development, efforts by countries and world organisations that offer the benefits of geothermal energy have been rescued. In addition, some developing countries have shown an interest in developing industrial projects with geothermal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_99">99</xref>]. For example, a dozen Latin American and Caribbean countries are working on developing power plants based on geothermal systems to reduce the use of fossil fuels and balance their economies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_100">100</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_101">101</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Within the tourism sector, the promotion of geothermal resources has high potential. Some studies have promoted balneology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_102">102</xref>], the development of greenhouses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_103">103</xref>], geothermal parks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_104">104</xref>] and tourist trails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_105">105</xref>] as strategies to promote community awareness through information panels on the potential and contribution towards sustainable development of geothermal energy globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_106">106</xref>].</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Therefore, scientists have highlighted the importance of geothermal promotion to strengthen energy development in areas with resource scarcity problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_96">96</xref>]. This promotion can be achieved with multi-generic projects that allow optimal use, such as urban buildings that require electricity, heating, or cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_107">107</xref>]. Under this premise, it is possible to affirm that any mechanism promoting the direct use of geothermal energy requires incorporating planning aspects related to territorial use.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">This review highlights the importance of using medium- and low-enthalpy geothermal energy sequentially by implementing geothermal cascade systems. Additionally, it is recommended that future studies on medium and low geothermal research consider an analysis of the sociopolitical aspect as a conditioning factor for the success of this type of renewable energy.</p>

      <title>5. 5. conclusions</title>
      <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The evolution of medium or low enthalpy geothermal energy corresponds to the development of renewable energy innovation originating mainly in European countries. This energy represents an alternative to industrial, political, and social interests and contributes to mitigating the effects of climate change. The bibliometric analysis and literature review carried out in this study reflects research that validates the sustainability of low and medium enthalpy geothermal systems compared to conventional systems through five research areas: i) geothermal energy and its contribution to developing sustainable, ii) cascade systems: geothermal polygeneration, iii) geothermal heat pumps (GHP) as a tool for geothermal use, iv) numerical simulation for the design of geothermal systems, and v) groundwater in the use of geothermal energy.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The literature review of the economic and environmental aspects of this type of system highlights energy savings, with a high investment recovery rate and minimal environmental impacts. However, the lack of public policy considerations that strengthen the implementation of geothermal systems as opportunities for social growth in urban or rural areas and industrial or energy production sectors is evident.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">According to the SWOT analysis, geothermal energy, from the point of view of internal aspects, represents a sustainable energy source that mitigates environmental pollution and supplies global energy demand. However, the high investment costs and technological advances limit the applicability of this type of system. On the other hand, the analysis of external aspects mainly reflects the possibility of promoting geothermal energy through tourism, as well as the implementation of polygeneration systems that optimise the extracted resources; however, there is little support within the political framework in which it is necessary to guarantee sustainable exploration and exploitation from an economic and environmental point of view.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The strategies consider academic-scientific and political participation as a general link criterion between the various sectors, which can be managed in strategic areas with active geothermal systems for efficient production. This type of interaction would allow the implementation of efficient geothermal systems with considerable energy savings that can be replicated internationally to satisfy global energy demand.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">Finally, the proposed methodological approach represents a tool for researchers to learn about the main research areas within low- and medium-enthalpy geothermal energy and to develop research on emerging topics. The main limitation of this study is the analysis of the academic literature. However, industrial and government sector information needs to be published and represents great value. Future research studies within the field should consider the environmental and economic analyses of different systems designed with political-social considerations that guarantee the acceptance and functionality of the system.</p>
