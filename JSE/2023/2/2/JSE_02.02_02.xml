      <abstract><p>Understanding the response of buildings to wind loads is critical, as these forces can generate significant pressure and suction, potentially leading to structural failure if overlooked. This research was focused on examining the effects of openings on triangular-shaped buildings when subjected to high wind load conditions. Utilizing CAD modeling and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, the analysis was executed through the ANSYS simulation package. Subsequent Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) studies were conducted to ascertain shear stress and lateral deformation. The studies encompassed building models both with and without openings, with the evaluation of induced pressure and velocity. The resultant drag on buildings incorporating openings was discovered to be 6679N lower than those without openings. Furthermore, an analysis employing M25 concrete indicated a 33.13$3 \%$ reduction in lateral deformation in buildings with openings as compared to those without. For buildings constructed with M30 concrete, a 32.17$3 \%$ decrease in lateral deformation was observed. Despite the informative findings, it should be recognized that the investigation was confined to a particular range of wind load conditions and did not consider extreme scenarios. Dynamic wind effects and long-term structural behavior were not included in the current analysis. Therefore, while this study elucidates the importance of wind load analysis and structural reinforcement for maintaining building stability, further research is warranted. Such future investigations should consider broader simulation models, encompassing diverse building shapes and wind load conditions, and account for additional influential factors.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Rising incidents of severe weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones, and strong windstorms underscore the increasing imperative for resilient and durable infrastructure. The forceful impact of wind on building structures worldwide presents a substantial challenge, jeopardizing the safety and stability of edifices if not aptly addressed during design and construction phases. A consequence of land scarcity in urban spaces is the proliferation of multi-story buildings, specifically high-rise towers. Although they maximize available space effectively, these structures grapple with unique structural problems including stiffness, lateral displacement, and susceptibility to lateral loads, particularly wind loads. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay between these variables is paramount.</p><p>Wind loads, essentially the forces that wind exerts on a structure, have significant bearings on the design and performance of a building. They have direct implications on structural safety and stability, influencing the design and construction of structural members and connections. Beyond this, wind loads play a crucial role in shaping the performance of the building envelope, including cladding systems, windows, and doors, from the perspective of water resistance, air leakage, and thermal efficiency. In terms of occupant comfort and safety, they affect factors such as indoor air quality, noise levels, and vibration. Therefore, adhering to building codes and standards, which encompass wind load provisions, is vital to ensure structural integrity and regulatory compliance.</p><p>A commonly adopted approach for investigating the aerodynamic behavior of building prototypes and validating design methodologies is wind tunnel testing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. Experiments of this kind offer invaluable insights into the intricate flow patterns and pressures experienced by buildings under diverse wind conditions, assisting in the development of accurate wind load models.</p>

      <p>The execution of wind load analysis is indispensable in the design process for optimizing the efficiency of the building envelope, ensuring structural stability and security, enhancing occupant comfort and safety, and adhering to building regulations. This complex task, which requires the expertise of professionals, incorporates principles of structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and construction science to accurately assess and quantify wind loads, their distribution across the building, and their potential effects on the structure. The insights derived from wind load analysis empower designers and engineers to make informed decisions on structural design, material selection, and construction techniques, ensuring that buildings are equipped to withstand the expected wind loads throughout their intended service life. The overarching objective is to create resilient and sustainable structures capable of standing up to the challenges posed by wind and other environmental forces, guaranteeing the safety and well-being of occupants and the long-term durability of the built environment. The study by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] underlines the importance of accurately estimating heat dissipation from external walls in space heating applications, offering equations for calculating heat dissipation coefficients and presenting a methodology to enhance the accuracy of estimated heating loads. The study found that wind speed has a more pronounced effect on the thermal energy dissipation flux at the outer surfaces of an isolated low-rise building than wind direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the realm of structural engineering, an extensive body of research has sought to discern the seismic and wind behaviors of high-rise structures. Notably, an exploration by Jia and Duan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] into a twelve-story frame-shear wall building's performance under the strains of seismic and wind phenomena revealed intriguing insights. Located in a coastal city of China, this building was scrutinized under the load code for building design. By adopting an equivalent static load in place of the dynamic wind load, the research was carried out. It was found that during an 8-degree earthquake, the movements of the base isolators mirrored those observed under wind speeds between 30 to 50 m/s. Furthermore, it was noticed that a wind velocity of 70 m/s generated displacement greater than that during an 8-degree earthquake, despite the rarity of such wind speeds.</p><p>An alternate approach, relying on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical method, was employed by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] to devise a model of a building and a tower crane, investigating varying lateral and longitudinal spacing ratios. This study succeeded in acquiring wind load coefficients for the tower crane, both in the presence and absence of the surrounding building. Results highlighted the building's interference effect on the tower crane under varying spacing ratios and wind directions, predominantly demonstrating a shielding effect. It was found that the distribution pattern of the interference factor along the mast section's height adhered to a cubic function for wind directions of 0°, 30°, and 60°. However, in contrast, it followed a quadratic function for wind directions of 120° and 150°.</p><p>Given the burgeoning construction of high-rise structures worldwide, the influence of wind load on such buildings has come under increased scrutiny. An investigation by Jamaluddeen and Banerjee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] utilized ETABS Software 2016 to analyze wind loads, with buildings classified based on their height and varying geometrical shapes. The vulnerability of these structures to wind due to their position and height was central to their research.</p><p>Simultaneously, Du et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] examined the effects of a single cross-shaped super-high-rise building, as well as a proposed group of four similar buildings. By studying different distances and wind directions, a multitude of parameters were evaluated. It was discovered that the wind direction had a greater influence than the spacing between buildings on wind pressure and base wind parameters. Furthermore, the building's equivalent base wind's impact was found to be swayed by the wind interference effect.</p><p>In parallel, Mohapatra and Rath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] concentrated their research on the modeling and analysis of square or rectangular buildings of 30, 40, and 50 stories, applying wind loads to their study. They used both the static method and the Gust Effect Factor (GEF) method, according to IS: 875 (Part 3) - 1987, to determine these loads. The natural frequencies of these structures were ascertained using STAAD. Pro V8i SS6, a structural analysis and design software. This study set out to comprehend the correlation between wind loading and the resulting natural frequencies.</p><p>In a novel approach, Xue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] utilized wind-induced displacement and acceleration responses to identify structural states, parameters, and unknown wind loads from incomplete measurements. Their method was validated through numerical simulations on a ten-story building and wind tunnel testing on a 234m tall building, providing invaluable insights into practical applications.</p><p>Elias et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] embarked on a study of a benchmark building equipped with tuned mass dampers (TMDs) to reduce wind and earthquake-induced dynamic responses. A comparison of multiple TMD (MTMD) schemes with single TMD (STMD) configurations was conducted. It was concluded that distributed TMDs effectively controlled acceleration for tall structures under wind and earthquake forces.</p><p>The work of Bingöl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] compared different methods for estimating Weibull characteristics using wind speed data gathered from a 101 m Mast equipped with cup anemometers. The data spanned a full year and had a high recovery rate of over 99<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>. The findings of this study underscored the difficulties faced in parameter estimation due to the high occurrence of low wind speeds. Finally, a study by Cui and Caracoglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] applied a generalized aerodynamic formulation to analyze the wind-induced dynamic response of tall buildings. This research captured complex structural motion and accounted for multi-directional wind load effects, providing a universal formula for the dynamic analysis of bluff bodies, such as tall buildings.</p><p>These diverse methodologies, from equivalent static loads to numerical modeling, reveal the multifaceted nature of wind load analysis on structures. The complexity of predicting wind patterns around buildings, particularly tall structures, necessitates continuous research to ensure the safety and sustainability of our built environment. However, it remains evident that despite the structural complexity and the uncertainty of wind data, accurate prediction and modeling of wind loads can enhance structural design and lead to more resilient buildings.</p><p>This investigation delves into the intricate dynamics of fluid-structure interaction in the realm of high-rise architecture subjected to wind loading. This exploration aims to elucidate the inherent dynamism and stability that ensues from these complex interplays between fluid flow (wind) and structural components. Significantly, the investigation aspires to inform a nuanced understanding of how fluid-structure interaction impacts structural integrity, performance, and safety of high-rise structures.</p><p>Four specific objectives provide the backbone of this research:</p><p>This investigation delves into the intricate dynamics of fluid-structure interaction in the realm of high-rise architecture subjected to wind loading.

These studies are expected to yield pivotal insights into the distribution of shear stress and lateral deformation within the structure.</p><p>The implications of the findings from this study are expected to reverberate through the field of architecture and engineering, particularly those working on the design and construction of high-rise buildings. The study aims to engender an enhanced understanding of structural behavior under wind loads, and the consequent design considerations that must be taken into account. It is expected that these findings will enable architects and engineers to create safer and more efficient buildings, therefore ensuring the well-being of occupants and the surrounding communities.</p><p>In essence, this investigation stands as a crucial step towards decoding the behavior of high-rise buildings under the influence of high wind loads. It endeavors to shed light on the effects of openings on the structural response, thus paving the way for advancements in design methodologies and enhancing the sphere of structural safety. Through the synergistic application of CAD modeling, CFD simulation, and FSI studies, the study is projected to provide transformative insights into the dynamics of high-rise buildings under wind loading.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>The methodology employed in this study was based on the use of ANSYS simulation package to conduct Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of a high-rise building structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].

These conditions incorporated parameters such as wind speed and flow direction, providing a realistic portrayal of environmental conditions.</p><p>The solution stage of the simulation, performed using ANSYS, involved solving the governing equations for fluid flow and pressure. Through this process, vital insights into the forces and pressures exerted on the building structure were obtained.</p><p>In conclusion, this multi-step CFD simulation methodology facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the building's structural response to wind loading.

      <p>The convergence analysis of the simulation, presented visually via RMS residual plots, serves as an indicator of solution precision, wherein an RMS residual value below 0.0001 was established as the convergence criterion. Continual monitoring of these RMS residual values throughout the simulation facilitated their analysis. As the simulation evolved, a decreasing trend in the RMS residual values signaled convergence towards the intended level of accuracy. Such decrease is visually exemplified by the plots, indicative of the simulation's attainment of the set convergence standard. When RMS residual values were observed below the prescribed 0.0001 threshold, the simulation's successful achievement of the desired degree of accuracy and reliability was affirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. This convergence establishes the results as trustworthy and accurate representations of the building's response under simulated wind conditions. As a tool for convergence assessment, the RMS residual plots reveal the simulation process' capacity to yield reliable and accurate outcomes, which in turn, can inform further analysis and evaluation, offering crucial insights into the building's behavior in the given wind environment.</p><p>The building's CAD design was imported into ANSYS Design Modeler for a comprehensive Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

      <p>This investigation applies a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulation to analyze a building's reaction to wind-induced forces comprehensively, where the dynamic relationship between the structure and fluid (air) is accounted for. FSI simulation's worthiness stems from its capacity to offer insights into the building's behavior under wind-loading conditions.

              <p>The present analysis has provided crucial insights into the distribution of lateral deformation across the investigated structure. In the lower portions, a minimal lateral deformation has been identified, with a gradual increase observable as elevation rises. Of particular note is the pronounced lateral deformation evident at the building's pinnacle, registering at an approximate value of 7.3349mm (around 0.29 in). Thus, the study underscores the necessity for careful consideration of structural stability and integrity, particularly with respect to lateral loads and potential deformation. It is inferred that strategic implementation of design measures, such as appropriate reinforcement or structural modifications, based on this distribution of deformation can potentially enhance the building's resilience throughout its height. The application of these insights has promising implications for optimizing design and construction processes, contributing to the creation of structures of greater safety and robustness. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> shows the CFD analysis results from the comparison.</p>

              <p>Further analysis involving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has shed light on the implications of design adaptations. Findings indicate that a design incorporating an opening result in significantly lower induced pressure when compared to a design devoid of openings. The induced pressure on the building with an opening measure at approximately 1361.59Pa, as visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_25">Figure 25</xref>. This marked reduction in induced pressure underscores the potential benefit of including building openings as a strategy to mitigate pressure accumulation, thereby enhancing the overall stability and resilience of the structure.</p>

              <p>The velocity comparison chart, presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_26">Figure 26</xref>, depicts that the inclusion of an opening leads to a lower induced velocity relative to a design without an opening. This reduction in induced velocity, achieved through the facilitation of air passage via the openings, contributes to improved structural stability and minimizes risks associated with high wind velocities. The relevance of such findings cannot be overstated for architects and engineers aiming to design structures that can effectively manage wind loads, thus ensuring the safety and comfort of occupants while optimizing structural performance.</p>

              <p>Additionally, an examination of drag forces has been performed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_27">Figure 27</xref> elucidates a significant reduction in induced drag for the design with an opening compared to the design without an opening. The measured drag force for the design incorporating an opening is approximately 3960.63N, compared to 10369N for the design without an opening. This considerable decrease in drag force highlights the aerodynamic benefits of including openings in the design. By facilitating wind passage, the design incorporating openings effectively minimizes the detrimental effects of drag, contributing to enhanced structural stability and reduced wind-induced loads.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The comprehensive CFD analysis presented in this study offers valuable insights into the wind load characteristics of triangular-shaped buildings constructed with M25 and M30 concrete. Employing the k-omega turbulence model, accurate simulations of airflow patterns and pressure distributions were achieved, taking into account adverse pressure gradients and streamlined curvature. The results revealed a significant reduction in induced drag for buildings with openings compared to those without, with a noteworthy decrease of 6679N in induced drag observed, emphasizing the effectiveness of openings in mitigating wind forces and enhancing overall structural stability. Moreover, the assessment of lateral deformation, a vital factor for structural integrity, exhibited considerable reductions in buildings with openings. Construction with M25 and M30 concrete led to reductions of 33.13$70 \%<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>70 \%$, respectively, in lateral deformation when compared to buildings without openings. These findings underscore the positive impact of openings on the resistance to wind-induced deformations.</p><p>While the results contribute to the understanding of wind engineering and hold practical implications for the construction industry, it is crucial to recognize the limitations of the study. The analysis relied on specific assumptions and boundary conditions, which may not fully represent all real-world situations. The accuracy of the findings depends on the precision of the input data and the assumptions made during the simulation.</p><p>To further advance the field of wind engineering, future research could explore several areas. One potential direction is the application of advanced wind tunnel testing techniques to capture complex flow patterns and turbulent effects around buildings. Additionally, incorporating nonlinear structural analysis methods may increase the accuracy of predictions, particularly for flexible and slender structures. Obtaining site-specific wind data through advanced anemometry techniques, such as LIDAR or UAV measurements, can significantly improve the precision of wind load calculations. In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights into the wind load characteristics of triangular-shaped buildings and emphasizes the advantages of incorporating openings for improved structural stability. Despite the limitations, these findings hold practical implications for professionals in architecture, engineering, and design involved in building construction and wind engineering. By implementing the insights obtained from this research and exploring future avenues of investigation, practitioners can enhance the wind load resistance and overall structural performance of triangular-shaped buildings, leading to safer and more resilient structures in the built environment.</p>
