      <abstract>Recent transmission of large volumes of data through mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has resulted in degraded Quality of Service (QoS) due to factors such as packet loss, delay, and packet drop in multipath routing. To address this issue, a traffic-aware Enhanced QoS-Aware Multipath Routing Protocol (EQMRP) has been proposed for real-time IoT applications in MANETs. EQMRP efficiently switches between multiple paths and monitors traffic conditions to maintain an optimal data transmission rate. The proposed method considers different delay sensitivity levels and link expiration time (LTE) to maintain QoS in each path. Through IoT application data analysis, EQMRP maintains QoS in each path more efficiently than conventional methods. The proposed method has been simulated and validated using MATLAB, and the performance analysis shows that EQMRP achieves a higher packet delivery ratio, lower delay, and reduced packet drop compared to conventional methods. In conclusion, the traffic-aware EQMRP protocol offers a significant improvement in QoS for real-time IoT applications in MANETs.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are wireless mobile nodes that transmit data without a centralized infrastructure. However, this makes it challenging to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) due to limited power and bandwidth, changing topology, and real-time applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>QoS support is critical in wireless and mobile networking with jitter, packet delivery ratio, throughput, and end-to-end latency being important considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Conventional routing protocols, such as table-driven and demand-based, have limitations in addressing MANET challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. For example, table-based techniques like OLSR add significant overhead even when there is no real traffic, while on-demand protocols like Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) cause delays and overburden some intermediary nodes due to frequent data processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>To address these challenges, the proposed QoS-aware routing protocol monitors traffic conditions and efficiently switches operations. It identifies and sends high-priority real-time application data across low-latency MANET paths, considers different delay sensitivity levels and link expiration time, and selects the optimal path that meets QoS requirements while minimizing network bandwidth and battery consumption. The proposed protocol is evaluated through simulations, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving QoS metrics compared to conventional methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. In conclusion, the proposed QoS-aware routing protocol can contribute to the development of efficient and reliable MANETs for real-time applications. The research in this area is crucial for addressing the challenges of wireless and mobile networking settings and enabling the seamless communication of mobile devices. The proposed protocol can also serve as a benchmark for future research in this area.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the fundamental block diagram of a MANET using IoT, which highlights the key components of the network and their interactions.

          <p>Several techniques have been investigated to improve Quality of Service (QoS) in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), with a focus on supporting real-time applications and services. One such technique is the Priority-Aware Dynamic Source Routing (PA-DSR) protocol proposed by Biswas and Dasgupta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. This protocol assigns priority based on data rates to improve QoS for routing. Simulation results showed that the proposed PA-DSR protocol outperformed the conventional DSR protocol in terms of throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and end-to-end delay for five unique connections. Noorul et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] conducted performance analysis research to study the impact of different routing protocols on Quality of Service (QoS) for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications over Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). The routing protocols investigated included AODV, TORA, OLSR, and GRP, while different queuing choices such as FIFO, PQ, and WFQ were also analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Their results showed that Jitter delay, packet delay in transit, and wireless LAN media access response time and throughput of 802.11 g technology at 54 Mbps are important factors that affect the quality of VoIP conversations. Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] proposed a smart routing method to connect an IoT service and its real-world data flow, aimed at improving the routing protocol in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). Their proposed method can be used for urgent data services such as environmental monitoring using real-time data. The authors developed a new way to incorporate MANET overlays and construct them collectively over MANET to improve IoT urban data. Their proposed method can dynamically identify and send high-priority real-time application data across low-latency MANET paths. Sharma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] presented TCP/IP traffic shaping techniques for real-time congestion control in the network model. They used a real-time token bucket to determine the number of buffer sizes and bucket sizes based on the result of the flow. Their results showed that the recommended solutions worked better in a congested traffic environment.</p><p>Mallikarjunaswamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] proposed a mobility measure that accounts for the complicated network mobility situation in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). Their proposed metric can handle new link breakages and/or link additions and is well-suited for mobile nodes that exhibit a non-zero pattern of Poisson distribution. The authors suggest that their proposed metric can enhance both the objective and subjective measures of network productivity and effectiveness.</p><p>This study proposes an Enhanced QoS-Aware Multipath Routing Protocol (EQMRP) for real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), building upon previous works. The proposed method employs traffic condition monitoring and efficient switching operations, considers different delay sensitivity levels and link expiration time, and dynamically identifies and sends high-priority real-time application data across low-latency MANET paths. Simulation results show that EQMRP achieves a higher packet delivery ratio, lower delay, and reduced packet drop compared to conventional methods. These findings suggest that EQMRP can be an effective solution for improving Quality of Service (QoS) in real-time IoT applications in MANETs.</p>

            <title>3.1. Overview</title>
          
          <p>As part of this work, a disjoint multipath routing mechanism has been introduced for the transmission of various Internet of Things (IoT) traffic classes, aimed at ensuring reliable and efficient data transmission. A queuing system model has been formulated based on traffic priorities, which is dependent on packet loss and delay. The traffic classes have been classified into four categories: loss-sensitive, critical (delay and loss-sensitive), delay-sensitive, and normal (delay-and-loss insensitive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. This classification enables the routing protocol to prioritize the transmission of high-priority traffic, such as critical and delay-sensitive traffic, over low-priority traffic, such as normal traffic.</p><p>To enable the selection of discontinuous pathways, packets with varying priority must be sent through on-demand routing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. In this study, the identified paths are grouped into four categories, namely normal, critical, delay-sensitive, and loss-sensitive, based on their total delay and link-expiration time (LET). The total end-to-end latency of a path is determined by the sum of all intermediate hop delays. To facilitate the routing process, each node maintains and updates a path table that contains the fields of path ID and the accumulated values of delay and LET towards the destination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p>

A bi-directional frame(b) and a predictor frame make up this class (p).</p><p>• Normal (Delay and Loss-insensitive): Essential monitoring data may be included in this class, which may necessitate offline processing.</p><p>• Storage videos, environmental data from scalar sensors, and snapshot multimedia material that's not time-critical are all instances of crucial media. This class is considered the least significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the queuing system model based on node-disjoint multipath routing, incorporating the four traffic classes: loss-sensitive, critical (delay and loss-sensitive), delay-sensitive, and normal (delay-and-loss insensitive) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. Nodes are capable of transmitting real-time traffic of multiple traffic classes, which are received through a receiving buffer queue cache for dissimilar types of inward traffic. To ensure efficient transmission, a priority scheduler is employed to direct the packets to the sending buffer queue in a suitable order based on the priorities of the real-time packets as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>A scheduler is employed to manage the packets in the sender buffer queue and transmit them through the route based on the situation of every disjoint path. At every relay node along the disjoint route, a queuing model is utilized in conjunction with priority to send real-time packets of varying priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p>

          <p>The selected traffic control scheme employs a priority scheduler to send the packets of various traffic classes based on their required priorities. Inbound real-time data packets are cached at the receiver buffer, and a classifier is used to monitor the class of the inbound packet and route it to the appropriate queue. In every transmission window, the scheduler determines the sequence of packets in the sender buffer queue based on their available priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>].</p>

      <title>4. Experimental results</title>
      <p>The proposed Enhanced QoS-Aware Multipath Routing Protocol (EQMRP) has been implemented in MATLAB, and its performance has been compared with the RTA-AODV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>] and traditional AODV routing protocols. The performance metrics evaluated in the study include end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, average packet drop, and average residual energy. These metrics enable the comparison of the proposed EQMRP protocol with existing routing protocols in terms of Quality of Service (QoS), network efficiency, and energy consumption.</p>

          <p>The performance analysis of the proposed Enhanced QoS-Aware Multipath Routing Protocol (EQMRP) and conventional routing methods has been carried out, with respect to several parameters as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>. The comparison is based on the evaluation of end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, packet drop, and residual energy. In this section, the results of varying nodes for the real-time traffic scenario are presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>].</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This paper proposes a method for controlling traffic in multi-path routing for the transmission of various Internet of Things (IoT) traffic classes with real-time applications. The proposed method is implemented using IoT to ensure dynamic and secured data sharing of real-time application data. The proposed method employs a disjoint multipath routing approach for transmitting various IoT traffic classes to ensure reliable and efficient data transmission. During on-demand routing, disjoint routes are selected to ensure packets with multiple priorities are transmitted according to the state. The discovered paths are grouped as Normal, Critical, Loss-sensitive, and Delay-sensitive, in accordance with the appropriate traffic class chosen for transmission. The proposed Enhanced QoS-Aware Multipath Routing Protocol (EQMRP) reduces the end-to-end delay with respect to node iterations. According to the simulation results, the proposed method demonstrates better performance compared to AODV (1.2%) and RTA-AODV (0.8%). The proposed method also shows better performance compared to conventional methods AODV (1.45%) and RTA-AODV (0.98%) with respect to packet delivery ratio and reduces packet drop compared to conventional methods AODV (1.16%) and RTA-AODV (0.75%). Moreover, the proposed method enhances residual energy compared to conventional methods AODV (1.05%) and RTA-AODV (0.85%). The proposed protocol has been simulated and validated using MATLAB. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed method exhibits better performance compared to conventional methods.</p><p>Future scope: The customer's trust is increased when the file gets communicated with multipath routing and with increased parallel operation without loss of information. at the same time, it will be capable to store in multi-cloud without any obstacles using this proposed method.</p><p>Limitations: In 6G communication technologies, the application will be sharing the data in 10000 Gb/s speed which requires high speed encryption and decryption process. The proposed method experiences attenuation and loss of information.</p>
