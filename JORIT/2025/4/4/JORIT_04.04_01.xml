      <abstract><p>Organizational commitment (OC) has gained popularity in recent times. It’s a very crucial determinant of employee retention, productivity, and a contributor to organizational growth and prosperity. The role of a faculty is very important in shaping the careers of students and in the overall growth of higher education institutions. The current study emphasizes how job-related factors like designation and demographic profiles like age, gender, education qualification, marital status, and area of belongingness affect OC of the faculty working in the HEIs of Uttarakhand, India. A simple random technique was used to determine the sample of the study; the sample of the study was 235 faculty members engaged in the higher education institutions (HEIs). 15 items were adapted from the questionnaire on OC developed by Mowday. To collect the data, an online questionnaire was sent to the faculty engaged in the HEIs through email and the WhatsApp application. To check the internal consistency, Cronbach's Alpha test was applied. The data were distributed normally, hence a parametric test was used. The study reveals that age, gender, experience, and marital status influence OC, and designation and area of belongingness have no impact on the OC. The policymakers need to develop strategies and policies keeping in mind both demographic and job-related factors to embrace and foster commitment amongst the employees.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Since 1950, organizational commitment (OC) has gained a lot of attention from both researchers and scientists. The interest of the researchers is also evident from the number of studies that have been published in the past across the world exploring the factors, determinants, antecedents, and outcomes of OC. Yet in many studies conducted in the past, major antecedents of OC remain unexplored. The growth and prosperity of any establishment are dependent on its employees of the establishment. Dedicated workmen are willing to contribute to the organization's well-being. Dedicated and committed workmen are ready to invest in the best innovative practices to grow the establishment. The commitment of employees is a crucial factor in achieving the objectives of the establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Atak &amp;amp; Erturgut, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Mathieu &amp;amp; Zajac, 1990</xref>). OC is an individual's involvement with the organisation he is associated with. The willingness of an individual to be associated with the organization is regarded as OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Mowday et al., 1979</xref>). It is the exchange between the employee and the organization where an employee is willing to contribute towards the establishment, and benefit the establishment is regarded as a commitment of the employees towards the establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Singh &amp;amp; Gupta, 2015</xref>). OC is the individual’s involvement with the establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Lorber &amp;amp; Skela-Savič, 2014</xref>). Commitment is the orientation of an individual to be associated with the organization, their strong belief in the organization’s vision and mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Buttner &amp;amp; Lowe, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A three-component model in the year 1990 was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Meyer &amp;amp; Allen (1991)</xref> on OC. They stated in their model that there are three dimensions/components of OC, i.e., affective commitment (AC), normative commitment (NC) and continuance commitment (CC). AC is the emotional connection of an employee with the organization, NC is when an employee feels that it's morally not right to leave the organization, and CC is when an employee has no opportunity outside which is why he is committed towards the organization.</p>

      <title>2. Review of literature</title>
      <p>Organizational commitment in many research articles has been treated as a dependent variable. Also, it's an important factor that determines the growth of the organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Meyer et al. (2002)</xref> explained OC as the extent to which an employee is able to identify himself with the organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Becker (1960)</xref> stated that it’s an individual’s willingness to invest their energy in the organization. Job performance and OC are strongly and positively correlated, whereas tiredness and absenteeism are negatively related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Hom et al., 1979</xref>). The phenomenon of binding the individual with the behavioral act is commitment, defined in the early 60s. In the year 1979, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Mowday et al. (1979)</xref> stated that OC has three major components, i.e., 1) trust in the organization’s objectives and goals, 2) desire to be associated with the organization, and 3) willingness to contribute to the organization’s goals and objectives.</p><p>OC was later viewed as a three-component concept by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Meyer &amp;amp; Allen (1997)</xref>. The model comprises three components, namely AC, NC, and CC. AC refers to an employee's emotional bond with the company, NC is the individual’s obligation to be associated with the organization, and lastly, CC has to do with how much it costs to leave the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Dodd-McCue &amp;amp; Wright, 1996</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.1. Relationships between organizational commitment, job-related factors, and demographics</title>
          
          <p>Historically, there has been a positive and substantial correlation between OC and demographic characteristics like age, marital status, gender, and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Luthans et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Marsden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Yucel &amp;amp; Bektas, 2012</xref>). Socio-demographic variables are very crucial factors in social research and psychology. The correlation between OC and age has been explored in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Srivastava &amp;amp; Tang, 2015</xref>). It was revealed that age has a substantial and strong influence on the continuance commitment. Studies conducted in the past revealed that gender and educational qualification a moderator variable between OC and transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Mathieu &amp;amp; Zajac, 1990</xref>). Tenure, length of service or experience, and OC have a strong relationship and positively correlate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ahmad &amp;amp; Bakar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Amangala, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Aven et al., 1993</xref>). Demographic factors and job-related factors are the most studied factors across the world.</p>

            <title>2.2. Effects of organizational commitment and gender</title>
          
          <p>Investigation of the role of age in influencing OC is dependent on two different types of models, i.e., the gender model and the job model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akinyemi, 2014</xref>). Gender model stated that both men and women display different extents of OC, whereas the job model stated that regardless of the employee's gender, those who are associated with the same work culture, environment show comparable commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kura et al., 2012</xref>). Though extensive research has been conducted to explore the exchange between gender and OC, there is still no clarity. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Dodd-McCue &amp;amp; Wright (1996)</xref> stated that gender has a strong impact on OC. It was also revealed that women are more committed and loyal towards their work, possibly because the organizational policies support females to balance both their personal as well as professional life as compared to the male employees, whereas, in another study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Amangala (2013)</xref>, gender has no significant impact on OC. Another study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ajayi (2017)</xref> stated that females in the banking sector are more committed than the male employees because of socio-economic reasons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Loscocco (1989)</xref> stated that male employees are more committed as compared to female employees because males have a positive attitude towards the authority, and the work-related attitude is positive. Females may feel discriminated against in the workplace can be a possible reason for low levels of OC. The findings of studies from the past can be potentially attributed to the inadequate representation of the respondents from the education sector.</p>

            <title>2.3. Effects of organizational commitment and marital status</title>
          
          <p>In the past study, it was concluded that unmarried employees are less committed than married employees. It was also concluded that married employees seek job security and want to be associated with the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kura et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, support from a companion, stability and security that a relationship provides, companionship, and emotional support from the partner help in improving the mental well-being of an individual, which boosts the morale of an individual to be associated with the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Gómez-López et al., 2019</xref>). However, in another study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Popoola (2009)</xref>, it was stated that there is no influence or strong impact of marital status on OC.</p>

            <title>2.4. Effects of organizational commitment and age</title>
          
          <p>Age is the most significant antecedent of OC; some researchers in the past have revealed that age significantly affects OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akinyemi, 2014</xref>). Employees who are old have strong affective commitment, whereas young employees are more career oriented and in search of better opportunities that can benefit them. However, a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Aven et al. (1993)</xref> stated that young employees are more committed and dedicated towards their roles and responsibilities and are also ready to deliver more because of the peer pressure, mental pressure, and urge to grow in their careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Grundström et al., 2021</xref>), making them more committed as compared to the senior employees.</p>

          <p>Some researchers in the past have revealed that experience has a strong impact on OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Kura et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Poudel (2024)</xref> in his research revealed that with long tenure in an organization experience a high extent of OC as employees develop attachment towards their organization because of the long duration of time that they have spent in the organization, also the organization must have been very supportive that’s why the employees can sustain in the organization, were treated fairly therefore the employees are more dedicated and committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Angelis et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.6. Research gap</title>
          
          <p>Existing studies conducted in the Western and other countries in Asia provide mixed results, suggesting that demographic variables contribute to and affect OC. Yet, findings and results are contradictory. For instance, older employees are more committed and have a high extent of affective commitment, whereas in other studies, it was found it have no significant effect on OC. Similarly, in the case of commitment among both males and females, there’s a debate, also the results are inconsistent. These discrepancies in the result emphasize the need for the study, which should be culture-specific and region-specific, that can capture the unique socio-cultural realities of the HEIs of North India. HEIs in North India face a lot of challenges, which include limited opportunities for growth, poor infrastructure, lack of motivation, and poor retention rate of the faculty. These problems are often compounded by both demographic and job-related factors that affect the level of attachment of the faculty with the HEIs. Institutions can frame policies to foster OC in the HEIs if these demographic and job-related factors are strongly connected with the OC. Absence of such insights often leads to poor dedication of the employees, poor morale of the faculty, which results in poor performance of the institutions. The study aims to identify the specific demographic factors that can help in improving the dedication of the employees in the HEIs.</p>

            <title>2.7. Problem statement</title>
          
          <p>HEIs play a very crucial role in the social and economic development of North India. HEIs face a lot of challenges in retaining their faculty. OC is the emotional and psychological attachment of a workman with their organization. Low morale, absenteeism, poor retention, and turnover are common problems faced by the faculty in the HEIs of North India, which can adversely affect the goodwill and image of the HEIs, poor research and teaching output, and ineffective and poor performance of the HEIs because of low OC of the faculty. In the past, many studies have been conducted to explore OC, but there remain gaps that investigating how demographic and job-related factors can influence OC. Differences in the organizational norms, organizational culture, and career aspects may affect different demographic groups to exhibit different patterns of dedication and commitment. Also, Uttarakhand has witnessed tremendous growth in number of HEIs which has made the demography of the state large, this has moderated the effect of organizational policies on how an employee feel for example younger faculty is more career oriented and ready to learn new things, or faculty from rural area might feel a strong inclination to stay back in the urban area for a better standard of living, married employees are more dedicated towards their job responsibility as they have to support their family as well. Demography-related and job-related factors affect OC to a great extent, thus forcing the policy makers to design and implement such policies that can cater to the different requirements of the employee coming from different backgrounds, cultures and experiences that can foster and embrace organizational commitment.</p>

            <title>3.2. Research methodology</title>
          
          <p>This study investigates the impact of demographic factors and job-related factors on the OC of the faculty engaged in Uttarakhand's HEIs, particularly from Dehradun, Rishikesh, Haridwar, and Champawat. To ascertain the objective of the study, both primary and secondary data were used. Secondary data was collected from the SCOPUS database. To refine the search specific keyword “Organizational Commitment” was used, limiting the research to only social science, business management and accounting, and psychology, with a defined time frame between 2000 to 2025. The study was not country-specific, and the language chosen was English. To ensure the quality of the papers, only research papers with high citations were selected. A simple random technique was used as a sampling technique. An online questionnaire was distributed to 300 faculty members working in the Higher Education Institutes of Uttarakhand through email and WhatsApp. Out of which 65 responses were incomplete, and had missing responses of the questions asked; hence were removed from the sample considered for the study. Therefore, only 235 faculty members were selected to fill the response of 15 items adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Mowday et al. (1979)</xref> scale of OC. Mowday scale was adapted in preference to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Meyer &amp;amp; Allen (1991)</xref> scale because of its clear and simple concepts, conceptual congruence with the objectives of this study, empirical robustness, and high internal reliability above 0.85. This scale has been adapted by many researchers in the past who have conducted similar studies in the education sector from across the world. In this study, demographic variables and job-related variables are being analysed; hence, it’s important to capture the overall commitment rather than the underlying motives. Whereas the result of normative and continuance commitment varies, it can also be inconsistent and can affect the overall results. In many studies conducted in the past, continuance commitment negatively correlates with OCB if the Meyer and Allen scale is adapted. Therefore, Mowday's scale of OC was adapted. The data was distributed normally, as the mean value of all the items of the scale of the variables was 3.1 to 3.8; therefore, a parametric test was used to examine the data. To confirm the internal consistency of the data, Cronbach's Alpha test was applied, and the value was 0.880, greater than the threshold value of 0.7.</p>

This can be possible because females also have to take care of the household work as well, look after the family and children and therefore the commitment level of males is higher than that of females. The sample size of the study is balanced, the one-tailed P-value is 0.024, which is less than 0.05; thus null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. Thus, there is a statistically significant difference between males' and females' commitment.

Married employees can’t leave the job easily, as family is also one of the constraints due to which them can’t leave the organization in search of a better opportunity. Also, it is observed that the difference is statistically significant in a one-tailed test.

It can also be interpreted that Professors are more committed, as the mean value is 4.09, whereas assistant professors experience it the least.

      <p>The current study examined the effect of demographic and job-related factors on OC of the faculty in the HEIs of Uttarakhand in North India, since individuals differ from each other in terms of commitment level. This research study stated a difference between the OC of male and female faculty working in the different HEIs of Uttarakhand. In this study, it has been revealed that males are more committed than female employees, also supported by a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Loscocco (1989)</xref>, who reported that males are more committed as compared to female employees working in the service sector of Ghana. There's a possible reason that there is a difference in the level of commitment between male and female employees, as females are often occupied with household work as well, which makes them more committed towards family responsibilities. However, in the past, studies have also concluded that women are more committed as compared to male employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Dodd-McCue &amp;amp; Wright, 1996</xref>). The difference in the commitment level among males and females can be explained because of the cultural influence, educational background, interactions, and biological factors. Another finding of the study suggests that age has a substantial impact on OC. These findings are supported by the results presented in a study conducted by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Elizur &amp;amp; Koslowsky (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Rampal et al. (2023)</xref>. In the current study, it was revealed that faculty members between 25 and 35 years of age experience a high level of OC. This is because young individuals are willing to prove themselves in the workplace and face peer pressure to perform better. Whereas, it can be observed that length of service has no significant impact on OC it can be inferred from the study that faculty with 0-10 experience at their respective workplace have a high extent of OC they are often motivated to get promotions, rewards, and recognition in the organizations they are associated with, employees look for stable career and economic stability at their workplace, employees focus on building their reputation at the workplace, and dedication for their respective roles and responsibilities in the organization, their keen interest in building their professional networks that can improve the reputation of their institutions by participating in seminars and conferences and delivering quality research output hence they are more dedicated and committed towards their roles and responsibilities which encourages and embrace OC. Marital status is a very important demographic factor of OC. A stable relationship can enhance productivity at work, boost the morale of an individual and urge an individual to be more focused at the workplace. In this study, marital status has a significant impact on the OC of the faculty. It can be observed that married employees are more committed as compared to unmarried employees. However, designation has no substantial influence on OC. However, a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Angelis et al. (2011)</xref> stated that people working in the service sector in Ghana occupy the highest designation when they are highly occupied, which enhances organisational commitment. Another inference drawn from the study is area of belongingness has no substantial impact on OC.</p><p>These findings of the studies can be connected with the international literature on HEIs underline both context-specific dynamics and commonalities. Studies conducted globally show mixed results of demographic-related and job-related factors on the OC. Some research articles reveal a strong effect of age, length of service, gender and marital status on the OC, reinforcing that the demographic factors interact with the institutional culture, policies, and also the labor market conditions. The present study aligns with the international studies conducted in European, Asian, and North American universities, which suggested that promotion at the workplace, mentoring of the employees, timely training of the employees, and strong companionship with the life partner bolsters organisational commitment. Also, policies that encourage a healthy work-life balance can also reduce the risk of labour turnover. Likewise, urban-rural disparities also support the international literature and can be overcome if the institutions can invest in the infrastructure and develop a professional network that can encourage faculty engagement.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The present study investigated how demographic factors are responsible is affecting the OC of the faculty in the HEIs of Uttarakhand, known for its rich heritage and culture. The region is currently undergoing a huge and positive transformation in the education sector, as many new HEIs and universities have been established in the region. It can be observed that demographic factors like age, area of belongingness, designation, marital status, designation, and gender exert meaningful effects on the dedication of the faculty engaged in the HEIs. The influence of these demographic factors varies in direction and magnitude of the dedication experienced by different faculty. It's also connected with the faculty's personal characteristics, such as life stage and career stage.</p><p>One of the most important insight from the study is that age has a significant impact on the OC of the faculty it can be observed from the study that faculty aged between 25–35 years are more committed, as they are keen to learn new things, develop their skills, and also want to prove their worth in the organization they are associated with. It can also be seen that males are more committed as compared to the female faculty working in the HEIs also, gender has a substantial effect on the OC, marital status of the employees is also a very influential and crucial factor of influencing OC, it can be observed that the married employees are more committed as they have family responsibilities they try to fulfill their job responsibilities and work hard so that they are able to secure their jobs in the private setups. It can also be observed that both designation and area of belongingness both have no significant effect on the OC of the faculty of the HEIs of North India. These findings play a very crucial role for the employer, administrators and the policy makers to frame and implement HR policies keeping in mind the effect of these demographic factor that can shape and foster OC in the HEIs.</p>

      <title>6. Recommendations</title>
      <p>India’s education sector is the third largest after America and China in terms of the number of HEIs and the students enrolled in the HEIs. This study highlights the importance of OC in the education sector. Due to a lot of challenges, it's difficult for the HEIs to foster and embrace OC among the faculty of the HEIs. Both demographic and job-related factors play a very important role in shaping commitment amongst the employees in the different sectors. It's challenging for HR practitioners to embrace commitment, talent management, and employee engagement. This investigation can aid the policy makers in framing and personalizing policies according to the demographics of the employees engaged in the organization. Career development programs can be initiated by the HEIS this will encourage commitment. Similarly, HEIs should support the faculty in research, like participating in conferences and seminars, providing financial assistance to the faculty for participating in workshops and different faculty development programs, which can encourage the young enthusiasts. Similarly, senior employees can give their valuable inputs, ideas, and suggestions to the administration of the HEIs for improving the quality of the education programs and introducing new courses and programs, which will certainly encourage the senior employees to be more committed. Also, retention package and clarity in the career path for the mid-career employees, which can help in lowering the stress of the employees regarding being retained by the HEIs in the long run, and bolster emotional attachment with the organisation. Reducing infrastructure inequalities between urban and rural campuses through faculty exchange programs can also embrace OC among the faculty. Flexibility of the work timings should be encouraged this will promote healthy work-life balance, which will be appreciated not only by the young employees but also by the senior faculty. Recognising the efforts of the faculty, like the ones who maintain excellent quality of teaching and deliver good research output, who help their colleagues at the workplace, exhibit citizenship behaviour, will feel a part of the organisation and will be dedicated for the HEIs. Also, recreational activities should be organised from time and again so that the faculty can also be relaxed at the same time. Faculty development programs can also be organised so that the faculty can learn new skills and abilities that can be delivered in classroom training. This will encourage the faculty to enhance their abilities and skills and develop new concepts that can improve their classroom teaching. This will help them build a strong relationship with the students and earn respect, which is fulfilling in itself. Faculty involved in the HEI's administrative work, like maintaining paper work, participating in the counselling of the students, taking extra classes, maintaining students' record, etc. should be recognised by the higher management and should be given incentives so that they are encouraged to be a part of the organization and also will be ready to deliver beyond their set roles and responsibilities. Timely performance appraisal, restrooms, play area dedicated only to the faculty, autonomy in academic decision making, updated digital libraries, full equipped laboratories, access to both national and international journals, sense of financial security by providing pensions and gratuity to the faculty at the time of retirement, timely feedback, positive organizational culture, healthy work environment, manageable teaching loads, strong and progressive HR policies, and career growth of faculty in the HEIs can embrace OC, which can help HEIs to prosper and grow, meet the global competition, and also help in creating a strong talent pool of faculty in the HEIs. If the employees are committed, it will certainly lower the absenteeism rate, improve the retention rate, and the HEIs will be able to maintain a good reputation and also be profitable.</p>

      <title>7. Limitations and the future scope of the study</title>
      <p>The current study has several limitations. Firstly, the study is limited to Higher education institutions only from the education sector; primary education is not considered from the same sector; hence, the findings of the study cannot be generalised. Secondly, the sample of the study is limited to only 235 faculty; the administration staff is not considered for the study. Hence, the findings of the study cannot be generalised. The study is limited only to the education sector, so the conclusion drawn from the study cannot be generalized. The study was limited to the impact of only demographic and job-related factors; other factors, like transformational leadership, organizational support, organizational justice, workplace spirituality, and organizational culture, can also be considered as variables to study the impact on OC. This study did not consider salary as a demographic-related factor, which plays a very important role in shaping commitment among employees; hence, in the future, salary can also be considered as a determinant that can affect the OC of the employees. Certainly, workplace environment, HR policies, organizational structure, and culture play a very crucial role in enhancing the commitment of the employees; thus, in future studies, these factors can also be considered. In the future, other sectors like transportation, banking, tourism, hospitality, medical, etc., can be considered for the study. In the future, the study can be conducted in a different state of India or can be conducted in different countries to develop a better understanding of embracing commitment.</p>
