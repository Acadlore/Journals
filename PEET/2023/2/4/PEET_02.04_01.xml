      <abstract><p>In the design of shell and tube heat exchangers encompassing a condensing zone, meticulous attention is required due to the complexities surrounding forced convection in multiphase systems. Despite extensive research, the intricacies within these multiphase systems have remained elusive, rendering the heat transfer coefficient unresolved. In this study, a novel methodology is introduced to elucidate the thermal characteristics of forced convection within the condensing region of shell and tube condensers. An amalgamation of theoretical methods, specifically the Logarithmic Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD), and empirical data sourced from industrial operations forms the foundation of this approach. Upon rigorous analysis employing both Power Law Analysis and Logarithmic Linear Regression, a correlation in terms of ${N_u}=C \cdot {Re}^m \cdot {Pr}^{\mathrm{n}}$ within the condensing region was discerned using Buckingham Pi Theorem. Findings revealed coefficients of C=1.15, m=0.893, and n=13.442. For optimization purposes, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm was employed. A focused examination of parameters such as tube length, tube outside diameter, baffle spacing, shell diameter, number of tube passings, and tube wall thickness revealed that by attenuating their values by 30%, 46%, 80.3%, 8%, 50%, and 61.9% respectively, a substantial increase in condenser effectiveness was observed, elevating the value from 0.9473 to 4.299.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Heat exchange through forced convection, a mechanism driven by devices such as pumps and compressors, has been established as a critical process across various industrial applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Within this realm, heat exchangers play an instrumental role, with the shell and tube variety emerging as the most prevalent. However, while theoretical methods including LMTD and Number of Transfer Units (NTU) have been reviewed and applied for designing such exchangers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], challenges arise when forced convection interfaces with multiphase fluids. The intricate nature of multiphase processes has, thus far, obfuscated precise definitions of the heat transfer coefficient. A notable instance of this complexity is manifested in the condensing regions of shell and tube condensers, employed across industries ranging from batteries to nuclear power plants. Consequently, there remains a pressing need to articulate a method that effectively characterizes forced convection, especially within condensing regions.</p><p>The design intricacies of multiphase shell and tube heat exchangers, pivotal in industrial settings, necessitate meticulous attention to attributes such as working fluid temperature, heat flow rate, and condenser geometry. The inherent complexity of multiphase flows stems from the concurrent presence of disparate phases, each bearing unique mechanical and chemical attributes. This multifaceted nature is further amplified by the diverse parameters impacting both efficiency and the overarching economic viability of industrial operations.</p><p>The Lattice Boltzmann Methods, for instance, have been employed to decipher multiphase flows, as highlighted in studies like that of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Such methods, adaptable to both theoretical and numerical scenarios, offer promise. Notably, a two-pronged approach, blending both numerical and experimental methodologies, has been underscored for its precision in several works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>Amid the array of potential optimizations, a consistent focus has been the pursuit of heightened effectiveness within shell and tube condensers. Empirical evidence from research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] suggests the viability of parameter optimization as a conduit for bolstered production at reduced costs. Within this optimization landscape, the PSO algorithm has garnered attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Defined as a technique that iteratively refines solutions (or particles) against a quality benchmark, the PSO algorithm modulates particle movement within the problem space predicated on specified functions governing particle position and velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Its merits lie in its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation relative to other numerical methodologies.</p><p>At its core, the condensing zone within a shell and tube condenser represents a pivotal region. Situated within the shell component, this zone witnesses the heat medium transitioning from vapor to its condensed form, thereby transferring heat to the cooling medium within the tube. This interaction propels forced convection, leading the cooler fluid in the tubes to heat and vaporize. The resultant vapor, post-condensation, reverts to condensate water, which, in turn, can be repurposed for varied industrial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Given the centrality of this process, the ability to precisely design and predict heat transfer characteristics within the condensing zone is of paramount importance.</p><p>This study aims to present a method that not only characterizes multiphase forced convective heat transfer but also leverages the PSO algorithm to optimize heat exchanger effectiveness within the condensing zone of shell and tube condensers. The overarching intent is to streamline the calculation of general thermal performance within the condensing zone of such condensers.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>The present study is divided into two primary objectives. Firstly, the heat transfer characteristic within the condensing zone of the shell and tube condenser is elucidated. Secondly, an optimization of the condenser effectiveness is pursued.</p>

      <p>In the preliminary segment, a proposed technique for discerning the heat transfer characteristic is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. Utilizing a blend of empirical and theoretical data, the heat transfer characteristic was analyzed. Data for this analysis was extracted from operational records of a shell and tube condenser in an industrial setting spanning three months. It was observed that saturated steam, in the condensing zone, flowed within the shell and was subsequently condensed by water flowing through the tube banks. The condensed medium was identified to be pure vapor, leading to an assumption that heat transfer occurs at the saturation temperature within the shell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. For the purposes of this study, no heat dissipation was assumed.</p><p>Even though saturated steam, a two-phase fluid, is prevalently utilized as a heating medium in industrial processes, complexities inherent in multiphase phenomena render the heat transfer characteristic somewhat elusive. The current research introduces an advanced and straightforward technique to determine the forced convective heat transfer characteristic within the condensing zone of shell and tube condensers. This characteristic is represented by an average convection heat transfer coefficient, symbolized as <inline-formula>

      <p>For the empirical approach, a correlation was established between the dependent <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> and both <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic>. Initially assessed through the Buckingham Pi Theorem (20), this theorem encompasses all parameters inherent in the heat transfer formula, both dependent and independent. For the shell and tube heat exchanger, the theorem designates empirical dimensional parameters that may influence the heat exchanger's behavior, such as flow velocity, density, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, dynamic viscosity, water convection heat transfer coefficient, and tube diameter.

            <title>2.1. Parameters of convective heat transfer</title>
          
          <p>The convective heat transfer coefficient, representing the heat transfer between the fluid in the shell and the fluid in the tube within the condensing zone of a condenser, was extensively analyzed. For this examination, both empirical and theoretical evaluations were harmoniously integrated. Empirical data was sourced from an industrial case study, where water functioned as the working fluid on both the shell and tube sides. Such a dual-method approach, combining empirical and theoretical analyses, mirrors the methodological foundations explored by Gunes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. In his research, forced convection heat transfer characteristics in water flowing inside and outside a laboratory-scaled double pipe heat exchanger tube were investigated. With the employment of a pump, water was introduced into the heat exchanger, leading to the manifestation of forced convection heat transfer.</p><p>In the empirical approach adopted here, mechanical properties data was derived using film temperature. This temperature was calculated based on the inlet and outlet temperatures of both steam and water. A consistent temperature was maintained by the steam within the tubes throughout the process. The surface temperature of these tubes was assumed to mirror the temperature of the water circulating within them. An assumption was made that conduction was absent in the system, due to the tube walls being perceived as exceptionally thin. Furthermore, the tube surface temperature was posited to be an average of the temperatures at the inlet and outlet sections. Consequently, <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic> were defined based on film temperature, which was predicated on the consistent steam temperature and the average water temperature.</p><p>Highlighting the correlation of dimensionless numbers is pivotal in comprehending the forced convection heat transfer characteristic. This analytical pathway has been previously treaded upon by Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. His research emphasized forced convection in crossflow involving thin circular isothermal fins within tubes. Dimensionless parameters, <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic>, which were functions of <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>, were extracted from simulation outcomes generated by the Ansys FLUENT software. Mathematical methods, such as curve-fitting procedures, were subsequently applied to procure correlations of dimensionless numbers for both circular fins and tube walls. Through the application of Logarithmic Linear Regression Analysis, a distinct correlation of dimensionless numbers, encapsulating the characteristics of forced convection heat transfer on a sphere, was deduced. Such methodology was emulated in the present study, focusing on the characteristics of forced convection within the condensing zone of an industrial condenser.</p>

            <title>2.2. Mathematical procedures for analyzing convective heat transfer characteristics</title>
          
          <p>In this research, a methodological approach was undertaken to deduce heat transfer characteristics, specifically expressing <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> as a function of <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic>. The Buckingham <italic>Pi </italic>Theorem, a renowned method for dimensional analysis, was employed to derive the heat transfer formula. Recognized for its capacity to streamline the complexity of experimental variables, the Buckingham <italic>Pi </italic>Theorem succinctly aggregates these variables into dimensionless parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].

</inline-formula>,<italic> v</italic>, and <italic>D</italic>, are consolidated into three primary dimensionless numbers: <italic>Re</italic>, <italic>Pr</italic>, and <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>. Such a grouping simplifies the correlation discovery process among these parameters, as elaborated in Eq. (4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>Subsequent to this formulation, an assessment was conducted by plotting the three aforementioned dimensionless numbers on a unified graph. Similar procedures were reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. The analysis incorporates Logarithmic Linear Regression, Curve Fitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], and Power Law Analysis. Notably, Melissari and Argyropoulos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] utilized Logarithmic Linear Regression to determine heat transfer characteristics. In their investigation, a correlation of dimensionless numbers, consisting of <italic>Re</italic>, <italic>Pr</italic>, and <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>, was formed. Experiments with liquid sodium and water flowing over spherical entities were executed. By plotting log <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> against log <italic>Re</italic> and log <italic>Pr </italic>individually, a correlation anchored on logarithmic linear regression was deduced, elucidating the relationship between <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>, <italic>Re</italic>, and <italic>Pr</italic>. Noteworthy parallels were observed between theoretical predictions and experimental findings.</p><p>Logarithmic linear regression, a transformative technique, converts a given function into a correlation with logarithmic values along both x and y axes. Originating from logarithmic transformation values, this method renders both independent and dependent variables in logarithmic forms. This transformation often becomes indispensable when non-linear relationships exist between dependent and independent variables. In such scenarios, the logarithmic form retains the linearity of the model while capturing the non-linear relationships.</p><p>In this analysis, <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic> were plotted, with each being a function of <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>. Once plotted using logarithmic regression analysis, the relationship of <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> to both <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic> was delineated. The correlation was structured to position the dependent variable in relation to an independent variable, holding other independent variables constant. With two independent variables present, two distinct correlations were visualized, each presenting <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> as the dependent variable. The initial plot, which treated <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> as a dependent variable against <italic>Re</italic>, yielded the function <italic>Re<sup>m</sup></italic>. The subsequent plot, which contrasted <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> with <italic>Pr</italic>, followed an analogous process and yielded the function <italic>Pr<sup>n</sup></italic>. When these dependent variables were plotted against a combination of independent variables, a constant (C) in the heat transfer characteristic formula emerged.</p><p>To conclude, the formula, denoting <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic> as dependent variables, was employed to ascertain the heat transfer characteristic <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>. In this phase, the estimated heat transfer characteristic was labeled <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic> empiric. Concurrently, an empirical heat transfer coefficient, denoted <inline-formula>

For the purpose of data collection, inlet and outlet temperatures from both zones, as well as the mass flow rate, were recorded, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. Within the condenser, heat disperses and is subsequently transferred to the cooling water within the tubes. As water vapor enters the condensing zone's inlet on the shell side, it undergoes condensation, releasing heat.

Solutions, referred to as particles, are continually recalculated using specific functions associated with the position and velocity of said particles. The provisional best solution found thus far influences the movement of the particles. As a result, the collective set of particles, known as a swarm, ultimately converges upon the final best solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>Within the PSO framework, agents, termed particles, traverse the search space in pursuit of the optimal solution. Each particle's trajectory is adjusted in accordance with both its own experience and the cumulative experience of the entire swarm. The three pivotal parameters for each particle include its current position, velocity, and the best position it has previously attained. The particle with the highest fitness value is acknowledged as the global best position. As the swarm progresses, solutions are dynamically altered with a potential shift toward a region that holds promise for the global optimum. Notably, the speed at which a particle travels is dynamically adjusted based on the collective experiences of the swarm. Both personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest; gb) values are maintained for each particle. The alteration in a particle's position is contingent upon several factors: its current position, current velocity, the discrepancy between its present position and pbest (pb), and the variance between its current position and gbest. The velocity equation for the particles is given by Eq. (5), and the new position of the particles is derived using Eq. (6).</p>

      <p>In the present research, the primary objective of employing the PSO algorithm lies in determining the optimal value of the condenser's geometric parameters. The algorithm's application aims to ascertain a combination of these parameters that bolsters the condenser's efficiency, keeping within pressure drop constraints in both the shell and tube, based on design data. Parameters chosen for optimization encompass tube length (Lt), tube outside diameter (tube OD), baffle spacing (B), shell diameter (Ds), number of tube passes (Np), and tube wall thickness (tw). These parameters were deemed crucial due to their independence from other geometric variables and their conformance to standard value ranges. Apart from enhancing the effectiveness value, solutions derived from the PSO algorithm are constrained to neither surpass nor diminish the design pressure drop values in the shell (<inline-formula>

          <p>To scrutinize Eq. (15), mathematical methodologies such as Logarithmic Linear Regression Analysis, Power Law, and Curve Fitting were employed. Through these, the formula characterizing heat transfer, in terms of <italic>Re</italic>, <italic>Pr</italic>, and <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>, was resolved, leading to the determination of the power constants (n and m) as well as the constant C. Using the mechanical properties extracted from the empirical data of a specific industrial case, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>, <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>Pr</italic> were computed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates a graph depicting log (<italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>) as a function of log (<italic>Re</italic>). For the discernment of the trend line within this logarithmic graph, curve fitting was applied.</p><p>An analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> reveals a correlation coefficient of 0.893 (m = 0.893) between the independent variable Re and the dependent variable <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>. This suggests a proportional relationship between <italic>Re</italic> and <italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>, albeit with the increase in Re not significantly amplifying the heat transfer process (exponential/power to 0.893). An upsurge in Re might potentially be attributed to escalated water velocities or temperature variations on both fronts.</p><p>A secondary data set was formulated through manipulation of Eq. (4), whereby the parameter of log (<italic>N<sub>u</sub></italic>) divided by log (<italic>Pr</italic>) was represented as a function of the corresponding <italic>Re</italic>. This relationship is visually depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. From the same figure, the power of n was determined to be 13.442, with C established at 1.15. Substituting the values of C, m, and n into Eq. (4), the equation was reframed as:</p>

Comparisons with the design data reveal reductions in the values of Lt by 30.5246%, tube OD by 46.1049%, B by 80.2861%, Ds by 7.9979%, np by 50%, and tw by 61.9%.</p><p>The enhancement in <inline-formula>
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

</inline-formula> was attributed to the reduction in B size. A decrease in B size was correlated with increased steam turbulence within the shell. The number of baffles (nb) influences the heat transfer process duration. A rise in nb was found to extend the heat transfer time, thereby elevating effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. This, in turn, amplified the Reynolds number (Re) of the steam, resulting in increased convective coefficients and <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> was attributed to the B size exceeding the TEMA standard's minimum B value.

Shorter fluid pathways, combined with a diminished tube wall thickness, were inferred to limit frictional forces between cooling water and the tube wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>].

These shifts instigated alterations in other parameters due to interdependencies among the geometric data. As a result, the condenser maintained adherence to existing design standards.

Specifically, variations were noted in the tube inner diameter (tube ID), clearance between the tube bundle and shell (Lbb), the outer diameter limit (Dotl), the outer dimension of the tube bank (Dctl), the number of tubes (nt), the equivalent diameter (De), the number of baffles (nb), the clearance between tubes within the tube bundle (C'), the tube pitch (PT), and the flow area traversing the tube bundle (as). These observed modifications align with the TEMA standard, with the adjustments in Lt, tube OD, B, Ds, np, and tw remaining within the stipulated ranges: 3.048 m – 6.096 m for Lt; 0.0064 m – 0.0508 m for tube OD; 1.09728 m – 1.3716 m for B; 2.057 m – 2.54 m for Ds; 2 to 8 pieces for np; and 0.0004572 m – 0.004572 m for tw.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In the presented research, empirical and theoretical methodologies were developed to elucidate the forced convection heat transfer characteristics within the condensing region of the shell and tube heat exchanger. Employing the Buckingham Pi Theorem, three dimensionless parameters pertinent to heat transfer were derived. Subsequent application of Logarithmic Regression Analysis, Power Law Analysis, and Curve fitting Analysis facilitated the identification of power constants. As a result, the following relationship was established:</p><p>\[N_u=1.15 \cdot {Re}^{0.893} \cdot {Pr}^{13.442}\]</p><p>Furthermore, optimization of the effectiveness within a specific pressure drop range in both the shell and tubes was achieved through the implementation of the PSO method. Following this optimization, a marked increase in effectiveness was observed, registering a value of 4.299, a significant ascent from the initial 0.9473.</p><p>The findings underscore the potential of integrating theoretical and empirical approaches in understanding and enhancing the performance of heat exchangers. Future investigations might delve deeper into the broader implications of these methodologies, particularly in varied operational conditions.</p>
