      <abstract><p>Seed Quality is an important area of agriculture and directly influences crop yield and germination percentage. Visual examination forms the foundation of traditional seed testing techniques, which are cumbersome, inflexible, and inefficient for effective assessment. This study proposed an automated approach to seed quality assessment based on physical measurement using machine learning and image processing techniques. Snapshots of the new seeds were captured and underwent feature extraction, segmentation, and image improvement to explore notable morphological attributes, such as size and colour. To tag seeds as "good" or "bad" based on physical characteristics, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used as a reference model. Rather, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been utilised for deep feature extraction and classification. Experimental findings indicate that CNNs perform better than conventional machine learning models, with a scalable and highly accurate method of seed quality assessment. Future use will utilise quantum machine learning to improve prediction and facilitate sustainable, precision agriculture. The improved framework, optimised with great care for onion seeds, is a major breakthrough in increasing the agricultural productivity of onion cultivation.</p></abstract>

      <title>2. Overview of seed quality assessment</title>
      <p>The good quality of seed is one of the most important factors in the performance of agriculture, which mainly manifests directly by affecting the final crop yield and sustainable management.

However, the novel developments in machine learning (ML) and image processing allow for the revolution of seed quality analysis with their efficient, accurate, and automated solutions.</p>

          <p>Machine learning methods are widely used in various applications in the food industry, such as detecting diseases, predicting yields, and testing food quality. In particular, supervised learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Convolutional Neural Networks, are very effective for classification tasks such as determining seed quality. These algorithms study the labelled dataset patterns and then are able to be used in previously revealed data, which is a remarkable base for automated decision-making.</p><p>For example, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Santos et al. (2020)</xref> has shown that DL can achieve high accuracy in detecting and classifying defects in seeds and fruits when applied to datasets in agriculture.

          <p>This study builds on previous research by integrating advanced ML algorithms with precise image processing techniques tailored to onion seed quality assessment. Unlike studies that focus on specific grains or fruits, this work addresses the challenges associated with onion seeds. While methodologies are consistent with state-of-the-art practices, including features like seed width and height with high-resolution imaging sets this study apart.

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the analysis of the seed quality parameter identification, starting with a single image of nine seeds. The previous steps were to convert the image to a standard input size, adjust the pixel values to determine the standard measurement of seed, and use the augmentation technique to increase the data level.</p>

      <p>After preprocessing, a model is selected that matches the expected seed physical parameters, and the data is divided into training and testing sets for training and evaluating the model. The modelâs performance in classifying or analyzing seed quality is cross-validated with the seeds' physical measurements. The model output helps in identifying the best seeds (âgood seedsâ) that can be used as a good farmer saved seeds. Through this systematic approach, a robust and systematic analysis of onion seeds can be provided. </p>

            <title>3.1. Dataset preparation</title>
          
          <p>The data set comprised 9 onion seeds harvested from a farm, with an assortment of broken, mid-sized, and big seeds for variability. The seeds were captured under controlled illumination using a 1x magnifying camera in a stationary experimental setup to provide consistent brightness and contrast. The images were transformed into the HSV color space, and an existing mask was used to segment seeds depending on their black color range. Gaussian blur (Ï = 9) was applied for noise reduction, then Canny edge detection (50,100) was applied to obtain the contours that were cleaned up using morphological operations (erosion and dilation). The very first contour detected was utilized as a reference object to determine a pixel-to-cm ratio (0.3 cm) for accurate size measurement. The seed dimensions were calculated using Euclidean distance, and their average color was taken for classification. Seeds were labeled as "good" if they had dimensions more than 2.2 mm and "bad" otherwise. The results were finally visualized using bar charts and superimposed contours to evaluate quality.</p>

          <p>The prototype code utilizes OpenCV and other libraries to process seed images and extract relevant features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Ghimire et al., 2023</xref>):</p><p><p>Color Segmentation</p></p><p>The input image is first converted from the RGB color space to the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Jin et al. (2022)</xref> suggested that the HSV model is more intuitive for color segmentation as it separates chromatic content (hue) from intensity (value). Hue represents the color type, saturation indicates the vibrancy, and value reflects the brightness of the pixel. This conversion ensures that variations in lighting and intensity have minimal impact on the segmentation process.</p><p>Based on predefined thresholds for hue, saturation, and value, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Toda et al. (2020)</xref> presented a binary mask that is created to isolate the regions corresponding to the seeds. These thresholds are determined through an experimental process where the range of color values corresponding to the seeds is identified. For example, seeds that appear black or dark in color would have specific ranges of low saturation and brightness values. The mask filters out all other regions of the image, retaining only the areas matching the seed color characteristics.</p><ol start="2"><p>Morphological Analysis</p></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">MartÃ­n-GÃ³mez et al. (2024)</xref> studied Morphological operations performed on the segmented binary mask to enhance seed detection and extract key geometric features.</p><p>After applying the mask, contours are detected using image processing techniques such as the Canny edge detector or similar contour-finding algorithms. Contours are the boundaries that outline the detected seed regions. These boundaries are essential for identifying the seed shapes and locations in the image.</p><p>For each detected seed, the bounding box is computed, which is the smallest rectangle that encloses the contour. Using the bounding box, dimensions such as width, height, and aspect ratio are calculated.</p><p>Width is the horizontal size of the bounding box.</p><p>Height is the vertical size of the bounding box.</p><p>Aspect Ratio is the ratio of width to height, which helps characterize the shape of the seed.</p><ol start="3"><p>Color Feature Extraction</p></p><p>Color is a key feature for identifying seed quality, as healthy seeds often exhibit specific color characteristics.</p><p>For each segmented seed region, the average Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color intensities are computed. This involves summing the RGB values of all pixels within the seed region and dividing by the total number of pixels. The resulting values represent the overall color tone of the seed.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Haque &amp;amp; Haque (2018)</xref> computed RGB values are then mapped to the nearest named color using the Euclidean distance metric. The Euclidean distance is calculated between the RGB values of the seed and a set of predefined RGB values corresponding to standard colors. The named color with the smallest distance is assigned to the seed. This mapping allows for an intuitive interpretation of seed color, such as "black," "dark brown," or "gray."</p><p>In our image processing project, we focused on analyzing high-resolution images of onion seeds. We started by converting these images into the HSV color space, which allowed us to apply a specific color mask to isolate the seeds based on their black hues. To enhance the clarity of the images, we used a Gaussian blur with a standard deviation of 9, which helped reduce any unwanted noise.</p><p>Next, we employed Canny edge detection with threshold values set between 50 and 100 to carefully extract the contours of the seeds. To further refine these edges, we applied morphological operations like dilation and erosion, which helped to clean up the results.</p><p>After identifying the first contour, we used it as a reference object to create a pixel-to-centimeter ratio of 0.3 cm. This allowed us to measure each seed's width and height using Euclidean distance. We also analyzed the average color of each seed to classify them according to a predefined color set.</p><p>In our classification process, we labeled seeds as "good" if their dimensions were greater than 2.2 mm and "bad" if they fell short of that measurement. Finally, we visualized our findings with bar charts and overlaid contours to clearly showcase the results of our seed classification efforts. This approach helped us better understand the quality of the onion seeds we were analyzing.</p>

Even in the face of potential challenges like variations in lighting and slightly distorted original images, segmentation and measurement from the model provided are still robust.

This is especially important in applications such as agriculture or food quality control, where large amounts of seeds must often be analyzed.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">This process required precise measurements and evaluations to ascertain the suitability of the seeds for further agricultural use. The results indicated that the majority of the seeds met acceptable standards; however, a few deviated from the predefined criteria because some exhibited irregular attributes.

          <p>Among the nine seeds analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>), six were cla<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">ssified as Good Seeds, as they met the requisite dimensional thresholds and quality standards. These seeds displayed consistent geometrical properties, which indicate a notable uniformity and high quality. For instance, Seed 1 (3.0 mm Ã 2.3 mm), Seed 2 (2.6 mm Ã 2.9 mm), and Seed 3 (2.8 mm Ã 2.5 mm) all exhibited optimal sizes and were thus deemed good. Similarly, Seeds 4, 5, and 7 conformed to the established standards, further underscoring the reliability of the batch.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">However, three seeds were categorized as Bad Seeds due to their suboptimal dimensions, which likely suggest underdevelopment or deformities. For example, Seed 6 (2.2 mm Ã 1.8 mm) and Seed 8 (1.5 mm Ã 2.2 mm) had the smallest dimensions among the samples, falling considerably below the acceptable range. Seed 9 (2.1 mm Ã 2.0 mm) also slightly failed to meet the threshold, which resulted in its classification as a bad seed. These deviations highlight the necessity of rigorous quality control measures because only high-quality seeds should be selected for further use.</p>

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>One of the observations of interest is the accuracy of classification at 88.89%, which suggests that the model is fairly good at distinguishing between good-quality seeds and bad seeds. Nevertheless, note that there can be classification mistakes caused by similarity in visual features between borderline examples, like seeds with marginal variation in size or analogous color features that might lie near the established threshold values (e.g., â¤2.2 mm width and height). This restriction indicates the necessity of fine-tuning the decision boundaries or incorporating more features like texture, surface morphology, or 3D shape descriptors to enhance the robustness of the model.</p><p>The bar chart illustrating good and bad seeds shows the dataset to be moderately imbalanced. Most of the seeds plot just above or below the predetermined quality threshold, which can have the effect of introducing bias within classification because it is a hard cutoff. Use of a soft classification margin or probabilistic thresholding might make this less problematic in future development. The seed size distribution scatter plot further supports the existence of a cluster of seeds at the 2.2 mm cutoff, supporting the notion that misclassifications would likely result from slight dimensional differences. This plot can also be employed to determine if a more dynamic or data-based threshold would more effectively distinguish the classes.</p><p>Classification by color, also demonstrated by stacked bar charts (which aren't part of existing visualizations), also has its limitations. Because lighting and shadows can influence the appearance of colors, color averaging by itself can be insufficient as a quality measure. A more sophisticated color calibration method or machine learning model that learns the RGB histogram or the HSV color space may better increase classification accuracy. Additionally, the model has no adaptive processes to correct misclassifications. The integration of a feedback-driven learning mechanism or confusion matrix analysis would identify patterns where the model repeatedly goes wrong and help drive retraining processes.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This research introduces a vision-based classifier method for estimating onion seed quality using image processing methods based on dimensional and color characteristics. In the experimental work, it was shown that the model registered a classification rate of 88.89% and thus proposed a promising base for low-cost, non-destructive seed quality estimation.</p><p>The results validate that seed sizeâi.e., width and height thresholdsâcan be an effective measure for distinguishing between good and bad seeds. Nevertheless, seeds near the decision boundary presented difficulties in correct classification, indicating the requirement of more advanced feature extraction and adaptive thresholding in subsequent work. Furthermore, although color-based features offer complementary information, their sensitivity to variations in lighting conditions could restrict reliability unless sophisticated preprocessing or calibration methods are employed.</p><p>This method provides potential value to agricultural professionals and seed processing industries for automated, scalable, and cost-effective seed quality screening platforms. However, potential future enhancement involves incorporating machine learning algorithms, increasing the dataset, and integrating comparative benchmarking with state-of-the-art techniques to improve model generalizability and performance.</p><p>In short, the method presented here establishes a solid foundation for automated seed classification but also highlights the need for ongoing improvement, particularly in error analysis, adaptive classification methods, and verification against current literature and commercial systems.</p>
