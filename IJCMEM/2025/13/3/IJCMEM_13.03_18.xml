      <abstract><p>This research numerically investigates entropy generation in a laminar forced convective flow of Al$_2$O$_3$-water nanofluid within a 2D axisymmetric pipe under uniform heat flux. The study employed aluminum oxide nanoparticles with a consistent diameter of 30nm, dispersed in water at volumetric concentrations of 1% to 4%. For Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 200 to 900, the analysis focused on the interplay between the Nusselt number, thermal-hydraulic performance, and entropy generation as functions of both flow velocity and nanoparticle concentration. Results show that elevating the Re and volume fraction not only increases the Nusselt number but also reduces the total entropy generation by 22.25%. A corresponding rise in pressure drop was also observed with these increases. Consequently, the application of Al$_2$O$_3$-water nanofluid proves to be thermodynamically advantageous, enhancing heat transfer characteristics while simultaneously suppressing entropy generation.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Internal duct flow, defined as the movement of a fluid within enclosed conduits like pipes, is a fundamental and widely researched area in fluid dynamics. The defining characteristic of such flow is the presence of solid boundaries, which profoundly influences the behavior and properties of the working fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Understanding these properties and the fluid's response to confinement is crucial, given its prevalence in engineering systems including power plants, air conditioning units, and heat exchangers. Consequently, a primary focus for researchers has been the accurate prediction of fluid velocity and heat transfer characteristics within these ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>The choice of working fluid is a critical factor, as it directly dictates the flow characteristics in any physical or computational model. Thermophysical properties—such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity—exert a significant influence on flow behavior. For example, a fluid with high viscosity resists motion, leading to slower flow rates, whereas a low-viscosity fluid flows more readily. Similarly, denser fluids generally result in higher pressure drops and slower flows, while less dense fluids facilitate lower pressure and faster velocities. To improve system performance, significant research efforts have been dedicated to developing novel working fluids with superior thermal properties compared to conventional options, as enhancing these properties directly impacts the hydrodynamic and thermal performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. This pursuit led to the innovation of engineered fluids containing nanoscale particles.</p><p>These synthetic nanoparticles can be produced from various natural elements like Copper, Gold, Aluminum, and Zinc. Specifically, a nanofluid is a base fluid infused with suspended particles typically smaller than 100 nanometers. The dispersion of these particles can markedly improve the fluid's thermal conductivity, positioning nanofluids as a highly promising medium for advanced heat transfer applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>The experimental investigations remain crucial for advancing nanofluid technology, as they provide the essential data on thermophysical properties needed for practical system design. The work of Vajjha and Das [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], for instance, underscores this approach by deriving empirical correlations directly from laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity. These experimental findings are fundamentally interpreted and contextualized within the established principles of heat transfer, which are comprehensively detailed in foundational texts such as Incropera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>This potential for efficiency gains has attracted considerable scientific interest. A nanofluid is essentially a two-component mixture comprising a base fluid (e.g., water or oil) and nanoparticles. Studies have confirmed that the inclusion of nanoparticles enhances the thermophysical properties of the base fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>An experimental investigation by Hozien et al.

Using nanoparticle diameters of 40 nm and volume fractions of 0.1% to 2%, they found that the heat transfer coefficient increased with both volume fraction and Reynolds number, though this was accompanied by a higher-pressure drop. Notably, the heat transfer performance with a 2% volume concentration was augmented by 32% compared to pure water. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] computationally investigated conjugate heat transfer in microtubes, finding that axial wall heat conduction promoted a uniform heat flux at the inner wall surface. Fard et al.

Bejan introduced a paradigm shift in thermal system optimization methodology through the concept of Entropy Generation Minimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]; however, this theoretical framework was not applied to nanofluids, which require a precise balance between heat transfer enhancement and hydraulic effects. On the experimental front, the study by Wen and Ding provided compelling evidence for enhanced heat transfer in nanofluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p><p>The 1998 experimental work by Pak and Cho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] represents a foundational investigation into nanofluid convection, critically documenting both the attendant thermal enhancement and the consequential rise in viscous dissipation. This study established the enduring paradigm of the thermal-hydraulic trade-off intrinsic to nanofluid systems. The fundamental mechanisms underlying this balance are rooted in classical heat transfer and fluid dynamics principles, as methodically expounded in authoritative references like Nellis and Klein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], thereby furnishing the theoretical framework requisite for analysing such empirical data.</p><p>Based on the comprehensive literature review, a research gap is identified: no prior study has comprehensively considered laminar nanofluid flow with entropy generation in a pipe subjected to a constant heat flux boundary condition, specifically examining how entropy generation influences the combined thermal and hydraulic performance during the flow and heat transfer process.

By adopting this entropy-focused methodology, the work provides a fresh thermodynamic viewpoint for evaluating the efficiency of nanofluid-based thermal systems.

</inline-formula>-water nanofluid at modest concentrations (1-2%) in conjunction with elevated flow regimes (Re $&gt;$ 500) offers considerable advantages. This strategy promotes superior thermal performance by enabling greater heat removal capacity within a fixed volume, thereby allowing for a reduction in the physical size of the system. Concurrently, it elevates thermodynamic efficiency; the observed decrease in total entropy generation indicates a reduction in the destruction of available energy, which can translate into lower operational expenditures over time. The Performance Evaluation Criterion (PEC) and Bejan number further serve as definitive benchmarks for navigating design compromises. A designer might, for example, choose a nanofluid with a high particle concentration to prioritize heat transfer in a severely space-limited setting, accepting the consequent increase in pumping power. Alternatively, a lower concentration could be selected to achieve a more favorable equilibrium between thermal performance and pumping energy consumption.</p>

            <title>2.2. Models of nanofluid properties</title>
          
          <p>A variety of numerical approaches are available for modeling and calculating nanofluid properties. Among these, the single-phase method operates on the fundamental assumption that the nanoparticles and the base fluid are in thermal and dynamic equilibrium, meaning they share identical velocity and temperature fields. This allows the mixture to be treated as a single, homogeneous fluid. Consequently, the standard set of governing equations can be directly applied to this homogeneous medium, requiring only the calculation of its effective thermophysical properties.</p><p>• Density</p><p>Mixing rule for solid-liquid mixtures were used to find the effective density given as below:</p>

            <title>2.4. Numerical simulation</title>
          
          <p>The process of numerical modeling encompasses several sequential steps. It begins with the creation of the geometric model, followed by mesh generation. A critical step involves conducting a mesh independence study to ensure the solution is not affected by the grid resolution. Subsequently, the appropriate boundary conditions are defined, and a solution algorithm is selected to guarantee both numerical stability and accelerated convergence. The model's accuracy is then verified, culminating in the post-processing phase where results are extracted, analyzed, and discussed.</p><p>• Geometry and boundary conditions</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the tube dimensions and boundary conditions used in the numerical analysis. The numerical analysis includes constant values, such as the inlet temperature and heat flux, while the inlet velocity varies in proportion to the Reynolds number and nanoparticle concentration.</p>

          <p>• Mesh independent study</p><p>The selection and configuration of the computational mesh are critical to the accuracy of the numerical solution. In this work, a uniformly distributed mesh is applied along the pipe's length, with a refined concentration of elements near the wall. This strategic refinement, achieved through an inflation layer as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, is essential for minimizing numerical error and for accurately resolving the steep gradients present within the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layers.</p>

          <p>A structured mesh consisting of quadrilateral cells was implemented to discretize the computational domain. To resolve the pronounced velocity and temperature gradients in the near-wall region, fifteen inflation layers were applied at the boundary. The thickness of the first layer was specifically calibrated to achieve a y+ value below 1.0, ensuring compatibility with the enhanced wall treatment required for the laminar flow model.</p><p>A systematic grid refinement process was conducted until the calculated values for the Nusselt number and wall shear stress showed negligible variation.

This test was performed for pure water at a Reynolds number of 800 across a range of grid densities.

The contour plot reveals that the highest axial velocity occurs at the maximum volume concentration of 4%. This phenomenon is attributed to the increase in both viscosity and density that accompanies a higher nanoparticle load. Since the Reynolds number is held constant, the ratio of these properties adjusts, leading to an elevated centerline velocity with increasing concentration (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mu4pgx7r75">
    <mml:mi>φ</mml:mi>

This pattern is accentuated by the favorable mixing between fluid layers and solid nanoparticles, which enhances the inertial forces within the flow.</p>

The HTC demonstrates a clear enhancement with rising nanofluid volume concentration. This improvement is driven by a reduction in the temperature difference between the pipe wall and the fluid's mean temperature, as visually confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>. Consequently, the incorporation of nanoparticles directly augments the convective heat transfer performance. A corresponding increase in the Nusselt number with higher concentrations is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. This trend is expected, as a greater volume fraction of nanoparticles elevates the effective thermal conductivity of the fluid, thereby promoting more efficient heat transfer.</p>

This enhancement stems from improved mixing within the fluid layers, favorable inertial forces, and the fundamental improvement in the nanofluid's thermal conductivity coupled with its reduced specific heat capacity, which lowers its energy storage potential. The results confirm that the average Nusselt number rises with both increasing volume fraction and Reynolds number. A maximum augmentation of 27.07% in the average Nusselt number was achieved under the conditions of a 30 nm particle diameter, a Reynolds number of 900, and a volume concentration (<inline-formula>

A PEC value exceeding unity indicates a beneficial use of nanofluid, as the relative enhancement in heat transfer outweighs the relative increase in pumping power due to pressure drop. Conversely, a value below one suggests that the penalty of increased pumping power surpasses the thermal benefit. For the specific nanofluid analyzed in this research, elevating the nanoparticle concentration demonstrated a negative effect on the PEC.

      <p>From a physical standpoint, the pressure drop along the pipe axis results from the combined mechanisms of viscous dissipation and momentum diffusion. Elevated nanoparticle concentrations exacerbate this pressure loss due to the accompanying rise in the nanofluid's density and viscosity, which collectively amplify the resistance to flow. This behavior underscores a critical design trade-off: the thermal performance gains achieved through nanoparticles are accompanied by a non-negligible hydraulic penalty that must be considered in practical system design.</p><p>The findings reveal a pronounced sensitivity of the system's performance to variations in both the Reynolds number and nanoparticle concentration. A strong, positive correlation is observed between the average Nusselt number and increases in either parameter. Of particular significance is the high sensitivity of total entropy generation to the Reynolds number, which exhibits a substantial decline as Re increases.

</inline-formula> = 2%. This non-linearity suggests that operating with volume concentrations below 2% can provide the desired heat transfer enhancement while avoiding excessive penalties in pumping power and frictional irreversibility.</p>

</inline-formula>-water nanofluid in laminar pipe flow under a constant heat flux boundary condition offers a dual advantage: simultaneous enhancement of heat transfer rates and a reduction in thermodynamic irreversibility. A primary practical finding is that system efficiency is optimized at higher Reynolds numbers coupled with lower nanoparticle concentrations, specifically within the 1-2% range. This operational regime achieves a significant thermal performance improvement of up to 27% alongside a substantial 22% reduction in total entropy generation, indicating a more efficient system with lower energy waste. For design scenarios where pumping power is a major constraint, the Performance Evaluation Criterion (PEC) serves as the essential design metric. Conversely, in applications demanding maximum heat dissipation, higher nanoparticle concentrations may be justified, provided the associated increase in frictional entropy is acknowledged.</p><p>This investigation numerically analyzes entropy generation for Al<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>-water nanofluid flow in a two-dimensional axisymmetric pipe, with viscous dissipation incorporated into the model. A single-phase approach is employed to simulate the nanofluid's flow and convective heat transfer characteristics. The research systematically examines the influence of key governing parameters: nanoparticle volume concentration, Reynolds number, and nanoparticle size. The findings derived from the analysis lead to the following conclusions:</p><p>• Elevating the nanoparticle concentration leads to an increase in the flow's maximum velocity, overall pressure drop, and wall shear stress.</p><p>• A higher nanoparticle concentration reduces the temperature difference between the pipe wall and the bulk fluid, resulting in a concomitant rise in both the heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number. The peak enhancement of 27.07% in the average Nusselt number was observed at Re = 900, <inline-formula>

    <mml:mi>φ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> = 0.04, and with a particle diameter (<italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic>) of 30 nm.</p><p>• Increasing the nanoparticle concentration reduces the thermal component of entropy generation but augments the frictional component. The net effect is a decrease in both the total entropy generation and the Bejan number. The maximum recorded reduction in total entropy generation was 22.25% for the conditions of Re = 900, <inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> = 0.04, and <italic>d<sub>p</sub></italic> = 30 nm.</p><p>This study is limited by the use of a single-phase numerical approach, which assumes uniform thermal equilibrium between the base fluid and nanoparticles. Future investigations should implement two-phase or Eulerian–Lagrangian models to capture slip velocity and particle migration effects. Additionally, experimental validation is recommended to confirm numerical predictions and extend the analysis to turbulent regimes and other nanoparticle types.</p>
