      <abstract><p>A bibliometric analysis of research on electronic banking (EB) services and customer satisfaction has been conducted using 124 publications indexed in the Scopus database from 1999 to 2024. The study employs VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel to identify key trends, scholarly contributions, and thematic clusters within the literature. Findings indicate a significant surge in research output since 2019, with India emerging as the most prolific contributing country. The International Journal of Bank Marketing is identified as the leading publication venue, while Kumar, P. is recognized as the most frequently published author. Institutional contributions are led by the University of Delhi. Co-occurrence and bibliographic coupling analyses reveal five dominant research clusters: customer satisfaction, EB, electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM), customer loyalty, and sales. Furthermore, critical research linkages and evolving thematic patterns are highlighted, underscoring the dynamic nature of this research field. Several research gaps are identified, particularly regarding the integration of emerging financial technologies, regulatory impacts, and cross-cultural variations in EB adoption. The study offers theoretical and practical implications for scholars, financial institutions, and policymakers. Limitations, including database constraints and methodology scope, are acknowledged, providing a foundation for future investigations. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolving interplay between EB services and customer satisfaction, paving the way for further empirical and conceptual advancements.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The development of EB, defined as the delivery of banking services via electronic channels, enables customers to engage in online banking, use ATMs, and access services via mobile devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Dangaiso et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Basu et al., 2024</xref>). Rapid technological advances and the Internet revolution have impacted banking operations, service delivery, and customer relationships and allowed a significant transition from physical transactions to digital solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Chauhan et al., 2022a</xref>). The emergence of EB at the beginning of the 20th century followed the introduction of ATMs, which allowed banks to facilitate fundamental cash transactions outside traditional branch hours. In addition, the emergence of Internet and mobile banking in 2000 was a significant advancement since it included real-time transactions and customer support in banking apps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Singh &amp;amp; Srivastava, 2020</xref>). This advancement has introduced various banking channels, including phone banking, SMS notifications, and digital applications, that cater to the increasing population of technologically adept customers. This digital transformation has diminished operational costs and enabled banks to enhance efficiency, volume, and service accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Jebarajakirthy &amp;amp; Shankar, 2021</xref>). EB has emerged as the primary approach, with numerous customers using daily financial services. The selection of banking services via Internet and mobile platforms for transactions, including bill payment, money transfer, and account inquiries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Chauhan et al., 2022b</xref>), is mainly pushed by convenience, speed, and the capacity to access services from any location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ananda et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, this acceptance presents obstacles, particularly in monitoring customer satisfaction and securing customer loyalty, as competition within the banking industry intensifies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Chaimaa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Lin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Customer satisfaction has been a primary emphasis in EB because of its direct relationship with customer loyalty, retention, and public interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Ayinaddis et al. (2023)</xref> argue that customer satisfaction is significantly affected by the usability, dependability, and security of EB systems in the digital world. In contrast to conventional banking, where a personal touch can reduce customer complaints, EB focuses only on the functioning and design of digital systems. Technical failures, extended processing delays, or recognized weaknesses may swiftly dissatisfy customers and force potential customers to engage with banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Arif et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Rahi et al., 2020</xref>). Customer satisfaction with EB is closely linked to the quality of e-services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Raza et al. (2020)</xref> argue that service quality is essential for customer satisfaction in digital banking, with dependability, responsiveness, and assurance being important factors. Digital banking systems must ensure quick and accurate transactions while offering rapid customer service to address difficulties efficiently. This is particularly significant since EB customers anticipate rapid access and faster resolutions compared to conventional banking.</p><p>In recent years, extensive empirical research has been done regarding EB services and customer satisfaction, including elements such as EB service quality, determinants of satisfaction and loyalty, and EB practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Gautam &amp;amp; Sah, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hammoud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Indrasari et al., 2022</xref>). This has led to a significant body of literature on EB. Through an extensive literature analysis, researchers can thoroughly understand EB services and the customer satisfaction sector.</p><p>Previous bibliometric studies of EB, such as the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Mintah et al. (2024)</xref>, analyzed academic publications on EB over three decades. This study evaluates the conceptual framework and trends while highlighting the new potential in EB research. A bibliometric analysis was performed on 2,391 research publications in the EB field using data from the Scopus database. The publications received examination and integration through volume analysis, citation analysis, authorship analysis, collaboration assessment, co-citation analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Bonang et al. (2024)</xref> provide a bibliometric analysis of service quality and customer satisfaction in Islamic banking as the basis for further research. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research concerning service quality and customer satisfaction in Islamic banking, classifying the data into three main fields: productivity, citation trends, and network analysis.</p><p>The current study could not find a bibliometric analysis of EB services and customer satisfaction, nor did it take on a complete bibliometric examination of EB services and customer satisfaction studies. To fill this gap, this bibliometric approach is essential for providing an advanced perspective, understanding the progression of literature from conceptual confusion to theoretical investigation, and defining the primary constructs and relationships between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Zainuldin &amp;amp; Lui, 2022</xref>). Moreover, the progression of literature involves the cooperation among researchers that forms the research community for creating and distributing knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Biancone et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, it is essential to understand the evolution of collaboration among scholars, institutions, and countries from varied backgrounds. The application is very beneficial to researchers and theorists in the scientific field.</p><p>Furthermore, from a theoretical perspective, the study is grounded in technology adoption models, service quality frameworks, and customer satisfaction theories that help explain the dynamics of EB services and customer experiences. Understanding the evolution of these themes through bibliometric analysis allows for identifying key contributors, leading institutions, and dominant research trends. Practically, the study addresses the growing reliance on digital banking and the necessity for financial institutions to enhance service quality, security, and customer trust. Exploring the main themes within the conceptual framework helps identify critical determinants of customer satisfaction and areas for future development. This study provides valuable insights into potential advancements in EB services and customer engagement strategies by mapping existing research and highlighting gaps.</p><p>Q1. What is the domain of EB and customer satisfaction research?</p><p>Q2. Who are the leading contributors, authors, affiliations, journals, and countries in EB services and customer satisfaction?</p><p>Q3. What are the main themes and topics within the conceptual framework of EB services and customer satisfaction?</p><p>Q4. Where else can future research contribute to EB service and customer satisfaction?</p><p>The primary objective of this research is to delineate the intellectual progression and knowledge framework based on publication trends while examining the research patterns of sources, documents, authors, institutions, and countries. Additionally, it aims to identify the major topics within the intellectual structure of EB and customer satisfaction, contributing to future research in this field.</p><p>This study will significantly improve conformity with the expected results of a bibliometric analysis. This study makes a theoretical contribution by using bibliometric analysis to uncover the intellectual structure of EB services and customer satisfaction research. Identifying key authors, influential studies, and thematic clusters provides a comprehensive view of how this field has evolved. The bibliometric results offer deeper insights into the theoretical underpinnings of customer satisfaction in digital banking by mapping the dominant frameworks, such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), SERVQUAL, and Trust-Based Theories. Understanding the citation patterns and co-authorship networks helps reveal how different perspectives on service quality, usability, security, and customer loyalty have been developed and interconnected over time. This approach consolidates existing knowledge and highlights gaps where future theoretical advancements can refine models related to digital banking experiences and consumer behaviour. This research will address insights from the performance (including publication trends, leading institutions, authors, articles, countries, and highly cited articles) and intellectual structure (including key concepts and topics) related to EB and customer satisfaction. This study will enhance future research by allowing for more efficient identification and integration of new contributions with existing ones. Future research may identify the specific field of EB service quality and its correlation with customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as the primary focus of their study and its contribution to enhancing the current understanding within this field. This study will encourage future research by using the insights obtained from the present review to its recommended agenda. This study will highlight critical gaps in existing research that future investigations may address to ensure the importance and relevance of EB and customer satisfaction.</p>

      <title>2. Research methodology</title>
      <p>The researchers used bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer software to attain the research objectives. Bibliometric methods evaluate and define researchers' publications based on citation frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Donthu et al., 2021</xref>), using each article as the central unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Lancho-Barrantes &amp;amp; CantÃº-Ortiz, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis enables the investigation of research trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Tandon et al., 2021</xref>), potential research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Arshad Khan &amp;amp; Alhumoudi, 2022</xref>), and critical components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) within the literature. Moreover, the bibliometric study could identify research gaps and guide future studies on the growing topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Patel &amp;amp; Siddiqui, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, compared to the traditional structured approach, the bibliometric technique can handle extensive articles to establish a scientific framework for research issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">Tuli, 2024</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.1. Data collection and screening procedure</title>
          
          <p>Step 1. Three hundred thirty articles were identified in the Scopus database in November 2024, using all relevant keywords such as EB Services, EB Services, and Customer Satisfaction.</p><p>Step 2. In the second phase, we limited the subject area to business management and economics, obtaining 181 articles. Subsequently, we restricted the selection to English-language publications, resulting in 124 articles.</p><p>Step 3. In the third phase, these articles were extracted from Scopus and added to a CSV file.</p><p>Step 4. The data were organized, displayed, developed, and evaluated using the VOSviewer program in the fourth phase. This program was used to develop quantitative and qualitative measures that would facilitate our understanding of the productivity and impact of the scientific literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Shah et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

            <title>3.1. Descriptive analysis</title>
          
          <p>This section investigates the descriptive analysis of components such as the 25-year publication timeline, leading journals, authors, research institutions, papers, and countries. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the volume of publications from 1999 to 2024, with the first article published in 1999 indicating the initial entry into this field of study. Research on EB and customer satisfaction has steadily risen since 2019, with a significant increase starting in 2022. In recent years, there has been an important rise in the literature about EB and customer satisfaction, attracting considerable corporate and academic attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Tahtamouni, 2023</xref>). The increase in publications may be related to the quick growth of digital financial services and fintech, requiring traditional banks to provide EB services, leading to an enhanced understanding of customer satisfaction in the age of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ananda et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

          <p>Digitally, customers want rapid, safe, and tailored experiences from banks; this expectation requires a study to determine the factors influencing satisfaction and loyalty, including ease of use, safety, accessibility, and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Ighomereho et al., 2023</xref>). Consequences of COVID-19 The epidemic has caused many individuals to give up face-to-face banking for the convenience of EB, necessitating enhancements in the online banking experience, addressing customer concerns, and successfully fulfilling user requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alarifi &amp;amp; Husain, 2023</xref>). The accessibility of information about customers via digital channels enables researchers to monitor customer behaviour and preferences, while advanced analytics, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, enhance comprehensive studies on EB satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Arshad Khan &amp;amp; Alhumoudi, 2022</xref>). Competition in digital banking has driven banks to enhance their understanding of customer satisfaction. Investigations in this domain enable banks to distinguish themselves from competitors and enhance service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Kashyap et al., 2024</xref>), with regulatory emphasis on customer experience. As digital banking expands, authorities focus on protecting customers' rights and ensuring satisfaction. Research in this domain assists banks in complying with rules while improving service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> presents the ten leading journals with the highest volume of published articles about EB and customer satisfaction in the banking sector over 25 years.

It illustrates the intensity of the interaction between organizations and the degree of their interconnection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Zainuldin &amp;amp; Lui, 2022</xref>). <italic>Customer satisfaction</italic> has a significant connection with complete strength since it is crucial for banks to maintain customer contentment and fulfilment. Content customers show loyalty and share positive information about goods and services, thus enhancing the company's performance and connections with other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The second keyword, <italic>Electronic Commerce</italic>, relates to customer satisfaction. In EB, customer satisfaction and e-commerce are linked because an enhanced e-commerce experience encourages customer convenience and time efficiency. If EB is quick, dependable, and user-friendly, it improves customer satisfaction, leading to repeated service use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Mansour et al., 2022</xref>). The third key term is <italic>Sales</italic>; in EB, the correlation between sales and customer satisfaction is that enhanced customer satisfaction contributes to increased sales. Customers content with EB obtains more services and products, resulting in a higher sales rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Nazaritehrani &amp;amp; Mashali, 2020</xref>). The fourth term is<italic> EB</italic>, with studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Raza et al.

              <p>Numerous research studies indicate that customer satisfaction in EB is essential for securing long-term profitability and sustainability for financial institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Ayinaddis et al. (2023)</xref> argue that if a bank's e-services are efficient, rapid, and dependable, clients will persist in using such services and will be preferred over rival banks. Moreover, maintaining a high customer satisfaction rate in digital banking is crucial for consistently attracting new clients and retaining existing ones, allowing banks to maintain an advantage in the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Son et al., 2020</xref>). Rising customer satisfaction enhances the bank's reputation and market recognition, which is vital for long-term revenue and economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Supriyanto et al., 2021</xref>). Other common topics are Internet banking, customer loyalty, and service quality; both EB and service quality are essential since they significantly contribute to the success of EB and customer satisfaction. Online banking enables banks to provide customers with a convenient and rapid service experience, enhancing customer loyalty and establishing a long-term connection with the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Baabdullah et al., 2019</xref>). The quality of the bank's service is crucial since customers want trust and a positive experience; superior service may encourage customer loyalty. Likewise, excellent service quality enhances the bank's reputation and competitiveness, which are crucial for customer retention and overall success.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the network visualization of prevalent keywords obtained from co-word analysis. Consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>, the customer satisfaction theme includes a significant cluster demonstrating a considerable correlation with the EB sector. Additionally, five notable clusters show significant relationships among different word combinations. The customer satisfaction cluster is integrated with the electronic commerce, online banking, internet, finance, and information technology clusters. Consequently, these elements collaborate to enhance customer experience and convenience; the emergence of digital banking and Internet technology has significantly expedited online banking and financial transactions, leading to increased customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Raza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Sharma &amp;amp; Sharma, 2019</xref>). Moreover, information technology significantly contributes to the efficiency of information security and services in EB, enhancing customer satisfaction by providing convenient and dependable financial services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Ahmed et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, these components collaborate to guarantee that customers experience modern and accelerated services, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.</p><p>The EB cluster includes trust, satisfaction, loyalty, online banking, and e-service quality; consequently, customers' trust and loyalty in online banking are enhanced when they receive reliable and high-quality services that effectively address their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Alhanatleh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Mulia et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the quality of e-services is crucial in enhancing customer satisfaction and delivering rapid and efficient services to enhance customer retention and encourage repeated use of EB services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Kashyap et al., 2024</xref>). Consequently, trust, loyalty, and service quality all contribute significantly to the success of EB and customer satisfaction</p><p>The e-CRM cluster is linked to customer satisfaction, banks, the banking sector, and customer experience. Consequently, this integrated method enables banks to enhance relationship management and sustain lasting relationships. E-CRM enhances the understanding of consumer needs and delivers customized offerings, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Kumar et al., 2022a</xref>). Furthermore, in the banking sector, e-CRM prioritizes enhancing the customer experience since these technologies provide superior management of customer relationships and speed responses to inquiries, providing long-term advantages for banks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Mokha &amp;amp; Kumar, 2021</xref>). A significant correlation exists between e-CRM and customer satisfaction and experience, which enhances the banks' value.</p>

              <p>The customer loyalty cluster is integrated with banking and online banking services. These three components create strong relationships with customers and loyalty. Online banking offers ease to customers regarding time and delays, significantly enhancing their trust and loyalty, as people want to stay loyal to a bank that effectively addresses their demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Gautam &amp;amp; Sah, 2023</xref>). Consequently, banks develop customer loyalty via online banking and maintain a leading position in the competitive market.</p><p>The sales cluster is linked to financial services and the quality of service. Consequently, banks maintain excellent service quality and effectively address consumer needs, resulting in increased revenues due to enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Supriyanto et al., 2021</xref>). Superior services incentivize customer utilization.

              <p>Bibliographic coupling occurs when two articles have the same reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Hassan et al., 2023</xref>). The purpose of evaluating bibliographic coupling is to identify current studies within a topic, offering a dynamic approach to analyze the conceptual framework of the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Mintah et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref> presents the ten most cited articles identified using bibliographic coupling analysis, ranked by total citations. These ten studies indicated that several publications used them as references for research on EB and customer satisfaction within the banking sector. The study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Suh &amp;amp; Han (2002)</xref> has an outstanding citation index and may provide a novel pathway for investigating characteristics that enhance customer acceptance of Internet banking. A comprehensive analysis of 845 cases conducted via a web survey on user behaviour towards Internet banks reveals that trust significantly influences the acceptability of Internet banking, as shown by statistical analyses using structural equation modelling. Additionally, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">CasalÃ³ et al. (2008)</xref> suggests alternative ways for investigation; an interesting area for further study would involve analyzing the influence of innovative internet access methods (e.g., mobile phones) on customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth in the context of interactions between individuals and banks through these emerging technologies. The findings derived from the validation of measurement scales include in-conflict hypotheses via structural modelling. This research revealed that satisfaction with previous experiences on the bank's website positively impacted customer retention and favourable word-of-mouth. Moreover, website usability was recognized as positively influencing customer satisfaction, and, as expected, loyalty was significantly correlated with favourable word-of-mouth.</p><p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Nasri &amp;amp; Charfeddine (2012)</xref> provides a novel direction for future research by comparing users across different age demographics. This Research empirically examines the determinants affecting the adoption of EB among Tunisian banking customers. This research uses the technological acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as its core frameworks. The results urge bank managers to develop strategies that enhance the use of Internet banking. Financial institutions must enhance security and privacy measures to protect customers' personal and financial data, enhancing user trust. The government needs to support the banking sector by adopting clear and strict rules, therefore enhancing customer confidence in Internet banking, enhancing Internet infrastructure, and encouraging online banking services. The research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Karjaluoto et al. (2019)</xref> developed and assessed a series of hypotheses on the antecedents of perceived value in the use of MFSA; it also examined the effect of such use on the development of customers' comprehensive relationships with banks. The study's assumptions were assessed using two samples (N = 992; N = 524), including diverse types of MFSA end-users in Finland, a significant country in digital banking. The results corroborated all predictions and demonstrated that self-awareness and product innovation are the primary determinants of perceived MFSA value. The findings demonstrate that the perceived value of MFSAs significantly enhances customers' overall pleasure and loyalty to their bank.</p>

      <title>4. Practical implication</title>
      <p>For banks, adopting technological measures such as biometric authentication, AI-driven fraud detection, and blockchain technology can significantly enhance the security of EB. Implementing real-time transaction monitoring and automated anomaly detection can prevent cyber threats and fraudulent activities. Banks should also invest in advanced encryption protocols and regularly update cybersecurity infrastructure to protect customer data and financial transactions. For customers, increasing awareness and education on secure online banking practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and recognizing phishing attempts, can enhance security. Financial institutions should provide user-friendly security features, such as biometric logins and encrypted communication channels, to build customer trust and satisfaction. For governments, enacting specific regulations that mandate compliance with international cybersecurity standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPRâRegulation (EU) 2016/679) and the International Organization for Standardization, International Electro-Technical Commission (ISO)/IEC 27001, can enhance the operability of EB services. Governments should enforce strict data protection laws, require banks to conduct regular security audits, and establish legal frameworks to address digital fraud and cybercrime. Case studies of countries with robust digital banking policies, such as Singapore and Sweden, can provide empirical insights into effective regulatory practices.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The body of literature about EB and customer satisfaction within the banking sector has increased significantly during 1999 and 2024, publishing over 330 articles across several publications. Three hundred thirty articles were sourced from Scopus and then narrowed to 124 for bibliometric analysis. The main objective of this research was to analyze the intellectual evolution and knowledge structure in EB and customer satisfaction by evaluating the growth in publication quantity, identifying research trends across sources, documents, authors, affiliations, and countries, and exploring significant topics within this intellectual field. In addition, it provides substantial insights and recommendations to guide future research in EB and customer satisfaction. This study was motivated by the acknowledgment that although significant empirical research on EB services and customer satisfaction exists, to our knowledge, bibliometric analytical review papers on EB services have yet to be published. This study's results indicate that customer satisfaction, electronic commerce, sales, internet banking, banking, customer loyalty, service quality, EB, and service quality are common topics in current literature.</p><p>Furthermore, some prospective study directions (i.e., research exploring these aspects) might improve the comprehension of the customer's acceptance of Internet banking. Studies must examine various EB systems, such as Internet banking, mobile banking, or card technology, along with the different aspects relevant to each service, etc. Furthermore, the contribution structures within the research domain indicate that the literature mainly centres on developed and developing markets, specifically India, Iran, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The leading affiliated institution is the University of Delhi, the most active author is P. Kumar, and the leading journal is the International Journal of Bank Marketing. This study provides some practical implications for banks, governments, and customers. </p>

      <title>6. Limitations and future research directions</title>
      <p>This study presents several limitations that may impact the generalizability of its findings. </p><p>1-Scopus Database Limitation: We recognize that relying solely on Scopus may exclude relevant studies from other databases, such as Web of Science and Google Scholar. This selection, while ensuring high-quality peer-reviewed sources, may introduce selection bias. Future research should incorporate multiple databases to provide a more comprehensive perspective on EB services and customer satisfaction. </p><p>2- Exclusion of Non-English Publications: We acknowledge that limiting the study to English-language articles may overlook valuable research from non-English-speaking regions. Future studies should include multilingual sources to capture a more diverse global understanding of EB services and customer satisfaction. </p><p>3- Limited Scope of Source Types: The exclusion of books, book chapters, and review papers may have restricted the depth of our findings. Future studies should consider a broader range of academic and institutional sources to gain deeper insights into EB services and customer satisfaction.</p>
