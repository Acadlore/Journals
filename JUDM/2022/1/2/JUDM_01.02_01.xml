      <abstract><p>With the fall of the Communist Regimen in the Western Balkans Region, governance politics regarding urban and spatial planning processes led to significant changes in several territorial aspects. In this regard, several scientific studies and researches have put forward significant regional differences in urban development between cities of the Balkans that have followed very similar trajectories after the collapse of the “communist empire,” considering their willingness and desire to meet European standards - Tirana, Podgorica, Sarajevo are just some examples. Between the several disparities, these territories represent compared to Central and North European regions, massive and uncontrolled urban growth has been verified – catalyzed by liberal governance politics and private companies, without planning experts, and jeopardizing the need to include public participation in the development processes. This situation has led to significant uncontrolled planning and, consequently, to several negative social-economic impacts driven by it. For this reason, the development of a detailed review study considering spatial planning perspectives in the Western Balkans Region is seen as pivotal to understanding the existing planning disparities that affect the sustainable development of this area. Through an exploratory methodology – using both case study approach methods and territorial impact assessment (TIA) - it will be possible to understand how these events occurred and evolved, enabling the development of specific tools and approaches which might help to minimize the cumulative impacts of these processes. Therefore, the outcomes will define guidelines regarding urban planning processes for the main actors responsible for developing new governance measures toward achieving European standards.</p></abstract>

New massacre on both sides has started a major armed conflict in the SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbian paramilitaries led by Arkan captured Bijeljina on April 1, an important traffic junction in the northeastern SR of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and killed more civilians. On April 4, president of Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina, Alija Izetbegovic declared general mobilization. The Bosnian Serbs, supported by the Serbian government and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), mobilized their forces inside Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure ethnic Serb territory, then war soon spread across the country, accompanied by ethnic cleansing. The conflict was initially between the Yugoslav Army units in Bosnia which later transformed into the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) on the one side, and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) which was largely composed of Bosniaks, and the Croat forces in the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) on the other side.

          <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Belgrade is the capital of the Republic of Serbia (RS). It is located in Southeast European at the confluence of the Sava and Danube Rivers. Furthermore, it stands on the edge of the plain Pannonica with the Balkan Peninsula with a surface covering 3222.68 km<sup>2</sup> - representing 7.4% of Serbian territory.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The city has an important geostrategic position, once it is located at the convergence of three relevant travel routes among Europe and Balkans: (1) East-West route along the Valley of the river Danube; (2) Westward route along the Valley of the Sava River towards Trieste and the North of Italy; (3) Southeast route along the valleys of the rivers Morava and Vardar to the Aegean Sea. In fact, Belgrade has often been a border town between East and West - known as "Balkans Gates" or "Middle Europe Doors".</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Additionally, Belgrade's population is equivalent to a quarter of the RS population. Mainly due to migration from Serbia's rural areas due to the industrialization period – post-second world war. Belgrade's population is estimated at 1.682.934 inhabitants. Also, it is estimated that GDP/per capita in 2014 will be 8.552.928€ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">At the beginning of the 20th century, Belgrade witnessed several military and political conflicts. Since 1921, Belgrade has been the capital of three successive Yugoslav States - including the rump Yugoslavia from World War II. It should be highlighted that Yugoslavia ran as a Communist Federation. However, with the fall of the Berlin wall and the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia entered a civil war that dismembered Yugoslavia. In fact, Serbia was one of the countries that appeared after the Yugoslav wars. As a result, Belgrade becomes the capital of the Republic of a post-Communist Serbia.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Thus, four main stages represent the city evolution which has (re)shaped its character and basically design: (1) the post-ottoman capital; (2) the capital of a United Yugoslav State; (3) the Communist capital; (4) the post-socialist capital. The above-mentioned war conflicts, consequently have shaped Belgrade´s urban structure. Subsequently, the need for Belgrade to develop as a European metropolis in accordance with European standards reveals the political and intellectual elite need to keep this city in a State of overall development that leaves enough space for political and ideological manipulation, as well as national and social experiments particularly in the Communist period and post-Communist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays, a discontinuous growth of Belgrade is visible through its several "incomplete" urban spaces, which are the direct result of several instability periods. It is also possible to verify that Belgrade's urban development has already entered the current neo-liberal trends. However, such development is not consistent with the provisions of planning principles - according to Vukmirovic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]: "<italic>Given that the current plans are mainly aimed at solving problems arising in the previous period, it could lead to the situation that, in turn, Belgrade would generate the identity which is partially controlled, and which could give rise to an inconsistent image of the city as" well as its competitive identity</italic>."</p>

In fact, Podgorica is the most populous, and Cetinje is the monarchist and historical capital. Podgorica is located in the Northern Zeta plain, at the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers, occupying 10.4% of Montenegro's territory.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The city has 150.977 inhabitants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, these population dynamics is low if compared to other European capitals. It also should be highlighted that the resident population in this city is equivalent to the 29.9 percent of the total of the country. </p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The urban development of Podgorica, have witnessed a remarkable form of this phenomenon in the last 20 - represented with blocks of flats where inhabitants live in poverty and new blocks of flats where the “medium” class lives. The city is socially heterogeneous from the village, so all forms of social differentiation are settled in urban areas. On the emerging urban planning of Podgorica, the process of social stratification in the Mercantile and monetary economy, is mainly reflected in the urban area through segregation phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">In this regard, in several physical plans, buildable areas were planned independently of morphological features of the area or the actual needs and conditions. As a result of such negligence, there are numerous building areas in the vicinity of valuable elements of natural identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>].

The threat of the Ottoman Turks in the mid-17th century, should be considered, once from now on the city began to develop (in a newest way), demolishing old houses and building new palaces, monasteries and churches. Back in 1850, the cities of Gradec and Kaptol and their surrounding settlements became a single administrative unit. Later, in the 19th century, the population multiplied by ten. Being the 20th century marked by the development of the industry and social wealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Thus, Zagreb has undergone major changes caused by the passage of the socialism to capitalism, aligned with the trends of globalization leading to the "disappearance" of urban planning, on the city. Precisely, in the post-socialist era, Zagreb is a city in transition faced by several changes in the social and spatial structure. Such transition to neoliberal capitalism, acquires features of "wild capitalism", since the economic actors driven by materialistic values instigate a construction not planned, random, while the professionals and civilian actors lose power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>In fact, Zagreb is not envisioning plans of revitalization and urban renewal in the short term. In recent years, there has been a lot of construction in the city urban core and their outskirts, which is not well integrated into the existing urban structure. There are also major issues regarding inadequate primary and secondary infrastructure in the new developments. The current state of Zagreb´s planning process is characterized by conflict and lack of balance between the powerful political and economic actors, and less powerful professional and civil actors. In this regard, experts of several fields affirm that ignoring the planning process means irreparable harm in the long term in the space by inconsistent changes that show the absence of a comprehensive urban planning in Zagreb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>].</p>

During this period, Tirana was relatively attractive, clean, quiet, and compact, with considerable free space (now significantly reduced) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>].

The population grew then of less than 300.000 inhabitants in 1990, to 610.050 inhabitants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>].

Such demographic migration and concentration level have been unique in central Europe and Eastern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Subsequently, this city in the post-socialist period has experienced a complete physical, social and economic transformation. But somehow the transformation has been similar to that experienced in other East European capitals post-socialists – here much more drastic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. However, the GDP/per capita is one of the lowest in Europe reaching 700€ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], indicating that the life standards are still low.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The Communist Government increased residential density and adopted a standardized aesthetics of apartment buildings of the low height of several sections (2 to 5 floors), some of them prefabricated. The choice of such typology of urban growth was mainly due to the minimization of the construction costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. Likewise, the city became mono-functional where only there were buildings used for administrative and cultural activities without commercial activities. However, constraints on public resources inevitably hindered the overall achievement of ambitious visions of planning, which resulted in the practice of patchy and erratic, projects, many of which were unfinished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Subsequently, the city produced architectural dynamism and urban development during economic and social transformation, continuously changing the city landscape. The main effects are the densification of the inner city and a considerable increase in construction. This anger of changes reflects the efforts toward modern architecture, new forms, materials, concepts, and approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Then, between 1997 and 2001, urban growth collapsed and there was the occupation of many open spaces and green areas.

Also, the gradual rise of separatist movements among the conquered Nations led to an increase in the relevance of local urban centers. In fact, Skopje was the capital of Kosovo Vilayet after 1864 - was an important strategic city but did not play a particularly prominent role and their influence diminished.

Sarajevo represents an important case of a city in transition with its process of reconstruction of the post-1995 renewal mixed with remains of buildings scattered through the city landscape as silent reminders of the war.

      <title>5. Discussions and conclusions</title>
      <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Although there are differences in urban development between the cities of the Balkans, they all show common patterns and trends of development. The dominant pattern is a neoliberal territorial growth that pretends to be the icon of a new socioeconomic development model, open to capitalism and reducing consumption limitations.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">However, this new model causes huge impacts over the territory. The analyzed cities present a lack of adequate planning, which in the coming years may cause serious social and environmental issues. Thus, it would be advisable that urban planning be stricter both in the pursuit of long-term objectives, and compliance with regulations for the uncontrolled construction.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Adequate urban regulation will avoid enormous environmental and landscape problems as soon as a sustainable urbanization process is achieved. Likewise, in cities where there are still several pieces of land possible to urbanize, urban growth would be continuous throughout the city and not discontinuously, avoiding terrain vague in emblematic cities.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Nevertheless, in those cases where, contrarily, there was no land left possible to urbanize due to a construction vortex that could have been previously produced, it would be pivotal to avoid the urban chaos - of the illegal constructions; if so, it is possible to achieve a more equitable society.</p><p>It also should be considering an expertise opinion–by urban planners - and less the reticence’s of politicians/decision-makers to favor other types of planning–once in several cases it can hide a new form of political order, favoring the most enriched social classes and harming to those poorer social classes.</p>
