      <abstract><p>The integration of heterogeneous medical data remains a major challenge for clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Most existing deep learning (DL) approaches rely primarily on imaging modalities, overlooking the complementary diagnostic value of electronic health records (EHR) and physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG). This study introduces MIMIC-EYE, a secure and explainable multi-modal framework that fuses ECG, chest X-ray (CXR), and MIMIC-III EHR data to enhance diagnostic performance and interpretability. The framework employs a rigorous preprocessing pipeline combining min–max scaling, multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Deep Kalman Filters (DKF), and denoising autoencoders to extract robust latent representations. Multi-modal features are fused through concatenation and optimized using a Hybrid Slime Mould–Moth Flame (HSMMF) strategy for feature selection. The predictive module integrates ensemble DL architectures with attention mechanisms and skip connections to capture complex inter-modal dependencies. Model explainability is achieved through Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), enabling transparent clinical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving 98.41% accuracy, 98.99% precision, and 98.0% sensitivity—outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The proposed MIMIC-EYE framework establishes a secure, interpretable, and generalizable foundation for trustworthy AI-driven decision support in critical care environments.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Diagnosing abnormalities and illnesses from medical images, like chest X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, is known as medical image diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The radiologists and doctors are among the specialists with the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out this task. Nonetheless, data from 2019 indicated a global deficit of healthcare professionals of, 30.6 million, 6.4 million, and 2.9 million, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The problem has gotten worse since healthcare personnel have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. AI-enabled diagnostic systems have emerged as promising ways to assist clinicians, lessen workload, and sustain accurate diagnostic throughput when resources are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Deep Learning (DL) technologies have shown to be highly accurate for diagnostic tasks, including chest X-ray classification for pneumonia and pulmonary nodule and arrhythmia detection from ECG signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], and have been shown to match human expert levels of performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. DL models are inspired by biological neural networks and learn directly from large datasets, and their performance is dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. In this context, our study describes a multi-modal DL framework (MIMIC-Eye) that integrates image, signal, and EHR data to automate and improve clinical decision-making and provide a service that can compensate for the shortage of healthcare workers.</p><p>In addition to giving DL models more reliable data, it can be advantageous to expose other properties of the instances to the approach. Three well-liked DL methods are contrastive learning, multi-tasking, and multi-modal learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. To improve the scenarios' description or extension to models, a range of modalities are used, which improves the scenarios' adaptability and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Multiple input modalities are used in multimodal learning, which helps the model better understand the scenario and see different facets of the input phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. The information gathered from each sensor is then referred to as "modality". Multi-modal data refers to the information gathered when multiple sensors are positioned to view a phenomenon. The system is trained by a variety of tasks that call for different kinds of labels in multi-task learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. A framework will adapt to each task and perform better in generalization when it is acquired from multiple tasks. Using a self-supervised method called contrastive learning, a model is trained to compare and contrast inputs by mapping distinct modes to the similar meaningful vector space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Each of these methods makes use of the extra data provided by the range of modalities.</p><p>The dataset employed in this study is the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Numerous subsets of the MIMIC dataset have been created to offer more details and modalities in response to the dataset's increased popularity. It is essential to incorporate two types of extra data in the study. The patient's clinical information is the first kind. For radiologists to make an accurate diagnosis, clinical data is extremely instructive and necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. When radiologists are diagnosing patients, they collect data that is centered around people. Experts possess the competence of medical diagnosis; thus, it is advantageous to research and examine their patterns of diagnosis. It can investigate the procedures that radiologists use to analyze medical images for human-centric data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>This work offers MIMIC-Eye, a safe and intelligible multi-modal DL framework that leverages federated learning to safeguard patient security and privacy and enhance clinical decision services. The model employs multi-modal learning to integrate new knowledge from ECG signals, chest X-ray images, and EHR data to adequately capture the complete view of each patient’s condition. The model also employs multi-task learning, whereby the model jointly performs related predictive tasks (e.g., disease detection and risk scoring), which can improve the generalisation capabilities of the model. Finally, it leverages contrastive learning during the feature-representation learning step to increase class separability while minimising redundant features. Concatenation and model-based data fusion techniques are used for data fusion following the application of hybrid optimization algorithms, such as the slime mould and moth flame algorithm (HSMMF) for feature selection. To forecast the health condition, ensemble DL approaches with skip connections and attention layers are all combined. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques that combine LIME and SHAP models are utilized to ensure Decision Support system (DSS). The key contributions of the MIMIC-Eye framework are as follows:</p><p>• MIMIC-Eye integrates diverse data sources, specixfically, MIMIC-III EHR data, ECG, and chest X-ray, enhancing the depth and breadth of clinical insights.</p><p>• Relevant features are extracted using specialized techniques to ensure that the most informative features from each dataset are utilized.</p><p>• Combines HSMMF to enhance model performance.</p><p>• Employ a concatenation and modal-based data fusion technique to ensure patient data privacy and security during the data fusion process.</p><p>• Ensemble DL Approaches is developed with Skip Connections and Attention Layers to improve the accuracy and reliability of health condition forecasts.</p><p>• LIME and SHAP Models combined to provide transparent and interpretable DSS enhancing the trust and acceptance of medical professionals in the system.</p><p>The organization of the paper is followed as; section 2 and section 3 detailed related works and problem definition, section 4 elaborates the proposed methodology, section 5 discusses gained results and outcomes, and section 6 ends with a conclusion.</p>

      <p>To lessen the need for manual annotations and hence lower training costs, Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] present the Eye-gaze Guided Multi-modal Alignment (EGMA) model, which uses eye-gaze data to improve image and text feature alignment. The developed method has strong performance, surpassing other cutting-edge techniques in zero-shot categorization and retrieval assignments. Including readily available eye-gaze data in regular radiological diagnosis represents a step toward reducing reliance on manual annotation.</p><p>Hsieh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] develop DL applications in medical imaging that solely employ image data. In this work, it provides a dataset called MIMIC-EYE, which is an extensive integration of several MIMIC-related information. Incorporating data from eye tracking with several MIMIC technologies may provide a better understanding of physicians' visual searching patterns and the development of more reliable, precise, and consistent DL methods for medical image detection.</p><p>Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] suggest a novel way to improve the interaction between people and computers in chest X-ray processing utilizing Vision-Language (VL) systems enriched with radiologists' attention. The suggested method makes use of heatmaps created from eye gaze data, which superimpose on medical images to identify regions of great interest for radiologists while evaluating chest X-rays. Furthermore, eye gazing was shown to have a positive effect on fine-tuning, as it exceeded other medical VLMs in all tests except answering visual questions.</p><p>Hsieh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] introduced EyeXNet, a multimodal DL system that predicts abnormality spots in chest X-rays by integrating images and radiologists' fixation masks. Because radiologists tend to concentrate on abnormally shaped regions and offer predictive algorithms with more specific locations to work with, the developed technique concentrates on fixation maps between reporting moments. Also, compare fixations made by radiologists during quiet and reporting times and find that attachments are more specific and targeted after reporting.</p><p>Hsieh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] presented a unique architecture made up of two fusion algorithms that allow the model to analyze the image data of clinical data, and chest X-rays from patients simultaneously. Also suggest the spatialization approach as a means of spatial organization to support the multimodal learning procedure in a Mask R-CNN approach, given that the modalities of the data are situated in distinct dimensional regions. The findings demonstrate that the suggested fusion approaches enhance the localization of illness in chest X-rays by about 12% based on Average Precision.</p><p>Yin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] concentrate on creating a patient stratification DL algorithm that can recognize and elucidate specific patient groups using multimodal EHRs. Here, create a topic-modeling-based Distinct Multimodal Learning System for EHR (ConMEHR). To create a single image space and diversify patient groups, ConMEHR uses contrastive learning (CL) processes at the modality and topic levels, respectively. The two real-world EHR datasets will be used to assess ConMEHR's performance, and the findings demonstrate better performance.</p><p>Sharif et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] propose a novel automated DL technique for multiclass brain tumor categorization. The Densenet201 Pre-Trained DL Network is trained and refined to utilize a deep transfer of unbalanced data knowledge to implement the suggested strategy. Two feature selection strategies are proposed for a clear classification. A changed genetic algorithm based on the optimization technique is the second method. Ultimately, a multiclass SVM cubic classifier is used to classify the fused EKbHFV and MGA-based features, which, utilizing a distinct serial-based method, were merged.</p><p>Gaw et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] suggest a multi-modality-based diagnostics DSS (MM-DDS). Three interconnected components make up MMI-DDS: a principal component analysis (PCA) to co-register multimodality data, a novel classifier for controlled particle swarm optimization (PSO) from all visualization modalities, and a clinical usefulness engine that uses opposite operations to find imaging features that contribute to the diagnosis of the disease. MMI-DDS demonstrates a much higher level of diagnostic accuracy when compared to the use of single imaging modalities alone.</p><p>Current DL models for clinical decision support are not interpretable, generalise poorly, and process single-modality inputs, which is clinically of little use. To address these issues, MIMIC-Eye combines ECG, chest X-ray, and EHR input to enhance adaptability, employs LIME and SHAP explainability, and ensemble DL with attention for precision. Federated learning maintains data privacy during training and is thus deployable in practice.</p>

      <title>3. Problem definition</title>
      <p>Synchronizing cross-modal features is a major difficulty in multi-modal frameworks. Most emphasis on multimodal pre-training techniques on either global or specific alignment within modalities and employ large datasets. This bottom-up approach frequently has interpretability issues, which pose a serious radiological risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. Radiologists have to evaluate medical images with confidence in their work by utilizing a variety of patient data. Unfortunately, due to a lack of research on medical datasets mixing many data modalities, the majority of DL applications in medical imaging solely employ image data. Arranging and integrating diverse information across several modalities—which includes both organized and unstructured data—is the main problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. In addition, while many computer vision approaches have been put forth that aim to increase classification accuracy, most of these approaches have weaknesses with respect to adaptability, transparency, and clinical relevance. For this reason, none of the existing attempts has transitioned into an applicable, interpretable, and secure clinical decision support system.</p><p>To tackle these gaps, this research proposes MIMIC-Eye, explainable federated multi-modal DL framework, which together utilize ECG, chest X-ray and EHR data. It seeks to address data heterogeneity, improve model interpretability, protect patient privacy and provide trustworthy diagnosis predictions that are also transparent.</p>

      <title>4. Proposed methodology</title>
      <p>In the current healthcare environment, clinical DSS (also known as CDSS) are crucial for assisting doctors in making well-informed judgments. The architecture of the developed model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are numerous challenges in combining different data sources, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and eye tracking. This work offers MIMIC-Eye, a safe and intelligible multi-modal DL framework that leverages federated learning to safeguard patient security and privacy and enhance clinical DSS. MIMIC-Eye integrates MIMIC-III EHR data, ECG data, and chest X-ray data using advanced preprocessing techniques like probabilistic imputation for EHR data, deep Kalman filters for blurring chest X-ray image data, and bandpass filters for ECG data. Using a feature extraction method the domain-specific features and relevant features from each dataset are extracted. Concatenation and model-based data fusion techniques are used for data fusion following the application of hybrid optimization algorithms, such as the HSMMF for feature selection. To forecast the health condition, ensemble DL approaches with skip connections and attention layers are all combined. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques that combine LIME and SHAP models are utilized to ensure DSS. By ensuring explainability and security and improving clinical decision accuracy, the proposed MIMIC-Eye architecture fosters medical professionals' acceptability and trust.</p>

          <p>MIMIC-III EHR data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]: It is still unclear what factors influence the in-hospital mortality of heart failure (HF) patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs). Create and verify a prediction framework for ICU-admitted heart failure patients’ all-cause in-hospital mortality. Data on demographics, vital signs, and laboratory values were taken from the following tables in the MIMIC III dataset: PATIENTS, D LABIEVENTS, ADMISSIONS, NOTEEVENTS, ICUSTAYS, DIAGNOSIS ICD, LABEVENTS, D ICD DIAGNOSIS, CHARTEVENTS, DITEMS, and OUTPUTEVENTS. These characteristics provide the contextual and historical clinical data necessary to understand patient condition and outcomes.</p><p>NIH chest X-ray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]: There are 30,805 distinct patients’ X-ray images (112, 120) with disease labels included in this NIH Chest X-ray Dataset. The labels are intended to be appropriate for weakly-supervised learning and to be more than 90% correct. These images provide spatial information about thoracic pathology such as pneumonia, nodules, and infiltrates.</p><p>ECG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]: This dataset consists of two distinct sets of cardiac signals extracted from two popular databases for heartbeat categorization: the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, which is detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. Both collections include enough number of samples to train a deep neural network. There are several CSV files in this collection. These CSV files are composed of matrices, where each row is an example from that subset of the dataset. Every part of these preprocessed and segmented data represents a heartbeat. This modality captures electrical signals, over a period of time, from the heart to identify arrhythmias and extract patterns of cardiac function that can be used to predict different types of diseases.</p>

          <p>In the context of sensitive patient data processing, de-identification is an important step, especially for effective modeling and healthcare research. By anonymization, direct identifiers such as names, social security values, and other private details are eliminated or hidden from patient data. By doing this, it is ensured that specific patients cannot be easily identified, safeguarding their privacy. Without jeopardizing the anonymity of patients, de-identification preserves the data's usefulness and enables investigators and programmers to use it efficiently for building and training DL models. This procedure is necessary to support the development of healthcare innovations while adhering to moral and regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p>The ground truth values supplied by the dataset serve as a reference signal, and the noisy angle prediction made by the KF is fed into the DKF.</p><p><italic>Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for Image Segmentation</italic></p><p>For this work, a Hidden Markov represent (HMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] based technique is adopted to represent the sequential pattern of human gait. A double-embedded stochastic procedure, of which one is hidden since it can only be viewed through a second stochastic procedure, is what defines an HMM. This random procedure is described using Markov chains. The best match between the supplied data and labels is achieved by selecting the HMM model. The Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) were used to explain the hidden states in the emission patterns for every HMM. The predicted heterogeneity of various transitions and stride parameters, which can be anticipated in data from free-living subjects, were chosen to be modeled by GMMs. Unsupervised training is done on HMMs. Design of the Stride Pattern Every concealed state corresponded to a stride's subphase. The total number of states in the framework determined the time granularity for these subphases. This indicates that a monotonic rising state sequence is used to convey each step <inline-formula>

          <p><italic>Bandpass Filter for ECG Data</italic></p><p>For the ECG, the first filtering technique's result is noise reduction utilizing the bandpass filter, which consists of a low-pass filter transmitted by a high-pass filter. A low-pass filter is used to reduce high-frequency interference. The use of digital filters with numerical coefficients in the design of filters enables real-time processing capacities. Speed is high since floating point processing is not needed. Eq. (13) illustrates the transfer function of the second-class low-pass filter.</p>

ResNet‐18 is a member of the ResNet‐xx network group. A ReLU layer, an average pooling layer, five convolutional layers for gathering deep feature maps, and a fully connected layer for transforming feature maps from two dimensions to one as well as categorizing all input images characterized by feature vectors through the appropriate class of ResNet-18 network's eighteen deep layers. Finally, gather the features from the chest X-Ray images using the softMax activation function. The ResNet-18 model's architecture, with numerous layers and about 11.5 million parameters, is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

The heart rate, expressed in beats per minute (BPM), is the quantity of heartbeats per unit of time. Length of the ECG signal's P, T, QRS complex, and S waves. The ECG signal's RR interval is the interval of time between consecutive R waves.

          <p>The best feature is selected with a fused dataset using slime mould optimization (SMO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], and Mothflame optimization (MFO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] called the HSMMF model.</p><p><italic>Process of HSMMF</italic></p><p>Larvae and adults are the two major life stages for moths. Within cocoons, the larvae transform into moths. The unique ways that moths navigate at night are the most fascinating aspect of their biology. They have learned to use the light of the full moon to fly at night. For navigation, they used a system known as transverse orientation. This technique uses a very efficient mechanism to keep the moth flying at a constant angle to the moon. The SMA actively seeks out a food source while taking on the form of the acellular Slime Mould (SM). Because of its unique anatomy, which enables it to create intricate venous networks connecting all of its food sources simultaneously, Slime Mould can accomplish this. Tubular veins circulate with the cytoplasm when Slime Moulds' biochemical oscillator detects a food source and sends contraction waves throughout the vein system. For the Slime Mould to locate food sources, it needs both positive and negative input. There are three stages to it: oscillation, wrap food, and approach food.</p><p><italic>Approach Food</italic></p><p>Based on the smell that food releases, Slime Mould may reach it. The contraction mode can be replicated using the following calculation methods, which can also be used to interpret the contraction phase's approaching behavior. A method for approaching food is found in Eq. (31).</p>

</inline-formula>\vec{Z}_{b(t)}$, that has just been acquired.</p><p><italic>Wrap Food</italic></p><p>This part simulates the device of venous tissue contraction used by SM during searching. More food intake causes the cytoplasm to flow more quickly, the bio-oscillator to produce a extra substantial wave, and the vein to become more noticeable. The situation that causes Slime Mould to alter its foraging tactics in answer to the quality of the food is mimicked. The weight in the location increases when there is sufficient food nearby; whenever there is not sufficient food nearby, the region loses relevance and the creature shifts its attention to other areas to investigate. In this stage, each moth's position about a flame is modified, exhibiting a spiral motion behavior. Eq. (37) is the calculation for the mathematical method utilized to update the SM’s location.</p>

This algorithm's CNN consists of several filter layers that organize throughout the input data to find pertinent features. A series of feature maps that are passed into the LSTM network comprise the CNN's output. The time-dependent relationships in the input data are captured by the LSTM network. The sequence of inputs of feature maps serves as the basis for training the multiple layers of LSTM cells that make up the LSTM network. A series of hidden states are produced by the LSTM network and supplied into the attention layer. The attention layer is used to intelligently focus on the relevant parts of the input pattern by weighing the importance of every hidden state in the output sequence. This increases the predicted accuracy of the system and helps it extract the most pertinent information given the input data. To do this, every hidden state's concentration score is first determined according to how relevant it is to the prediction job. The attention layer's output is then obtained by computing the weighted total of the value vectors using the weight vector. The attention layer can collect different facets of the input data since it might have many heads. Moreover, the skip incorporates the outputs of the Attention and LSTM layers to expand the model's capacity. It enables the model to take advantage of both layers' advantages and complementing qualities. The Attention layer concentrates on significant portions of the input sequence, while the LSTM layer records dependencies over time and encodes contextual data. Integrating their outputs can enhance the model's capacity to recognize intricate patterns and produce a fuller representation.</p><p>Let $K<inline-formula>

          <p>To clarify the model's predictions and shed light on how eye gazing and EHR data inform decision-making, incorporate XAI approaches (LIME, SHAP). This has the potential to increase acceptability and trust among medical practitioners.</p><p><italic>Local Interpretable Model-Agnostics Explanations (LIME)</italic></p><p>LIME is part of a larger class of removal-based explanations, which quantify the significance of features by statistically modeling their removal to prove feature importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. LIME's primary features are its model-agnostic and local nature. A linear approximation near the choice point can provide a localized explanation, even though the global decision boundary may be convoluted and squiggly. Parts of the information required for the prediction are identified by the localized explanation, which adds to the explanations' intuitiveness and understandability. The majority of individuals would be satisfied with a straightforward, localized explanation, but complex edge cases, including uncommon medical disorders, require consideration in the global decision model. The decision-maker can also identify possible errors in the logic of the model by emphasizing the input parameters that influenced the choice.</p><p>The estimate for a certain instance $a$ for an underlying system is represented in Eq.

          <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref> illustrates the comparison of various performance metrics for a developed technique model with and without feature selection. The green bars represent the scores achieved with feature selection, while the red bars represent the scores without feature selection. From the graph, it is evident that the proposed model performs better across most metrics when feature selection is applied. This indicates that feature selection enhances the model's ability to correctly identify relevant patterns in the data, leading to improved overall performance. Conversely, the metrics FPR and FNR, which ideally should be lower, also reflect the benefits of feature selection.</p><p>Overall, the graph demonstrates that incorporating feature selection into the model training process results in more accurate and reliable predictions, highlighting the importance of selecting the most relevant features for optimal model performance. Also, the performance of the feature fusion with concatenate fusion and modal-based fusion is validated with accuracy, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_17">Figure 17</xref>.</p><p>The modal-based fusion gained higher performance while comparing concatenate fusion models. It shows the effectiveness of the developed model to predict the disease.

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>To improve radiologists' choices, we tackle the problem of integrating numerous data modalities in medical imaging in this study. Through the use of an extensive dataset that includes ECG, NIH chest X-ray, and MIMIC-III EHR data, we go beyond the conventional image-only method in the realm of medical DL applications. The proposed methodology uses cutting-edge techniques like min-max scaling and MICE for efficient preprocessing of EHR data. HMMs are utilized for segmentation and Deep Kalman Filters and Denoising Autoencoders are used for denoising to enhance the quality of image data. Concatenation and modal-based feature fusion are utilized to ensure secure data integration by merging features from chest X-ray pictures, ECG, and EHR without disclosing the raw data. The system's ability to assess the significance of every data modality for certain prediction tasks is made possible by the incorporation of an attention mechanism grounded in Ensemble DL models. This improves the interpretability and performance of the model. Moreover, transparency in model predictions is achieved through LIME and SHAP techniques, which offer insights into the impact of different data features on the model's decisions. The gained experimental outcomes are validated with existing DL techniques and gained impressive accuracy of 0.9841, precision of 0.9899, sensitivity of 0.98, NPV of 0.9778, less FPR of 0.0112, and FNR of 0.02.</p>
