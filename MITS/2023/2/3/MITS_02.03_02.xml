      <abstract><p>In the quest for autonomous vehicle safety and road infrastructure management, traffic sign recognition (TSR) remains paramount. Recent advancements in accuracy across various benchmarks have been identified in the literature concerning this essential task. Such technology might remain absent in older vehicles, while integration into Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is common in more recent models. Yet, the capability of these systems to function proficiently under diverse driving conditions has not been widely investigated. A framework has been devised to allow a moving vehicle to detect traffic signs, targeting the enhancement of driver safety and the diminishment of accidents. The present research introduces an innovative methodology, amalgamating the extreme learning machine (ELM) method with deep-learning paradigms, in response to experimental discoveries. As a pioneering computational approach in neural network-based learning, ELM facilitates rapid training and commendable generalization. An accuracy of 95.00% was achieved by the proposed model. By utilizing the Horse Herd Optimization method (HHOA), the memory consumption is minimized in the more sophisticated approach of stacked ELM (SELM) within the deep-learning framework. This study contributes to the understanding of potential challenges that may be encountered during TSR tasks, and lays the groundwork for future investigation by proffering a diverse set of evaluations for various road scenarios. Consistency in the utilization of professional terms is maintained throughout.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The advent of technology has heralded the incorporation of safety-enhancing driving aids that form the backbone of autonomous vehicles and ADAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Developed to facilitate rapid and accurate response to potentially hazardous traffic scenarios, these systems have become a crucial aspect of automotive safety and comfort, thus warranting considerable scholarly interest and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. A diverse array of technologies contributes to the development of ADAS systems, among which camera-based solutions are notable for their cost-effectiveness, facilitated by the evolution of computer vision technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>As population increments, so does the number of vehicles, leading to a proportional rise in accidents and fatalities. The increasing risks are further amplified by factors such as fatigue, poor driving conditions, and distractions, necessitating the development of solutions aimed at minimizing traffic accidents and bolstering driver safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>ADAS critically rely on external environment sensing, which involves data collection from extravehicular sources including vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. However, the efficiency of environmental perception can be hindered by external variables like weather, traffic volume, and lighting conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Thus, when devising ADAS systems, these potential confounders should be taken into account. Increasing vehicular volume escalates the potential for accidents and fatalities, a threat that can be effectively mitigated by ADAS and autonomous driving systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Harnessing computer vision technology, camera-based solutions offer financial feasibility and superior image analysis capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. However, designing ADAS systems requires careful consideration of environmental variables such as weather, road conditions, and lighting.</p><p>TSR systems, an essential feature of intelligent vehicles, include two critical phases: detection and categorization of road signs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Despite advancements in these systems, they exhibit several drawbacks. The lack of studies evaluating the efficiency of deep learning-based TSR in real-world noisy urban settings is conspicuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Given the considerable discrepancies in benchmark images and actual urban scenes, it becomes imperative to evaluate the types of noise and validate the recognition outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Moreover, TSR schemes rarely incorporate object-tracking models in conjunction with detection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Lastly, the performance of deep learning-based models in vehicles equipped with smart cameras needs further improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>Addressing these issues, the current study presents a framework for TSR complete with a testbed for validating the system's accuracy and latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. A computing unit and server were installed in a vehicle to allow the system to recognize traffic signs in real-world conditions. Different types of noise were identified in urban road environments, and road images were clustered based on their corresponding conditions. Subsequent analysis and iterations of object detection models led to accuracy and latency evaluations under various environmental scenarios. This comprehensive approach aids in unearthing potential challenges in traffic sign identification tasks, setting the stage for future studies.</p><p>The significant findings from this study include:</p><p>•A novel TSR framework, which leverages the benefits of the ELM within a deep learning-based object detection model, the SELM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>•An enhanced memory usage via SELM, achieved by dividing a large neural network into smaller, serially computed ones, which increases learning accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>•Empirical evidence for the effectiveness of deep learning-based tracking models in diverse environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>•A comprehensive analysis to guide future research on TSR schemes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>This study is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of existing models; Section 3 offers a succinct explanation of the proposed work; Section 4 presents a discussion of the validation analysis. The final results and suggestions for future research are discussed in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.</p>

            <title>2.3. Recent methodologies in tsr</title>
          
          <p>TSR is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, and research in this field has witnessed a progression of methodologies with distinctive contributions.</p><p>Triki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] initiated a trend by combining the Haar cascade method with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, achieving an accuracy of 98.56% on the GTSRB dataset. This milestone laid a solid foundation for further exploration, particularly regarding enhanced classifiers in TSR. The attention-based deep CNN subsequently proposed, boasting superior testing rates of 99.91% and 99%, sparked interest in more focused detection methods.</p><p>Following this path, Torres et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] addressed the identification accuracy issue by proposing a combination of edge detection filters and fuzzy inference systems. The approach emphasized the importance of pre-processing layers and demonstrated competitive results. The continuity of this method from Triki's foundation illustrates the growing complexity and refinement in TSR.</p><p>Integrating this notion of complexity, Chung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] introduced a paradigm shift by employing the YOLO v5 construction with an attentional deconvolution detector (FSADD). Recognizing the limitations of previous detection methods, this novel approach provided an accuracy of 73.9%, bridging the gap between conventional techniques and cutting-edge standards.</p><p>In a response to the challenge of efficiency, Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] leveraged the advancements made by Chung and others by designing a lightweight neural network. Achieving accuracy rates of 98.41% and 92.06%, this approach offered a streamlined yet effective method, reflecting a move towards optimal performance with reduced complexity. Building on the need for broader application, Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] extensively explored the integration of TSR in traffic management. The Graph Cooperation model with self-attention mechanisms unveiled new horizons in traffic signal control. This progression not only aligned with the previous research but also opened doors to holistic traffic management solutions.</p><p>Enhancing this direction, Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] iImplemented the teacher-student structure to guide the student agent, adding a novel dimension to RL-based traffic signal control strategies. This inventive method provided a seamless transition from Yan's cooperative models, portraying an evolving landscape in intelligent traffic control.</p><p>Concluding the trajectory, Gu and Si [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] consolidated previous insights to craft a YOLO-based system for real-time TSR. By optimizing latency and enabling applicability in constrained hardware, this work epitomized the culmination of ongoing efforts in TSR, reflecting adaptability and resource-efficiency.</p><p>Through the methodological progression outlined above, it is evident that the field of TSR has undergone a significant evolution, characterized by innovation, specialization, and integration into broader traffic management contexts. The collective body of work presented here not only portrays individual advancements but also illustrates a coherent narrative of growth and development in TSR.</p>

          <p>Despite significant progress, certain challenges remain in the TSR systems. Key issues include:</p><p>•Robustness: Existing systems suffer from a lack of reliability, especially in handling varying illumination, weather, and occlusions. This lack of robustness has been observed under different illumination conditions.</p><p>•Scalability: Current technologies often face difficulties in scalability, particularly when adapting to new conditions or expanding datasets.</p><p>•Interpretability: A general lack of transparency in decision-making within current TSR technologies hampers efforts to debug and optimize systems, which could potentially erode trust in their reliability.</p>

            <title>3.1. Dataset description: indian road traffic signal categories</title>
          
          <p>The proper function of road traffic signals offers substantial benefits to vehicles, drivers, passengers, and property. Within the Indian context, road signage can be classified into three principal categories:</p><p>(a) Mandatory or Regulatory Symbols: Compliance with these signs is required by law, with legal consequences for non-adherence.</p><p>(b) Cautionary Warning Symbols: These signs serve to alert drivers to impending hazards, construction activities, or accidents.</p><p>(c) Informatory Symbols: These signs facilitate travel by providing guidance on direction, nearby facilities such as restaurants, motels, rest stops, and petrol stations, etc.</p><p>In this study, a custom dataset is utilized, comprising 6480 images and 7056 instances of traffic signs, subdivided into 100 categories. Thirteen out of the 100 categories pertain to traffic signs, derived from authoritative sources such as the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) dataset, exhibiting similarity to their Indian counterparts. The remaining 1936 images were procured from public domain websites.</p><p>Of the total images, 4544 were sourced from real-world scenarios and classified into 87 traffic sign categories. Resolution variation was noted, with over 70% of the images being of higher resolution (4128 × 2322 pixels, 774 × 1032 pixels, 960 × 1280 pixels), and the remaining 29% of lower resolution (225 × 225 pixels, 200 × 200 pixels). Furthermore, 200 images contain two occurrences of a traffic sign, 40 with three, and 32 with four. Visibility was predominantly clear at 97%, with a minor 3% exhibiting reduced visibility. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] offers examples from the custom dataset.</p><p>Images within the custom dataset were categorized into two classes, one featuring signs exceeding 30 pixels in resolution and the other exceeding 50 pixels. Exceptional cases, such as multiple occurrences of the same sign in a photograph, were consistently excluded in both training and testing stages.</p><p>The predominance of traffic signs was observed to exceed 30 pixels. The adopted model in this research employs the standard test split ratio of 80:20, thereby ensuring a minimum of 6 images in each category. Separation of the datasets into training and testing sets was carried out arbitrarily, resulting in 5664 images designated for the training dataset and 1412 for the testing phase.</p><p>By offering a comprehensive view of the dataset, including the categorization and characteristics of the images, this section establishes the foundation for the proposed system. This dataset description aligns with the broader focus on Indian road traffic signal categories, reflecting the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios.</p>

            <title>3.2. Pre-processing for enhanced accuracy</title>
          
          <p>The process for sign identification and recognition within the proposed system necessitates three primary pre-processing stages: shape detection, region of interest (ROI) determination, and color probability analysis.</p><p>•Shape Detection: The commencement of pre-processing focuses on isolating the geometrical characteristics from captured video scenes. Color images are initially converted to black and white, allowing for the determination of contour values through an OpenCV-derived contour detection algorithm. Subsequent computation of the area, based on these values and user-defined threshold values, facilitates the detection of the traffic sign's shape in accordance with the counter's area. The resultant images are then conveyed to the ROI component.</p><p>•ROI: The determination of the ROI is instrumental in precisely locating the traffic sign within an image. Triangles, rectangles, and circles, which commonly depict traffic signs in India, can be identified as the ROI by the proposed model. Anomalies within an image, such as a larger area, can prolong the estimation time or render the predictions inaccurate. Three distinct algorithms are employed to locate the ROI within an image. In instances where the ROI is circular, the Hough Circle program is used to identify triangles and squares. Various algorithms cater to the finding of edges and contours, with unique ROI calculations and coloring codes specific to each shape (circle, rectangle, triangle). Images are extracted from the ROI without distortion by cropping them with a 5% threshold, and subsequent colorization precedes the transition to the color probability stage.</p><p>•Color Probability: This stage entails the creation of a novel dataset, comprising the RGB values for each pixel in the sample image. Visibility testing under diverse lighting conditions, including bright sunlight, diffused sunlight, and complete darkness, serves to determine the range of RGB pixel values. A real-range derived from the image collection is used to compute the percentage of pixels that are red, black, and white. A counter corresponding to red, black, or white is incremented based on the pixel range. Analysis of the dataset reveals variations in RGB pixel counts between images captured with and without direct sunlight. Post color probability, the image is relayed to the model, with a cutoff value ascertained from the training dataset. The range for each color is computed and applied during color probability, considering additional images from the dataset. The total number of RGB pixels is obtained as follows:</p>

</inline-formula>T=\left[\left[t_i\right]_{i=1}^N\right]^{\top}$ represents the target matrix. </p><p>•SELM Framework: The architecture of SELM, inspired by deep learning models, is constructed through a layered ELM with a multilayer NN, as described by Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. This division is achieved by introducing a novel ELM architecture in the first layer, wherein all hidden layer neurons' parameters are randomly generated. In the subsequent layers, some parameters are propagated after being scaled down, thus constraining the extent to which the remaining parameters are randomly generated. Following the training of one layer, the data input to that layer is relayed to the next, culminating in the final layer. Thus, the multilayer ELM structure constitutes the deep learning model.</p><p>The first-layer optimization problem can be formulated as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]:</p>

</inline-formula>\gamma$.</p><p>The hierarchy's embodiment in these mathematical formulations serves to highlight the adaptive nature of the swarm, ensuring that the influence of the leader on the followers is precisely calibrated. This adaptation ensures that the search space is explored efficiently, guided by the leader but also allowing for individual variation among the followers. Consequently, the inclusion of hierarchy within the model adds depth and complexity to the understanding of how social interactions are simulated in the HHOA, offering insights into how these mechanisms may be translated into more efficient optimization strategies.</p><p>C. Sociability</p><p>The group dynamics of horses, mirroring the behavior of numerous other social animals, offer a compelling example of collaborative survival strategies. This cohesiveness, defined by cooperative defense and enhanced escape capability, is encapsulated in the HHOA algorithm through the coefficient s, representing the sociability factor. This factor is characterized by a systematic movement towards the mean position of the horses in the swarm and can be mathematically expressed as:</p>

</inline-formula>\vec{s}_m^{t, A G E}$ is updated according to Eq. (19).</p><p>The sociability aspect of the model elucidates the intricate dynamics of interaction among horses, mirroring real-world herd behavior. By modeling this aspect, insights are gained into the nature of collaborative decision-making and cooperative strategies within the swarm. It may also offer broader implications for understanding social interactions among other species, potentially informing the development of innovative algorithms or approaches that mimic these natural dynamics.</p><p>The addition of sociability into the model not only increases the realism of the simulations but may also enhance the efficiency of the algorithm by encouraging a more cohesive exploration of the search space. The intricate interplay between individual exploration and group cohesion, captured in the equations above, contributes to the sophistication of the model and its potential applications in various optimization problems.</p><p>D. Imitation</p><p>A horse can pick up on the habits and mannerisms of other horses very quickly. This means the horse can learn both the positive and harmful habits of its peers. The mathematical formula that describes the social behaviour of imitation is as follows:</p>

By accounting for the tendency to escape adverse situations, the mathematical representation allows for a nuanced understanding of survival strategies. This defense parameter not only aligns with observed behavior but also contributes to the overall robustness of the model in various applications.</p><p>In addition, the concept of defense, as expressed in the equations, serves to fortify the underlying algorithm's adaptive capabilities. By incorporating both attraction (as noted in previous sections) and repulsion within the dynamics, the model may offer insights into multifaceted social behaviors beyond the specific context of horses. Such balanced interaction mechanisms might find applications in various computational models seeking to replicate complex social interactions.</p><p>F.

This attribute is mathematically depicted through the following equations:</p>

By allowing for a stochastic component, the mathematical representation embodies the unpredictable nature of these movements. This aspect of random wandering may be instrumental in understanding the patterns and dynamics that influence the mobility of horses in their natural habitats.</p><p>Furthermore, the consideration of roaming aligns with an overarching theme of nuanced social behaviors that has been a focal point in this section. Through these mathematical characterizations, a multidimensional understanding of herd behavior, social dynamics, and survival strategies can be obtained. The ability to capture such complex behaviors through mathematical equations opens avenues for applying these models to other species or even human social dynamics, where random movements and interactions are also prevalent.</p>

      <title>4. Results and discussion</title>
      <p>The TSR system underwent initial evaluation on a specific Windows PC setup, comprised of an i57200 Intel® Core™ processor, 8 GB RAM, and 64-bit architecture. Subsequently, assessment was conducted on a Raspberry Pi 4 board Classical B, equipped with a 64-bit CPU and 8 GB RAM. The computational resources were augmented with a separate storage server and central processing unit. An independent archive for camera footage was facilitated using a NEOUSYS 930 GB storage server. Further, inference on the trained model was performed using an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier edge device, integrated with a 512-core NVIDIA Volta™ GPU.</p>

          <p>Inspiration drawn from the prior description of meteorological features in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] guided the proposal of novel classes to capture unique ecological circumstances in urban road scenes. Factors such as seasonal influences, topographical features, and the presence or absence of roads were identified as elements capable of modifying natural settings. The implications of these elements were observed to bear significant influence on TSR, even when employing identical traffic signs. Consequently, taxonomies were constructed for various traffic circumstances, and training images were compiled in alignment with these classifications. The dataset included observations made under diverse conditions such as pristine, cloudy, tunnel, night, rain, and sunny weather. The detailed classifications are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Standardized forms and colors were adhered to for the signs in order to facilitate accurate information transmission to drivers. Specifically, warning signs, characterized by their triangular shape, serve to notify drivers of hazardous or challenging road conditions. Regulatory signs, in contrast, alert drivers to prohibitions or limitations on driving conditions and are circular in form with a borderless blue background. Indication signs, guiding drivers directionally, follow this pattern as well. Examples of these three principal sign types—warnings, regulations, and indications—are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

          <p>Emerging technologies in this context constitute the foundation for advanced systems and autonomous vehicles. ADAS were developed to support both drivers and vehicles in recognizing and responding to potential hazardous driving conditions. The primary objective of these devices is the reduction of accident frequency on roads and the enhancement of driver safety. Integration of ADAS into the dashboard electronics of modern automobiles has become standard, though such integration is often absent in older vehicles.</p>

            <title>4.4. Shortcomings and limitations of the implemented approaches</title>
          
          <p>The conducted study and the corresponding results do highlight several potential shortcomings and areas where further refinement or exploration is warranted. These are enumerated as follows:</p><p>•Utilization of Color Information: The study primarily relied on grayscale images, ostensibly to simplify computation and reduce complexity. While this approach has merits, it may simultaneously deprive the model of valuable information inherent in the full color spectrum. Colors, especially in the context of TSR, may carry significant distinguishing features crucial for accurate categorization. An exploration into how the RGB color model could be effectively integrated without unduly increasing computational burden should be considered in future work.</p><p>•Necessity for Expanded Training Data: The scarcity of training data for specific classes, such as Classes 0, 41, and 42, emerged as a limitation. An expansion of the dataset, particularly for under-represented classes, would likely lead to a more balanced and robust model.</p><p>•Imbalance in Training Data Across Classes: A marked variation was observed in the quantity of training data samples available across different classes. This imbalance manifested in a tendency for the model to recognize classes with larger sample sizes more accurately. Additional efforts to rectify this imbalance, possibly through techniques like data augmentation or synthetic data generation, could enhance the generalization capabilities of the model.</p><p>•Possible Extension: It may be beneficial to explore additional preprocessing or feature engineering techniques to mitigate some of the identified limitations. A systematic evaluation of various preprocessing methodologies and their impact on model performance could represent a fruitful direction for future research.</p><p>These observations provide essential insights into the limitations of the implemented approaches and suggest clear pathways for further research and development. Addressing these shortcomings might lead to substantial improvements in the efficacy and robustness of TSR systems.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The burgeoning field of automated safety technologies, with a view towards eventual deployment in fully autonomous vehicles, places an imperative on the development of robust and error-free systems. Among these, the TSR system, characterized by real-time automatic recognition of traffic signs, stands as a critical component within both ADAS and ADS. In this context, the present research introduced a method designed to fulfill stringent criteria pertaining to accuracy and processing time.</p><p>The study's proposed approach involved the development of a novel TSR system, employing a machine learning model classifier known as the SELM, with optimal parameters determined through the use of the HHOA model. It was observed that the recognition rate must meet exceedingly high standards, as the implications of error in this sphere can be profound. The approach delineated herein is posited to align with these stringent requirements, contributing to a paradigm that underpins both current advancements in vehicle safety and future strides towards full autonomy.</p><p>The research has laid foundational groundwork but also illuminated avenues for future exploration. Environmental factors, such as motion blur, color fading, unwanted light interference, occlusion, and weather conditions like rain and snow, have not been incorporated into the dataset. The integration of these complex real-world scenarios represents a logical next step in the refinement of the TSR system.</p><p>Moreover, future iterations of the model may benefit from the application of cutting-edge deep learning techniques, further enhancing the capability of the ADAS to detect road obstacles. Exploration of innovative strategies to bolster real-time detection speed and accuracy is also warranted.</p><p>The current landscape of TSR research has revealed a tendency towards redundancy, a condition that can impede practical application. A focused effort to diversify the scope of the project could involve an expansion into the nuanced study of traffic signs specific to different geographical regions, such as New Zealand. Additionally, the incorporation of advanced object recognition methods, such as heatmap techniques, and the employment of alternative evaluation metrics may contribute to a more holistic understanding of model performance.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study's insights and proposed method offer a promising direction in the field of TSR. The identified limitations and suggested pathways for future research contribute to an evolving narrative that resonates with the broader movement towards enhanced vehicle safety and autonomy. The continuance of this research trajectory is poised to yield innovations with far-reaching impacts on transportation systems and society at large.</p>
