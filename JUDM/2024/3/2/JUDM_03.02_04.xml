      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Urban development and economic growth are intricately intertwined, shaping the trajectory of cities worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. As cities evolve into epicenters of economic activity, understanding the dynamics of economic development within urban settings becomes paramount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Economic development in cities encompasses a complex interplay of factors, ranging from infrastructure investment to entrepreneurial ecosystems, from social equity to environmental sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Exploring these dynamics not only illuminates the forces propelling urban economies forward but also underscores the challenges and opportunities inherent in fostering inclusive and sustainable urban development.</p><p>Despite the wealth of literature on economic development and urbanization, certain gaps persist in our understanding of this multifaceted phenomenon. While numerous studies have examined economic development from macroeconomic perspectives, there remains a need for nuanced analyses that delve into the micro-level intricacies of urban economic dynamics. Moreover, the literature often overlooks the interdisciplinary nature of urban development, neglecting to integrate insights from diverse fields such as social sciences, environmental studies, and engineering.</p><p>In light of these gaps, there is a pressing need to conduct comprehensive bibliometric analyses to map the landscape of economic development research within cities. By synthesizing existing literature, identifying trends, and uncovering research priorities, such analyses can inform future scholarly endeavors and policy interventions aimed at fostering sustainable and inclusive urban economies.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of economic development research within cities. By leveraging the extensive repository of the Scopus database, this analysis aims to: (1) Identify longitudinal trends in publications related to economic development in cities. (2) Explore the distribution of publication types and subject areas within this thematic domain. (3) Investigate the geographical distribution of research contributors and organizational affiliations driving scholarly discourse on urban economic development. (4) Examine prominent themes and emerging research areas to elucidate current research trajectories and identify future directions for scholarly inquiry.</p><p>The subject of urban economic development is complex and far-reaching, touching on everything from infrastructure investment to entrepreneurial ecosystems to social equity and environmental sustainability. Even though there is an abundant literature method available, several reasons justify why bibliometric analysis becomes necessary. First, in identifying research gaps, the macroeconomic part is well catered to in the existing literature, much less so if we look at micro-level complexities. Bibliometric analysis can systematically identify these gaps by mapping the current landscape and pointing out areas that need more research. The second is interdisciplinary integration. City economic development is an intersecting field of study, touching on social sciences, environmental studies, engineering, and others. Current research may need to draw more from these related disciplines. The depth of interdisciplinary collaboration and how it may be improved can be observed through the bibliometric analysis process. Third, urban economic development is dynamic, with trends and hotspots continually shifting. Bibliometric analysis can trace these longitudinal patterns and provide a historical view of how the research focus has evolved or will evolve. Lastly, information on policy/practice. However, contemporary and detailed information on which policymakers and metropolis organizers rely is not offered. By synthesizing existing research and using bibliometric analysis and finding new emerging themes, we can provide insights into how policies and practices.</p><p>Using a large dataset from the Scopus database, this study surveys research on economic development in cities. This involves looking at types of publications, subjects, and the locations where studies have been contributed. Through a systematic review of publications between 1973 and 2024, this study will unveil longitudinal trends, shedding light on how interest in urban economic development has shifted. This can help identify entire periods of high research output and critical moments in the field. The study will determine the leading themes and topics from urban economic development literature. Thematic findings Analysis of the themes enables future research to benefit from identifying current emphasis and potential novel trajectories for scientific investigation.</p><p>This study will offer a comprehensive overview of urban economic development research internationally. It does this by examining the geographic distribution of author participation and institutional affiliation, which gives insights into regional disparities and global patterns in academic collaboration. The study, therefore, offers a more holistic understanding by mapping linkages within and between sectors.</p><p>This study should provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and academic researchers. It adds to previous literature by offering a more nuanced view of the interdisciplinary nature of urban economic development, informing policy interventions, and linking planning practices with academic research to create sustainable and inclusive economies.</p>

            </fig>
          
          <p>Cluster 1, identified by the red color theme, encompasses a spectrum of themes central to economic development discourse, including business development, development strategy, economic development, economic growth, economic planning, economic policy, employment, globalization, human capital, industrial development, local economic development, metropolitan area, quality of life, regional development, socioeconomic conditions, sustainability, urban development, urban economy, urban growth, urban planning, and several other themes. This cluster represents a comprehensive array of topics encapsulating the multifaceted dimensions of economic development within urban contexts.</p><p>The substantive implications of this result are that the prevalence with which economic development themes are represented emphasizes cities as key levers and stakeholders in the (innovative) global economy. It leveraged the insights to identify how scholars and policymakers can leverage those in Cluster 1 for strategies that will support sustainable economic development, urban resilience, and inclusive growth.</p><p>Cluster 2, characterized by the green color theme, focuses on themes related to environmental sustainability and socio-economic development. Key themes within this cluster include carbon emissions, cities, economic aspects, gross domestic product, gross national product, industry, policy, land use, social development, socio-economic development, urban area, urban population, urbanization, and several other themes. The thematic coherence within this cluster underscores the interconnectedness between environmental considerations and socio-economic progress within urban settings, highlighting the imperative of sustainable development paradigms.</p><p>This result suggests that policymakers may use Cluster 2 as a base for implementing comprehensive and systemic (urban) policies toward supporting green infrastructure development efficiency and resilience. This focus on development, not simply sustainability, but the emphasis being put more and more on socio-economics above environmental sustainability, presents an ideal annex for inter-disciplinary and practice-research integration to face complicated urban challenges successfully.</p><p>Cluster 3, denoted by the blue color theme, revolves around themes concerning environmental quality and pollution mitigation strategies. Core themes within this cluster include air pollution, air quality, atmospheric pollution, emission control, environmental economics, environmental policy, environmental pollution, environmental protection, resource-based cities, sustainable development, and several other themes. This cluster underscores the growing recognition of environmental sustainability imperatives in urban development discourse, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to address environmental degradation and promote ecological resilience.</p><p>This outcome is paramount, as it provides crucial policy implications for urban fosters in Cluster 3. These implications can help them arrange specific empowerments and set means to improve air quality directly, reinforce environmental preservation policies, and correct urban pollution. The Centre's Theme of Sustainability and Pollution Control underscores the urgency of these findings. The Centre aims to develop novel solutions, processes, and technologies for urban environmental management through research projects focusing on various cities' sustainability issues.</p><p>Cluster 4, represented by the olive green color theme, encompasses themes related to economic analysis, efficiency, industrial structure, and regional economic development. Key themes within this cluster include agglomeration, economic analysis, economic and social effects, efficiency, heterogeneity, high-quality economic development, industrial structure, railroad transportation, regional economic development, and several other themes. This cluster reflects economic development research's analytical and empirical dimensions, focusing on factors influencing economic efficiency, industrial dynamics, and regional disparities in economic growth and development.</p><p>Consequently, the implications of this finding in insight from Cluster 4 can provide support to policymakers and urban planners dealing with different policy objectives aiming at either promoting balanced regional development patterns (or enabling economic diversification more broadly) across disparate areas spiraling outwards away from floodplains or achieving equity between existing economies as they increasingly clump closer together. The cluster's industrial dynamics orientation allows for research collaborations that can provide a more comprehensive picture of the urban economic system and open avenues for designing policy measures based on empirical evidence.</p><p>Cluster 5, distinguished by the purple or lavender color theme, centers on energy utilization, industrial economics, infrastructure, and tourism themes. Key themes within this cluster include carbon, economic growth, energy utilization, environmental management, industrial economics, infrastructure, smart cities, and tourism. This cluster highlights the interplay between energy dynamics, industrial activities, infrastructure development, and tourism promotion in shaping urban economic trajectories and fostering sustainable urban development pathways.</p><p>Urban policymakers can use the insights from Cluster 5 to inform their decision-making on investments in smart infrastructure, renewable energy technologies, and sustainable urban mobility solutions. The cluster's approach to energy dynamics and infrastructure development underscores combined approaches that optimize resource use, reduce environmental footprints, and strengthen urban resilience.</p><p>The thematic clusters identified through bibliometric analysis play a crucial role in shaping the future of economic development in cities research. They not only highlight established and emerging research themes but also provide a unique perspective on the evolution of scholarly discourse. More importantly, they map out potential areas of future inquiry and guide policy interventions. By addressing the interplay between economic, environmental, and social dimensions of urban infrastructure, researchers can collaborate with policymakers to shape more inclusive urban futures.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> provides a nuanced insight into the temporal evolution of research themes concerning ``Economic Development in Cities."

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>The bibliometric analysis adds a layer of understanding to the evolution, dispersal, and thematic dimensions of economic development research involving "cities." These results highlight the reciprocal relationship between research and context, showcasing the need for flexible scholarship methods fueled by interdisciplinary collaboration. This study helps build on urban economic development research by identifying notable contributors and the most receptive journal outlets and understanding longitudinal trends within specific subject areas of interest. It calls for continuous scholarly involvement, policy interventions supported by evidence-based research, and collaborative endeavors to address urban challenges in order to strive toward resilient city futures while ensuring inclusivity.</p><p>Although this bibliometric review offers valuable insights into the changing research constituency of economic development in cities, it is important to recognize that it is not without its limitations. However, the value of the insights it provides should not be understated.</p><p>Most importantly, the analysis is limited to information obtained solely from Scopus. Scopus is a widely used international database that archives numerous scholarly publications; however, it does not include all possible relevant papers (especially non-indexed journals and regional titles with specific approaches concerning context-based urban economic development).</p><p>Secondly, the bibliometric method utilized quantitative indicators such as counts of publications and citations and citation indices that highlight where research appears through mapping theorematic clusters. Although these metrics offer a systematic method to quantify scholarly output and thematic change over time, they may not capture critical qualitative dimensions (e.g., the degree of analysis or level of contextual consideration that informs interpretation). In addition, the interpretation of thematic clusters detected by VOSviewer sheds light on prevailing research topics. Clustering approaches are based entirely on keyword co-occurrence patterns, which may oversimplify complex interdisciplinary interactions or overlook nascent and positively valued emerging issues in the academic literature.</p><p>Third, geographic and institutional analyses are only as good as the information contained in Scopus regarding author affiliations. Differences in the formatting of author affiliations or errors made during data input mean less precise geographic and organizational attributions, which could mislead conclusions regarding global research contributions.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study is intended to enrich the literature on urban economic development by providing an in-depth analysis of research trends, scholarly publication dynamics, and conversational landscapes. Future research must adopt a more comprehensive approach to further its understanding of urban economic development and guide evidence-based policy interventions. This includes using pluralistic data sources and qualitative methodologies that complement bibliometric analyses and tackle other spelled-out challenges in interdisciplinary work.</p>
