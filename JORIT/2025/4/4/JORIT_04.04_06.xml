      <abstract><p>The trend of applying artificial intelligence (AI)-based personalization to e-commerce platforms is becoming increasingly popular to attract customers to buy products and services. To contribute to explaining this, this study was conducted to analyze the impact of artificial intelligence-based personalization on customers’ purchase intention when shopping on e-commerce platforms in Vietnam. Based on the PLS-SEM analysis method with valid data collected from 400 survey questionnaires for people who have shopped on e-commerce platforms. The results show that innovation, system quality, and information quality positively affect perceived usefulness and trust, thereby promoting purchase intentions. In addition, immersive experiences also positively affect purchase intentions. On that basis, the authors propose some management implications to help businesses operating on e-commerce platforms better understand the impact of AI-based personalization on purchase intentions, thereby being able to build strategies to improve operational efficiency and increase profits.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>According to a report from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">MarketingAI (2024)</xref>, despite the challenges facing the global economy, Vietnam’s e-commerce market still maintains significant growth. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Bain &amp;amp; Company (2023)</xref> recorded an 11% growth rate of Vietnam’s e-commerce in the period 2022–2023. The report also predicted that the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) will reach 22% and the industry’s total merchandise value could reach 24 billion USD by 2025. Along with that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Advertising Vietnam (2024)</xref>, the 2024 overview report on the online retail market and the 2025 forecast, the total revenue of the five major e-commerce platforms in Vietnam including Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop, Tiki, and Sendo reached about 318.9 trillion VND in 2024, an increase of 37.36% compared to 2023. This figure shows the rapid expansion and strong growth potential of e-commerce in the Vietnamese market in the coming period. In the context of increasingly fierce competition between e-commerce platforms in the Vietnamese market, enhancing customer experience personalization is becoming a leading strategy to create a competitive advantage. According to a survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Accenture (2024)</xref>, 91% of consumers said they tend to buy more from brands that provide personalized recommendations and offers. Also, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">McKinsey &amp;amp; Company (2024)</xref>, 78% of consumers tend to recommend brands that apply personalization, which encourages them to return to shop more often. The above figures show that personalization is not only a trend but also an important factor helping businesses grow sustainably and increase customer purchase intentions. More and more businesses are integrating AI into their operations to improve customer personalization experiences. In Vietnam, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">Statista (2025)</xref>, the AI market is expected to reach 1.3 billion USD by 2025, with great potential in e-commerce and digital marketing. A report by Bain &amp;amp; Company predicts that by 2025, about 80% of businesses in Vietnam will use AI to improve operational efficiency and enhance customer experience personalization. Platforms such as Tiki, Shopee, and Lazada have quickly applied AI to analyze user behavior and personalize experiences. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Accesstrade Vietnam (2025)</xref>, a report on Affiliate Marketing, Shopee is one of the typical businesses in strongly applying AI to deploy personalized product recommendation features. Thanks to that, the platform’s average revenue has grown by 15% in 2024, reflecting the positive impact of AI personalization on business results.</p><p>In addition, the impact of personalization on consumers, especially when supported by AI on e-commerce platforms, has become the focus of many international studies in recent years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Ballı (2024)</xref> asserted that AI-based product personalization has a positive impact on purchase intention, satisfaction, and brand loyalty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Yin et al. (2025)</xref> demonstrated that AI-based personalized product recommendations increase click-through intention through immersive experiences and technology acceptance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref> pointed out that personalized recommendation systems enhance trust and perceived usefulness, thereby increasing purchase intention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">El Alam &amp;amp; Bitar (2024)</xref> emphasized trust, usefulness, interactivity, and ease of use in driving purchase intention through personalized AI recommendations. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Pognonec &amp;amp; Bornard (2023)</xref> pointed out that AI contributes to improving purchase intention in the cosmetics industry due to convenience. In Vietnam, the number of studies on the impact of AI-based personalization on purchase intention is limited. Current studies mainly focus on the general role of personalization, without analyzing each component such as system quality, information quality or innovation as shown in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Chi &amp;amp; Anh (2024)</xref>. This gap makes it difficult for businesses to build a personalization strategy that suits the needs of Vietnamese consumers. Therefore, the research team: “AI-Powered Personalization and Purchase Intention on E-Commerce Platforms in Vietnam: An SOR-TAM Based Analysis” with the aim of clarifying the impact of AI-based personalization on purchase intentions, thereby proposing managerial implications to help businesses improve the effectiveness of personalization strategies and promote customers’ purchase intentions.</p>

            <title>2.1. Related theories</title>
          
          <p>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM): TAM is an important theoretical framework in analyzing the level of user acceptance of new technologies, especially in the field of e-commerce with AI applications. TAM focuses on analyzing technology acceptance behavior at the individual level, different from the UTAUT model commonly applied in organizational environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Rondán-Cataluña et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the authors apply the TAM model to explain how external factors such as innovation and information quality influence customers’ perceived usefulness, which in turn affects their purchase intention. The application of TAM not only helps to clarify the process of consumers accepting AI technology on e-commerce platforms, but also provides a solid scientific basis for evaluating the effectiveness of AI-based personalized recommendation systems in promoting shopping behavior.</p><p>Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theoretical model: The SOR model was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Mehrabian &amp;amp; Russell (1974)</xref>, based on environmental psychology. According to this model, external factors act as stimuli, creating certain cognitive or emotional responses within people, thereby influencing their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Jacoby, 2002</xref>). In the field of consumer behavior research, the SOR model has become the theoretical foundation for related studies on online shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, the authors apply the SOR model as a theoretical foundation to build and analyze the relationships in the proposed research model. Specifically, based on the SOR model, information quality and system quality are considered external stimuli, affecting internal psychological factors such as perceived usefulness, trust, and consumer immersion. These internal factors affect purchase intention, i.e. consumer behavioral response on e-commerce platforms.</p>

            <title>2.2. Related concepts</title>
          
          <p>AI</p><p>AI is a term coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, defined as the field of science and engineering aimed at developing intelligent thinking machines and computer programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Arslan, 2020</xref>). AI brings significant improvements, from personalizing product recommendations, optimizing real-time pricing, predicting consumer demand, improving smart search to improving supply chain and logistics efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Bawack et al., 2022</xref>). By harnessing the power of AI, businesses can analyze customer data more deeply, make quick decisions, and automate many important processes, leading to improved operational efficiency and a more engaging shopping experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Bawack et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Personalization</p><p>In marketing, personalization is understood as a customer-oriented strategy, aiming to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Dangi &amp;amp; Malik, 2017</xref>). The growing interest in personalization in the research community stems from the widespread use of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Montgomery &amp;amp; Smith, 2009</xref>) and the development of e-commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Dangi &amp;amp; Malik, 2017</xref>). However, personalization is not a new concept and has existed since the days of traditional commerce, when salespeople tailored their service based on each customer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">Vesanen, 2007</xref>). There are many different definitions of personalization. Some focus on the web experience, others emphasize tailoring products and services to customer behavior or creating value for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Montgomery &amp;amp; Smith, 2009</xref>). In this study, personalization is understood according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Imhoff et al. (2001)</xref> as the ability of a business to recognize customers as individuals and provide appropriate messages, offers, and products or services.</p><p>AI-Based Personalization in E-Commerce</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Gao &amp;amp; Liu (2022)</xref>’s study focuses on the role of AI in interactive marketing personalization, with elements such as customer profiling, behavioral instigation, and experience navigation to maintain engagement throughout the customer journey. AI is expected to have a strong impact on personalization in marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Paschen et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, AI-based personalization will be explored through recommender systems (RS), a technology that suggests products based on customers’ unique needs and preferences. RS are one of the most important and popular applications of personalization powered by artificial intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">Zanker et al., 2019</xref>). RS helps users easily access relevant products and content through suggestions based on personal preferences. The goal of recommender systems is to provide personalized products and services that more accurately meet customers’ needs and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Singh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Alhijawi et al. (2022)</xref>, three important indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of recommender systems include: system quality, information quality, and innovation. System quality is reflected in the accuracy and diversity of recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Panniello et al., 2016</xref>). In which, accuracy represents the degree of relevance to user preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Herlocker et al., 2004</xref>), while diversity reflects the differences between recommended products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Park &amp;amp; Han, 2013</xref>). Information quality is related to the persuasiveness and completeness of recommendation content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Mukherjee &amp;amp; Nath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yang, 2020</xref>). Persuasiveness is the extent to which the suggested content helps consumers feel confident and convinced to consider products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yang, 2020</xref>), while completeness reflects the extent to which the information provided is comprehensive and detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Mukherjee &amp;amp; Nath, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, innovativeness represents the ability of the system to provide novel suggestions that are different from the user’s previous experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Castells et al., 2021</xref>). Some studies have shown that although system quality, information quality, and innovativeness are not the only aspects of recommender systems, they are three fundamental factors that reflect the effectiveness of personalized recommender systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Castells et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>E-Commerce</p><p>E-commerce is the buying, selling, and exchanging of goods and services over the Internet, using digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, or personal computers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Faqih &amp;amp; Jaradat, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">García &amp;amp; Margallo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Jalilvand &amp;amp; Samiei, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">Tavera &amp;amp; Londoño, 2014</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Bloomenthal (2021)</xref>, this concept includes various forms such as retail, wholesale, dropshipping, crowdfunding, digital or physical product offerings, and subscription services... Due to its diversity and accessibility, e-commerce becomes attractive to consumers. In addition, e-commerce platforms not only benefit end users but also help businesses effectively exploit analytical tools to optimize business operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Tran, 2021</xref>). On the customer side, this form brings many benefits such as detailed product information, rich selection of categories, transparency between suppliers, and competitive prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Reinartz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Purchase Intention</p><p>Purchase intention is defined as the willingness to pay as well as the attitude and tendency of consumers towards purchasing a certain product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Bhagat et al., 2023</xref>). In e-commerce, purchase intention is a predictor of actual behavior, reflecting the link between behavioral intention and shopping behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). The stronger the consumer’s purchase intention, the more likely they are to make a decision to buy or use the product or service. Many factors influence purchase intention, including multichannel advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Lin, 2011</xref>), direct and online word-of-mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Jalilvand &amp;amp; Samiei, 2012</xref>), brand loyalty and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Büyükdağ, 2021</xref>), brand equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Senthilnathan &amp;amp; Tharmi, 2012</xref>), product attitudes, and social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ajzen, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Based on the S-O-R theoretical model and previous related studies on purchase intention, the author proposes a research model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

                <title>2.3.1 Innovation</title>
              
              <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Castells et al. (2021)</xref>, innovation is the extent to which a shopping experience differs from prior ones in order to pique interest and customize the encounter. Users would quickly become disinterested if AI merely makes product recommendations based on outdated practices without any innovation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Herlocker et al. (2004)</xref>, a recommendation system should not only be accurate but also focus on novelty, surprise and the ability to discover products that users have not been exposed to before. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">Zhang &amp;amp; Tao (2012)</xref> also asserted that innovativeness in recommendations plays a positive role in enhancing the perception of the system’s usefulness. In addition, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Knijnenburg et al. (2012)</xref>, when the recommender system suggests innovative products, it will not only satisfy the need for discovery but also make consumers perceive that the product recommendation system is really useful because it understands them. From there, the author proposes the hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis H1: Innovation has a positive impact on customers’ perceived usefulness when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p>

                <title>2.3.2 Information quality</title>
              
              <p>The relevance, correctness, completeness, timeliness, and usefulness of information in relation to its intended purpose are all measured by its quality. Good information saves time by assisting users in making precise and useful judgments. The degree to which consumers can use information to assess a product, brand, or company is known as information quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, customers can make more informed decisions about important aspects or attributes of a product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Chiu et al., 2005</xref>). Information quality is often divided into two main factors: persuasiveness and completeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Yang, 2020</xref>). In the context of personalized recommender systems, information quality becomes even more important in building users’ trust in product recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Cremonesi et al., 2012</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Yang (2021)</xref>, perceived information quality has a positive impact on trust in recommendations. From there, the author proposes the hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis H2: Information quality has a positive impact on customers’ perceived usefulness when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p><p>Hypothesis H3: Information quality has a positive impact on customers’ trust when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p>

                <title>2.3.3 System quality</title>
              
              <p>System quality relates to the reliability, accuracy, and completeness of the information collected and processed within the system, directly affecting the organization’s decisions and operational efficiency. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>, system quality is the extent to which a system can meet users’ expectations in terms of performance, reliability, and ability to provide content that is relevant to their needs. System quality is assessed based on two main factors: variety and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Panniello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Roudposhti et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Pu et al. (2011)</xref> showed that users’ perceptions of variety have a positive influence on their trust in the system and their behavioral intentions. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Panniello et al. (2016)</xref> also emphasized that the accuracy and diversity in context-based recommender systems have an impact on consumer trust, which in turn affects the number of products they purchase as well as their spending level. From there, the author proposes the hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis H4: System quality has a positive impact on customer trust when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p>

              <p>Immersion experience in online environments is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Hoffman &amp;amp; Novak (1996)</xref> as a state where the user is completely detached from the real world and completely focused on the activity being participated in. With the development of AI, the immersion experience in e-commerce is increasingly expanding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Yin et al. (2025)</xref> defined this as a state when consumers feel deeply present and fully focused on the process of interacting with a personalized recommendation system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Liao et al. (2023)</xref> pointed out that immersive experiences can affect purchase intentions, as consumers tend to spend more time learning about products, thereby increasing purchase intentions.

              <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Davis (1989)</xref> perceived usefulness is the extent to which users believe that using a particular system can improve their job performance. Customers’ opinions about the usefulness of recommender systems, especially when they perceive these systems to be accurate and efficient, significantly influence their purchase intentions. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Zhao &amp;amp; Wang (2020)</xref> also concluded that perceived usefulness has a positive impact on purchase intention. Overall, these findings highlight the important role of perceived usefulness in how AI-powered personalized recommendations can drive purchase intention. Therefore, the author proposes the following hypothesis:</p><p>Hypothesis H6: Perceived usefulness has a positive impact on customers’ purchase intention when shopping on e-commerce platforms.</p>

      <title>3. Research methodology</title>
      <p>Research method: The study uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, divided into 4 stages. In stage 1, the authors collected and analyzed documents to build a theoretical basis and propose a research model. In stage 2, the group conducted qualitative research, prepared a scale table and interviewed 10 experts. In stage 3, the group conducted preliminary quantitative research, collected data from 50 people to test the reliability of the scale with Cronbach’s Alpha. In stage 4, conducted official quantitative research with 400 valid survey forms, then used SPSS and SmartPLS software to analyze the data.</p><p>Research scales: The scales utilized are derived from scales from earlier research, with the phrasing modified to fit the research topic and environment. In particular, the five observed variables of the Innovation scale (SDM) were taken from the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Pognonec &amp;amp; Bornard (2023)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">Zhao et al. (2025)</xref>. Six observable factors are included in both the System Quality (CLHT) and Information Quality (CLTT) scales, which are derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>. Four observed variables for the Immersive Experience scale (TNDC) were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Yin et al. (2025)</xref>. The four observed factors that make up the Perceived Usefulness scale (SHI) were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Pognonec &amp;amp; Bornard (2023)</xref>. Three observed factors that were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">El Alam &amp;amp; Bitar (2024)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref> make up the Trust scale (LT). Finally, the Intention scale (YD) in Table A2 is made up of three observable variables that were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>.</p><p>Sample size and data collection method: According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Trong &amp;amp; Ngoc (2008)</xref>, the minimum sample size for factor analysis needs to be at least 5 times the number of observed variables. At the same time, according to the formula of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">Tabachnick &amp;amp; Ullman (2007)</xref>, with 4 independent variables, the minimum sample size in regression analysis is N = 8 * 4 + 50 = 82. However, to increase reliability and reduce errors in quantitative research, the authors decided to survey 470 consumers who have been shopping on e-commerce platforms in provinces and cities of Vietnam to ensure geographical balance. Of the 470 survey forms distributed, 456 responses were received; after eliminating 56 invalid forms, 400 valid forms remained for analysis.</p><p>Data analysis method: Using descriptive statistics method through SPSS 26 software to summarize and present basic demographic characteristics of the data set collected from the survey. In addition, using PLS-SEM analysis method through SmartPLS software to evaluate the measurement model and structural model. To evaluate the measurement model, the study used an external loading factor of 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Fong &amp;amp; Law, 2014</xref>), Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient greater than 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Fink &amp;amp; Litwin, 1995</xref>), AVE greater than 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Fong &amp;amp; Law, 2014</xref>), composite reliability (CR) greater than 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Hair Jr et al., 2017</xref>) and HTMT index less than 0.85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Henseler et al., 2015</xref>). Next, the study will evaluate the structural model based on the assessment of multicollinearity issues with VIF index less than 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Fong &amp;amp; Law, 2014</xref>) and the significance of the impact relationships in the model with <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">Vinzi et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

          <p>Among a total of 400 valid survey responses, there were 146 males (accounting for 36.5%) and 254 females (accounting for 63.5%). In terms of age, the group aged from 18 to under 25 years accounted for 67.3%, followed by the group aged from 25 to under 35 years at 15.5%, the group aged from 35 to under 45 years at 7.8%, those under 18 years at 6.3%, and those aged 45 years and above at 3.3%. Regarding occupation, students made up 57.8%, office workers represented 18.3%, other occupations (9.5%), school students (6.3%), civil service employees (5.5%), and entrepreneurs (2.8%). Meanwhile, 88.3% of the respondents possessed a higher level of education, and 11.8% had a lower level of education. In terms of living area, 53.5% of respondents currently live in urban areas, and 46.5% live in suburban areas. Considering shopping frequency, the group shopping 3–4 times a month accounted for the highest percentage at 64%, 17% shop 1–2 times a month, 10.8% shop 5–10 times a month, and 8.3% have other frequencies. In addition, the most common income ranges from 1 million to under 5 million VND, accounting for 54.3%, from 5 to under 10 million accounting for 26%, under 1 million VND accounting for 10.5%, and from 10 million and above accounting for 9.3%.</p>

            <title>4.2. Model measurement validation</title>
          
          <p>The scales’ convergent validity and reliability are used to assess the measurement model. The composite reliability (CR) is between 0.865 and 0.900, and the Cronbach’s Alpha (CA) coefficient is between 0.766 and 0.867. Since every value is above the 0.7 criterion, both indices show that the measurement scale achieves dependability. The average variance extracted (AVE) values, which range from 0.586 to 0.683, are all higher than the necessary threshold of 0.5. The minimal level is exceeded by all factor loading values, which range from 0.728 to 0.846 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Hair Jr et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, all 7 scales in this study achieve convergent validity as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>When comparing the research results of this study with previous studies, the authors found a clear similarity. Specifically, the factors proposed by the group in the model all have a positive impact on purchase intention. Hypothesis H1 suggests that “Innovation” positively affects “Perceived Usefulness”, and the test results accepted this hypothesis with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.134, which is similar to the previous research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Pognonec &amp;amp; Bornard (2023)</xref>. However, the impact level of “Innovation” on consumers’ “Perceived Usefulness” in this group’s research is lower than in the previous study, with a coefficient <italic>β</italic> = 0.362, which may be due to differences in the research subjects or the specific research context, such as products, industries, or business areas that are characterized by personal experience, consumer needs, and frequently changing market trends etc. Hypotheses H2 and H3 indicate that “Information Quality” positively affects both “Perceived Usefulness” and “Trust”, with standardized regression coefficients of 0.409 and 0.411, respectively. These results are consistent with the research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>. However, unlike the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>, which surveyed a group of consumers using various online shopping platforms in South Korea, the authors carried out their survey on users of e-commerce platforms in Vietnam, aiming to further analyze the behavior and factors influencing specific purchase intentions. Hypothesis H4 shows that “System Quality” positively affects “Trust”, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.211. This research result is also consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>. Hypothesis H5 suggests that “Immersive Experience” has a positive impact on “Purchase Intention”, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.322, similar to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Yin et al. (2025)</xref>.</p><p>However, the notable difference is that in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Yin et al. (2025)</xref>, the factor of “Immersive Experience” was identified as a mediating variable, serving as a bridge between “Personalized Experiences” and “Purchase Intention”. Unlike previous research, the new findings in this study have broadened the perspective by demonstrating that “Immersive Experience” is not only a mediating variable but also directly influences “Purchase Intention”. Hypothesis H6 indicates that “Perceived Usefulness” positively affects “Purchase Intention”, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.292. The results of this study are consistent with the research results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">El Alam &amp;amp; Bitar (2024)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Pognonec &amp;amp; Bornard (2023)</xref>. This further reinforces the view that “Perceived Usefulness” is an important factor in forming “Purchase Intention” in the e-commerce environment. Hypothesis H7 shows that “Trust” has a positive impact on “Purchase Intention”, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.357. This finding is also entirely consistent with the research results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Lu &amp;amp; Kim (2023)</xref>, as both studies emphasize the importance of trust in driving purchase intentions in the e-commerce environment.</p>

            <title>5.1. Conclusion</title>
          
          <p>Through the application of the SOR model, the study has obtained significant results with high practical value. Specifically, the group of authors has identified the core factors of AI-based personalization that affect purchase intention and measured the impact level of each factor in the context of consumers shopping on e-commerce platforms. The results show that three main factors affect purchase intentions: trust, immersive experience, and perceived usefulness. Among them, trust plays a dominant role, reflecting consumers’ confidence in personalized products as a key factor driving shopping behavior. The immersive experience helps enhance emotional attachment to the platform, while perceived usefulness reflects the extent to which personalized products meet users’ real needs.</p><p>In addition, while system quality and innovation also have an impact, albeit to a lesser degree, individualized characteristics like information quality are found to be important determinants in fostering trust and improving sense of utility. Additionally, the study highlights how trust and utility perception play a mediating role in converting individualized factors into purchase intention. The study has made substantial contributions to the scientific understanding and practical implementation of AI-based personalization for e-commerce platforms. Based on these findings, the research has suggested management implications to improve platform operational efficiency, improve user experience quality, and thereby increase customers’ purchase intention when shopping on e-commerce platforms. From a scientific perspective, the research contributes to the refinement of the theoretical basis regarding the impact of AI in e-commerce, while also expanding the SOR model of Lu &amp;amp; Kim by integrating the factor of “Innovation” and harnessing “Immersive Experience” as an independent variable. These additions make the theoretical model more comprehensive while also opening up a new perspective on how consumers react to personalized proposals. From a practical standpoint, the research provides important foundations to help e-commerce businesses better understand the factors driving customers’ purchasing intentions, thereby enabling them to develop effective personalization strategies, enhance user experiences, and increase competitiveness in the market.</p>

                <title>5.2.1 Regarding information quality</title>
              
              <p>Research shows that “Information Quality” has the strongest impact on trust and the perceived usefulness of personalized recommendations on e-commerce platforms, with standardized regression coefficients of 0.411 and 0.409, respectively. The observed variables related to information quality have average values ranging from 3.19 to 3.29, indicating a neutral assessment from customers. Platforms can use AI to create automated content moderation systems to enhance the quality of information by swiftly identifying mistakes like typos, inadequate descriptions, or improper photos. This will automatically filter and restrict the presentation of inferior products. Improve machine learning algorithms to gather, process, and evaluate search history, customer feedback, and shopping behavior data to produce thorough suggestions that cater to each customer’s needs. In addition, making the AI-based recommendation mechanism transparent by implementing simple explanation features for the reasons behind recommendations, such as “You viewed product A, so you might like product B”, to increase trust and customer satisfaction with the system. Moreover, natural language processing (NLP) technology can be used by platforms to automatically create or modify product descriptions, guaranteeing clients clear, thorough, SEO-friendly, and easily comprehensible information.</p>

                <title>5.2.2 Regarding system quality</title>
              
              <p>The factor “System Quality” has a positive impact on users’ “Trust”, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.211. Users rated the quality of the system quite evenly, with an average value ranging from 3.26 to 3.38. To improve system quality, it is necessary to focus on enhancing the accuracy of the product recommendation system. Specifically, AI can be applied to conduct deeper semantic analysis when users search using text, helping to correctly understand the intent and context of the queries, thereby providing more accurate recommendations. With image search, the computer vision system can identify detailed characteristics of products such as style, color, material, etc., and compare them with available product data to suggest similar options. In addition, the integration of voice recognition technology will make it easier for users to search, especially on mobile devices, while AI will learn to interpret diverse voice commands to provide appropriate suggestions. To expand diversity, AI can be leveraged to recommend complementary or alternative products from different categories and brands, while still being relevant to the user’s needs, thereby stimulating exploration and increasing order value. At the same time, a reinforcement learning system should be implemented so that the recommendation system continuously learns from user responses, self-adjusting its model to provide increasingly accurate suggestions.</p>

                <title>5.2.3 Regarding innovation</title>
              
              <p>The factor “Innovation” plays an important role in shaping perceptions of the usefulness of personalized recommendations for users on e-commerce platforms. Specifically, the standardized regression coefficient of 0.134 indicates a significant influence of this factor. E-commerce platforms need to enhance the personalized experience by analyzing users’ current shopping behavior to identify gaps, that is, products that they have never searched for or purchased but may be interested in. In addition, it is necessary to implement highly exploratory suggestion functions, such as random recommendations based on personal preferences (color, price range, style, etc.), which will help users not to be limited to familiar products but have the opportunity to access new and unique items, stimulating interest and unexpected consumption behavior. There should be a focus on integrating community power into the product suggestion system. Instead of personalizing solely based on individual user data, the system should analyze behavior, trends, and evaluations from user groups with similar characteristics. For example, displaying suggestions like “Top favorite products in the tech lover’s community”, or “Suggestions from users with similar consumption habits to yours”. This helps increase trust in product choices while supporting users in discovering products they have never thought of but that are very suitable.</p>

                <title>5.2.4 Regarding trust</title>
              
              <p>The factor “Trust” has the strongest influence on purchase intention, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.357. To enhance trust, it is necessary to ensure that the proposed products are not only suitable but also of high quality. E-commerce platforms should integrate the feature of “hiding product suggestions” so that users can proactively eliminate irrelevant recommendations, thus feeling respected and in control of the displayed content. Data from the behavior of “hiding products” also serves as an indirect source of feedback, helping the AI system adjust its algorithms to make recommendations more accurate and relevant. In addition, blockchain technology is used to verify the origin and quality of products. Each product will be assigned a unique verification code, allowing consumers to trace all information related to the production, distribution, and certification processes of the product. Notifications such as “Product has been verified” will be prominently displayed on the product page, providing maximum reassurance to customers. The combination of AI and blockchain will create a transparent and reliable ecosystem, where AI is responsible for analyzing, learning consumer behavior, and providing personalized recommendations, while blockchain ensures the authenticity of the product and related data.</p>

                <title>5.2.5 Regarding immersive experience</title>
              
              <p>Research results indicate that the immersive experience is the second strongest factor influencing customers’ purchase intention on e-commerce platforms, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.332. Optimizing page load speed and interface smoothness should be a top priority for e-commerce platforms, particularly when consumers are switching between products or categories. Users will be able to stay focused and spend more time interacting with product recommendations if the experience is smooth and uninterrupted. Additionally, by using AI to recall past actions and browsing history, an immersive experience must be developed as a habit of repeated attachment. To arouse users’ emotional recollections, the platform might offer recommendations like “continue exploring from last time” or “you liked this product.” Because of this, they return to a state of immersion in a matter of seconds after gaining access, which is essential in the current competitive environment. AI should be applied to recognize and adapt to users’ moods, thereby personalizing recommendations not only based on behavioral profiles but also on current emotions. By offering simple emotional choices (“How do you feel today?”), the system can automatically adjust the type of suggested products, for example, essential oils and books if the user wants to relax, or colorful fashion accessories if they are feeling happy, which will help upgrade the experience from “appropriate” to “empathetic”.</p>

                <title>5.2.6 Regarding perceived usefulness</title>
              
              <p>The research results indicate that perceived usefulness is the third most significant factor influencing users’ purchase intentions on e-commerce platforms, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.292. To enhance users’ perception of usefulness, the application of AI in recommendation systems plays a key role. AI can collect and analyze user behavior data from various sources such as Shopee Live, Shopee Video, search queries, interaction time with products, etc., in order to provide increasingly precise personalized recommendations. The AI system can also automatically identify related products or those with similar consumption trends, helping users access more suitable choices without wasting time on manual searches. At the same time, it should integrate a smart comparison feature between equivalent products right within the suggestions, thanks to AI analyzing the prominent differences in price, features, and user reviews. These recommendations will help shorten the shopping journey. These applications not only enhance the perception of the system’s usefulness but also contribute to improving conversion rates and sustaining user retention.</p>

            <title>6.1. Research limitations</title>
          
          <p>Firstly, during the implementation process, the research team encountered some difficulties in accessing experts due to limited time for discussions and busy work schedules. In addition, since the research topic is still relatively new in Vietnam, domestic reference materials are limited, making it difficult to find theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, most of the reference materials are from foreign sources, which affects the accuracy and completeness of accessing specialized content. </p><p>Secondly, although 400 valid survey responses were collected, this number is still not large enough to represent the entire customer base using e-commerce platforms in Vietnam. Therefore, the research results are only for reference for a portion of consumers and cannot fully reflect the impact of AI-based personalization on user purchasing behavior on this platform.</p><p>Although the study has certain limitations, it still meets the set objectives and brings some new insights in terms of theoretical models as well as methodological approaches. In particular, in the context of Vietnam, there is still limited in-depth research on the impact of personalization on e-commerce platforms. This study contributes to opening up potential research directions for the future, while also providing practical foundations and proposing appropriate managerial implications to promote consumer purchase intentions on e-commerce platforms.</p>

            <title>6.2. Future research directions</title>
          
          <p>Firstly, future studies should use greater sample sizes to broaden the scope of surveys. This will more accurately depict how much AI-based personalization affects consumers’ intents to make purchases on e-commerce sites in the actual setting of different Vietnamese groups. Furthermore, conducting surveys over an extended period of time will aid in assessing shifts in consumer behavior.</p><p>Secondly, the sample size was nevertheless constrained even though the study integrated both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to obtain deeper insights into customer perceptions and experiences using AI-powered personalization features. To improve the validity and generalizability of the research findings, future studies could use a larger sample size for focus groups or in-depth interviews as well as more varied sampling techniques.</p><p>Thirdly, the effect of personalization on consumers’ perceptions of privacy and acceptance of technology is a crucial research area that must be taken into account. Customers may get concerned about being overly monitored in the context of e-commerce platforms, which are gathering more and more personal data to improve the shopping experience. This could have a detrimental impact on their intents to make purchases. Future studies could therefore evaluate the degree of privacy concerns and the readiness to embrace new technologies like AI-powered customization.</p>
