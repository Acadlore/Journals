      <abstract><p>Damage to asphalt roads is frequently caused by waterlogging and overloading. While asphalt pavement remains an economical choice, Indonesia imports 75% of its supply, coinciding with a growing crisis of low-value plastic waste e.g., Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polystyrene (PS), and Polypropylene (PP) that is economically challenging to sort and recycle. This study proposes a novel solution by utilizing a blended mixture of these plastics (40% LDPE, 30% PP, 30% PS) to simulate unsorted waste streams for modifying Asphalt Concrete-Wearing Course (AC-WC) pavement. The dry mixing process was employed to substitute asphalt at dosages of 0%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% by weight. The research methodology encompassed material characterization, aggregate gradation design, and Marshall testing to determine the Optimum Asphalt Content (OAC) and Optimum Plastic Content (OPC). The durability of the optimal mix was subsequently rigorously assessed through prolonged water immersion at 60 $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for durations of 30 minutes, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Results indicated that a 10% plastic substitution at an OAC of 6.3% yielded the highest Marshall stability, with all volumetric parameters within specified tolerance limits. The mixture exhibited exceptional resistance to moisture damage, evidenced by an Index of Retained Stability (IRS) of 94.64% after 24 hours, surpassing the 90% requirement. Furthermore, the Retained Marshall Stability was 87.40% after 96 hours. Additional durability metrics, including the First Durability Index (FDI) and Second Durability Index (SDI), were analyzed to comprehensively evaluate the performance degradation over time. The findings conclusively demonstrate that modifying asphalt with this blended, unsorted plastic composition is not only feasible but also enhances mechanical properties and durability, offering a viable and sustainable strategy for large-scale plastic waste management in infrastructure development.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The quality of materials and technical standards in implementation will affect the quality of asphalt mixtures. The government, through the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing, has established requirements for the quality of materials and the technical standards of asphalt mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Low material quality and substandard implementation are factors causing road damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Other factors include road overloading and climatic conditions such as high rainfall, which often causes puddles on the road surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. When the bond between asphalt and aggregate loosens due to submersion in water and the passage of heavy vehicles, it will damage the road surface bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Flexible pavement remains the more economical choice to date, while 75% of the asphalt needed to meet domestic demand is still imported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, plastic waste problems in Indonesia have become a public concern. Based on population density within 50 km of the coastline, waste management systems, and economic status, Indonesia ranks second in the world after China in terms of plastic waste pollution in the sea, at around 0.48–1.29 million tons/year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. A study notes that 20% of plastic debris in the sea comes from sea-based sources, such as fishing vessels, and 80% from land-based sources, of which 75% comes from uncollected waste and 25% from formal urban waste management systems. Recycling efforts alone are insufficient to reduce plastic waste leakage into the oceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]; only 18% of plastics are valuable enough to be recycled, such as PET and HDPE types, while 82% are of medium and low value, such as Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polystyrene (PS), and Polypropylene (PP) types. Plastics with medium and low values are more likely to end up in the ocean. The problem of accumulating low-value plastic waste continues to increase every year, and this plastic waste is difficult to decompose in nature, taking hundreds of years. Plastic waste pollution in the sea is a global challenge, and the solution requires action at the local level.</p><p>LDPE, PP, and PS plastics have thermal properties; when heated, they soften at an average temperature between 100–160 <inline-formula>

Methods of adding plastic waste to asphalt mixtures include the wet process, which involves mixing plastic waste with hot asphalt and stirring homogeneously, and the dry process, which involves mixing plastic waste with preheated aggregate and then adding hot asphalt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].

When asphalt is mixed with aggregate coated with plastic, some of the asphalt diffuses through the plastic layer and binds to the aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>Various modifications to meet the desired criteria for road pavement layer mixtures by utilising plastic waste continue to be carried out by researchers. LDPE plastic types include plastic bags and ice cube plastics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], PP plastic types include instant noodle wrappers, instant coffee powder packaging, and instant snack packaging, and PS plastic types include Styrofoam food containers and disposable Styrofoam drink containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. In practice, separating these plastic wastes during processing is difficult when only one type is used, such as LDPE, PP, or PS, in large-scale pavement mixtures.</p><p>Given the problems mentioned above and the potential of plastic waste, it is technically feasible to conduct research to modify Laston mixtures by substituting low-value plastic waste. This research investigates the performance of AC-WC Laston Mixtures substituted with a combination of LDPE, PP, and PS Plastic Waste using the dry method of mixing plastic waste into the Laston mixture. This study addresses a research gap: most prior work has tested single polymer types (LDPE, PP, or PS), whereas this study investigates unsorted mixed plastics to reflect real-world waste streams. This novelty supports practical scalability and complements recent literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>The difference from previous research is that this research combines three plastic wastes into a single mixture with a composition of 40% LDPE, 30% PP, and 30% PS to replace the Laston mixture.</p><p>Moreover, this investigation aims to determine the effect of water immersion on plastic waste-modified Laston mixtures (AC-WC) at the selected optimum plastic content (OPC), with immersion times of 30 minutes, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours.</p>

          <p>The chosen composition ratio of 40% LDPE, 30% PP, and 30% PS reflects the typical proportions of unsorted low-value plastic waste in Indonesia. While the dry process was selected for its practicality in asphalt plants, it is acknowledged that it may result in lower homogeneity than the wet process. The use of three specimens per test is consistent with Marshall standards, but future research should increase the sample size ($n$ <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> 5) to allow for statistical validation.</p><p>The dry mixing method was selected for this investigation due to its practical advantages for potential large-scale applications and its effectiveness in coating aggregates with plastic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. This method is simpler to implement in conventional asphalt plants as it does not require significant modification to the machinery; the plastic waste can be added directly to the mixer alongside the heated aggregates. The technical rationale is that the preheated aggregate (155–160 <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>) provides the thermal energy to melt and coat the plastic onto the stone surface, creating a thin polymeric film that can potentially enhance the bond between the aggregate and the bitumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. It is acknowledged that a limitation of the dry process is the potential for incomplete plastic homogenization within the mixture compared to the wet process. Furthermore, a sample size of three specimens per test condition was used, which is consistent with standard Marshall mix design procedures (e.g., ASTM D6927) but limits the ability to perform robust statistical analysis. Future studies should use a larger sample size (e.g., $n$ <inline-formula>

          <p>The results demonstrate that a blend of mixed plastics (LDPE, PP, PS) can effectively enhance Marshall stability, achieving optimal performance at a 10% substitution rate. This is a significant finding as it proves that meticulous sorting into pure polymer types is not a prerequisite for performance gains, validating the practical approach of using commingled plastic waste. The highest stability value is achieved at a plastic content of 10%, although the flow value tends to increase when the plastic content exceeds 10%. The combination of polymers appears to create a synergistic effect that improves the structural properties of the mix, validating the practical approach of using commingled plastic waste. Using plastic in the AC-WC pavement mixture with an OAC of 6.3% shows that the Marshall values meet the standards for modified asphalt mixtures. The highest stability value is achieved at a plastic content of 10%, although the flow value tends to increase when the plastic content exceeds 10%. While the parameters mostly fall within standards, instances in which VMA values slightly exceed the limits highlight potential sensitivity to plastic dosage. Statistical testing (e.g., ANOVA) was not performed and represents a limitation of this study. Nonetheless, the overall performance trend supports the practical applicability of mixed plastic waste. The highest stability value is achieved at a plastic content of 10%, although the flow value tends to increase when the plastic content exceeds 10%.</p><p>The combination of polymers appears to create a synergistic effect that improves the structural properties of the mix, validating the practical approach of using commingled plastic waste.

            <title>3.6. Durability testing results</title>
          
          <p>The test results for the AC-WC mixture with plastic waste showed an OPC of 10%. This OPC value is used as the reference for creating test specimens for further testing. In practical terms, the First Durability Index (FDI) reflects the rate of strength loss under immersion, while the Second Durability Index (SDI) indicates the total loss of strength. These indices suggest that the plastic-modified mix resists water damage better than conventional asphalt, supporting its potential for field application.</p><p>Durability testing is essential to assess asphalt’s resistance to ageing, weather conditions, and traffic loads. It ensures long-term performance by evaluating oxidation, moisture damage, and temperature fluctuations.</p><p>The test results indicate that the Index of Retained Stability (IRS), which measures the ability of an asphalt mixture to maintain stability after being immersed in water, gradually decreases as the immersion duration increases. This decline is expected, as prolonged exposure to water typically weakens asphalt mixtures. However, despite the reduced IRS values, they remain above the minimum threshold of 90% specified by the Bina Marga 2018 General Specifications, Division 6, which serves as Indonesia’s road construction standard.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, at 24 hours of immersion, the IRS value is 94.64 per cent, indicating that the mixture retains most of its original stability.</p>

After 48 hours of immersion, the IRS value decreases slightly to 91.04 per cent, which is still above the minimum requirement.

The value of the SDI is 12.6%, representing a total loss of strength of 12.6%.</p><p>The SDI value indicates a 12.6% loss in strength after 96 hours of immersion. This means that the asphalt mixture retained 87.4% of its original strength after prolonged exposure to water.</p><p>The AC-WC plastics mixture loses some strength due to water exposure. However, it still retains a significant portion of its stability, indicating a relatively good level of water resistance and durability. However, if the SDI value were much higher (e.g., 30% or more), it would indicate poor moisture resistance, leading to concerns about long-term pavement performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>The FDI is 0.731%, indicating that the asphalt mix loses 0.731% of its strength per hour (or per day) on average during the immersion period. Meanwhile, the SDI is 12.6%, indicating that the mixture lost 12.6% of its total strength after 96 hours of immersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>The durability of the mixture can be attributed to the substitution of asphalt with plastic waste, specifically LDPE, PP, and PS, which alters the mixture’s characteristics. Plastic-modified asphalt exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature changes, which affects its interaction with water. Despite this sensitivity, the plastic modification plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall strength of the asphalt mixture, making it more resistant to water-induced damage than conventional asphalt mixtures.</p><p>The strong durability indices (IRS, FDI, SDI) observed, even with a mixed plastic composition, further support the viability of this approach. The mixture's resistance to water damage indicates that the composite plastic coating remains effective despite the use of different polymers, addressing a potential concern regarding the compatibility of LDPE, PP, and PS in a single matrix. This enhances the potential for real-world applications where plastic waste is inherently mixed.</p>

      <title>4. Environmental and practical implications</title>
      <p>Modifying asphalt pavements with mixed plastic waste offers significant environmental and potential economic advantages. From an environmental perspective, this research provides a direct pathway to diverting low-value, commingled LDPE, PP, and PS waste from landfills and oceans, aligning with global efforts to promote a circular economy. Utilising this waste stream in asphalt, a high-volume infrastructure material, offers a scalable recycling solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p>From a practical and economic standpoint, the dry process method was intentionally selected for its scalability. The feasibility of integrating this mixed plastic blend into existing asphalt plant operations without major capital investment is high, as it primarily involves adding a feeder for the plastic shreds into the aggregate mixer. A preliminary qualitative cost analysis indicates that reduced costs can be achieved through waste disposal avoidance, such as savings on landfill fees, as well as potential long-term benefits from the extended service life of pavements due to improved durability. In addition, substituting 10% of the asphalt, a relatively expensive binder, with cheaper plastic waste could yield direct material cost savings, depending on local asphalt prices and the costs of collecting and processing the plastic waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p><p>However, these advantages need to be weighed against processing costs, which include collection, sorting to eliminate non-plastic contaminants and undesirable plastics like PVC, shredding, and storage of the plastic waste. While a detailed life-cycle cost analysis is beyond the scope of this study, the initial technical results are promising. The main practical challenge for real-world application would be establishing a reliable supply chain for collecting and pre-processing the plastic waste to a consistent size and quality. Future work must therefore focus on addressing these logistical challenges and conducting full-scale field trials to validate both the long-term performance and the economic viability of pavements constructed with mixed plastic waste.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Based on the findings of this study, several conclusions can be drawn. The results indicate that increasing the percentage of plastic waste substitution, incorporating a collaborative blend of LDPE, PP, and PS into the AC-WC asphalt mixture, improves Marshall stability values. However, this study is limited to laboratory-scale tests with relatively small sample sizes. Future work should include full-scale field trials, life-cycle cost and environmental impact analyses, and statistical validation using larger datasets. The results hold important implications for sustainable road construction policy and large-scale plastic waste management.</p><p>At an OAC of 6.3%, the addition of 10% LDPE, PP, and PS yielded the highest stability value while ensuring that key Marshall parameters, including Marshall Quotient, VIM, VFB, and VMA, remained within acceptable tolerance limits.</p><p>The optimal plastic content was determined to be 10% of the total asphalt weight. This composition resulted in an IRS of 94.64% after 24 hours of immersion, surpassing the 90% threshold required by Bina Marga standards. Furthermore, the absolute RMS was 87.40% after 96 hours of immersion, demonstrating enhanced durability and resistance of the modified asphalt mixture.</p><p>This study demonstrates that a collaborative blend of unsorted, low-value plastics (40% LDPE, 30% PP, 30% PS) can effectively enhance the performance and durability of AC-WC asphalt mixtures. This approach directly addresses a key knowledge gap between laboratory studies of single-polymer modifications and the practical realities of mixed plastic waste streams.</p><p>This study has demonstrated that a mixed blend of LDPE, PP, and PS plastic waste can be successfully incorporated into AC-WC asphalt mixtures using the practical dry process method, enhancing Marshall stability and durability. Beyond its technical performance, this approach offers a promising, scalable waste management solution with positive environmental implications. Even after prolonged exposure to water, the mixture continues to meet the Bina Marga standard, providing strong evidence that using plastic waste in asphalt mixtures can enhance road pavement performance.</p>
