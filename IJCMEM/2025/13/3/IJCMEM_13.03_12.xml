      <abstract><p>This paper presents simulation and experimental validation of a Nonlinear Compensation-based Neuro-Fuzzy (NCNF) controller designed to balance the rotary inverted pendulum (RIP). Traditional linear controllers, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and state-feedback with pole placement, usually achieve satisfactory results in simulations on linearized models. However, their performance decreases in hardware implementation because of disturbances and unmodeled nonlinear effects such as Coulomb friction and mechanical backlash. To overcome these challenges, a feedforward compensation function was developed to cancel these undesired effects, which is combined with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) controller that updates PID gains to improve the rotary arm tracking for a square-wave reference and stabilize the pendulum at the upright position. The proposed NCNF controller is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments and compared with a baseline state-feedback controller. Results show that the arm angle ($\theta$) overshoot decreased from 40.6% to 0.8% (lower step) and from 17.2% to 2.5% (upper), total steady-state $\theta$-error from 5.75° to 0.296°, and the fitness index dropped from 41.12 to 25.23. The nonlinear compensation reduced the gap between simulation and real-time performance, while the ANFIS further improved the defined control metrics. Overall, the NCNF controller achieves more stable and precise tracking than the state-feedback control.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Rotary Inverted Pendulum (RIP) is a nonlinear and underactuated system commonly used in research to evaluate different types of controllers. The system has fourth-order dynamics and unstable in open-loop. For this reason, it is often chosen as a model to reflect the complexity of real-world applications. Examples are found in robotics, transport systems such as Segways, and cranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The control problem of the RIP is demanding because it needs methods that can keep the pendulum upright and, at the same time, ensure the rotary arm follows the desired reference angle with accuracy in real-time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Classical linear controllers such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and state-feedback techniques have been widely applied to the RIP system because they are simple and give acceptable performance on linearized models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. However, their fixed-gain nature makes them sensitive to nonlinear hardware effects and measurement noise. In practice, problems such as motor dead-zone, Coulomb friction, and backlash appear in hardware, together with errors in derivative estimation. These limitations usually cause unstable closed-loop behavior, poor tracking with oscillations, or delays in response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>To deal with these issues, many control methods have been proposed. They range from robust and nonlinear controllers to adaptive and fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy approaches. Robust methods such as H-infinity control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] and generalized dynamic inversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] have been used to keep the RIP stable under uncertainties and disturbances. However, their heavy mathematical design makes them hard to apply in real-time. Nonlinear controllers have also been used. Lyapunov-based methods hold stability close to equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Sliding mode control rejects disturbances well but it causes chattering effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Adaptive control can adjust the parameters to address uncertainties. However, it needs more computational cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. These control methods often perform better than simple linear controllers. yet, their complexity and practical constraints limit them from being widely used.</p><p>Adaptive control with intelligent algorithms such as fuzzy logic and neuro-fuzzy methods has become more common for dealing with nonlinear and uncertain dynamics. Fuzzy controllers work on a rule-based structure, while extensions such as fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) make transitions smoother and more stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Fuzzy observer-based control with Takagi-Sugeno models present a more organized way for the integration of fuzzy logic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Results show that fuzzy logic control performs better than traditional methods in terms of stability and response time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Intelligent controllers that include neural networks make the design more adaptable, and with neuro-fuzzy systems, adding the learning feature to help better the performance over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Even with these improvements, such techniques need much more tuning for the parameters and powerful computational resources, and they are rarely tested experimentally in combination with nonlinear compensation functions.</p><p>The RIP dynamics are already nonlinear due to the equations of motion, such as the sine, cosine terms and the coupling between the pendulum and the rotary arm. In practice, the hardware also introduces extra nonlinear effects like dead-zone, backlash, and friction. Few studies developed direct compensation for these hardware effects, where unmodeled nonlinearities are seen as a challenge for a robust design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. However, they are usually treated as an obstacle rather than the main target of compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. There has been some progress. For example, authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] suggested a modified signal compensation method for balance control. However, it does not directly address dead-zones or backlash. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] studied friction estimation but did not fully integrate it with the adaptive RIP control scheme. Thus, complete approaches that handle hardware nonlinearities are still limited. Recent studies narrow this gap by using intelligent control on RIP systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Hybrid fuzzy-SMC and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based fuzzy adaptive SMC were tested with hardware-in-the-loo (HIL) to handle disturbances and delays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. Another work focuses on the compensation itself for mechanical backlash with an inverted pendulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] and RL-based friction compensation on a cart–pendulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. These results support adding explicit nonlinear compensation. However, few papers combine compensation with a neuro-fuzzy controller and then validate the approach in HIL experiments. For example, a 2025 ANFIS-LQR study on a double-linked rotary pendulum reports improved tracking and disturbance rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we introduce a Nonlinear Compensation-based Neuro-Fuzzy (NCNF) controller for the Quanser Rotary Inverted Pendulum system and compare it to a state-feedback baseline control designed using the pole placement method. The conceptual contribution is a hardware-aware control architecture that integrates real-time feedforward compensation with an ANFIS-tuned PID in one controller. The goal is to handle unmodeled hardware effects, such as Coulomb friction, backlash, and dead-zone. Unlike standard ANFIS-PID and sliding-mode controllers that treat these nonlinearities as external disturbances, our method cancels them in real-time using a feedforward correction. This makes the NCNF controller adaptive to adjust the compensation and reduce the gap between simulation and experiments. The proposed control architecture showed stable system performance with reduced overshoot and improved desired tracking under changing square-wave reference signal.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the linearized model of the RIP system, obtained from the nonlinear equations. Section 3 describes the methodology, including the state-feedback with pole placement, nonlinear compensation, and the ANFIS-PID design. Section 4 shows the simulation and experimental (HIL) results with performance comparisons using different metrics. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the main findings in this work with future directions.</p>

The servo base is moved by a Faulhaber 2338S DC motor that turns the arm and sets the pendulum in motion. A power amplifier and data acquisition unit are necessary to control and track the system’s movement. The system is also equipped with two optical encoders, each with a high resolution of 4096 counts per revolution to measure the angles of rotary arm and pendulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>].</p>

          <p>Although the state-feedback controller gives acceptable performance in simulation, real-time experiments showed clear degradation because of unmodeled nonlinearities such as motor dead-zone, mechanical backlash, and asymmetric Coulomb friction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. These effects are not part of the RIP mathematical model but come from the hardware. That is why we designed a nonlinear compensation block as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> to handle these effects by:</p>

              <p>The dead zone characteristic of the power amplifier can be modeled by a piecewise function, as shown in Eq. (17). This nonlinearity causes small control voltages to fail reach the motor. As a result, these inputs are insufficient to generate motion leading to steady-state error and small oscillations when tracking the desired system states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>].</p>

</inline-formula>) accounts for the amplifier’s saturation limits. These nonlinearity effects add a constant torque bias and clip the voltage during large transients, which reduces control authority and slows the response. While Eq. (21) shows how friction enters the system, it cannot be cancelled directly in real-time. Instead, its effect was reduced with smoothing hyperbolic tangent velocity function. This was combined with a low-pass filter and a saturation stage to keep the signal within the amplifier limits:</p>

            <title>3.3. Design of the anfis-pid controller</title>
          
          <p>The fixed-gain of state-feedback controller provides a useful baseline, but could not adapt to unmodeled nonlinearities or disturbances. To further improve robustness and adaptability, we built an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based PID controller with the integrated nonlinear compensation block (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar compensatory neuro-fuzzy approaches have been successfully applied to inverted pendulum systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. Our hybrid controller, called NCNF, combines the rule-base structure of fuzzy logic with the learning ability of neural networks, and the robustness of PID control. The equation that defines the ANFIS-PID control law for the rotary arm is given by Eq. (24) while for the pendulum in Eq. (25):</p>

One controlled the arm angle to track the square-wave reference, while the other stabilized the pendulum angle at the upright position. Because the rotary arm angle follows a challenging reference signal with sudden changes (discontinuous), an integrator action was later added to the <inline-formula>

This dataset is sufficent for training the ANFIS controller since it includes several reference trajectories like step signal and square-waves with different amplitudes.</p><p>The state-feedback controller worked quite well in simulation as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, with corresponding performance metrics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. However, tracking accuracy dropped in real-time performance because of unmodeled nonlinearities such as motor dead-zone, backlash, and asymmetric Coulomb friction. These effects are present only in the real hardware system and not in the simulation model, which explains the gap between the two results.</p>

This asymmetry indicates a direction-dependent torque bias on the rotary base and which agrees with the previous reports of asymmetric friction and backlash effects in servo-driven systems, including the Quanser SRV02 and QUBE families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. These undesired effects increase tracking errors. For example, fitness function ($F<inline-formula>

          <p>To correct for hardware nonlinearities that decrease performance near the upright equilibrium, a natural idea would be to first model the nonlinear behaviors not considered in simulation to better represent the real-world RIP system. After that, a second step would be to design a compensation function to address these modeled nonlinearities in simulation and thus test its effectiveness in real hardware system. By following this approach, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>, shows the results after adding the unmodelled nonlinear dynamics to the RIP in simulation (step 1) and with the applied feedforward correction function (step 2), a detailed performance metrics are summarized in Table A (Appendix).</p>

          <p>By introducing a feedforward nonlinear compensation, the tracking of the state-feedback control is better improved in both simulation and real-time experiments with small errors that represent other effect that might not represented or the lack of the traditional integrator action to cancel the steady state errors. Therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>, we compared the results of adding the nonlinear compensation function (SFC-NC) against the state-feedback baseline controller (SFC) without it. The tracking oscillations are decreased from a fitness function of 41.12 to 30.89 after the compensation function. This reduction demonstrates that compensating unmodeled nonlinearities (friction, backlash, dead-zone) brings experimental performance closer to ideal simulation conditions (near to fitness = 26.5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> with state-feedback in simulation). This approach is consistent with previous work showing that accurate friction estimation enhances pendulum control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] and that signal-compensation methods can reduce unmodeled nonlinearities in RIP systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p>

            <title>4.3. Adaptive integrator action with nonlinear compensation and state-feedback control</title>
          
          <p>Even though compensation-based state-feedback controller (SFC-NC) gave better tracking performance by reducing the tracking oscillations and errors, it still needs some extra work to get a satisfactory result including, reducing the existed maximum overshoots and settling-time for rapid real-time response and even cancel the steady state errors using the traditional integrator effect. Adding an integral action in feedback control rises as a simple yet efficient solution for eliminating steady-state errors when the system output fails to reach the desired setpoint. In PID controllers, the integral term accumulates the error and adjusts the control input, ensuring convergence to the reference signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. In underactuated systems such as the inverted pendulum, integral action improves robustness to uncertainties and reduces residual bias, making it an effective way for accurate stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>We notice from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> and its corresponding detailed metrics in Table A (Appendix) that by tracking the desired arm angle now is much better in settling time response (<inline-formula>

            <title>4.5. Tuned nonlinear compensation with integrator action for both anfis and state-feedback controllers</title>
          
          <p>To push the experiments further, we tuned manually the nonlinear compensation function associated with the ANFIS-PID controller and integrator action (NCNF) to achieve our objective with the best performance across all tested configurations. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> with the corresponding performance metrics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>. </p>

          <p>We can notice by comparing to state-feedback control with tuned-nonlinear-compensation and integrator action (SFC with tuned-NC and integrator), the proposed ANFIS with the same tuned nonlinear compensation and integrator design (ANFIS with tuned-NC and integrator called NCNF) achieved lower maximum overshoot from L = 3.7% and U = 3.1% to L = 0.8%, U = 2.5% in real-time experiment.</p><p>Moreover, smaller steady-state error of 0.30° for ANFIS with tuned-NC and integrator (NCNF control) against 0.42° for SFC with tuned-NC and integrator. Settling times of L = 0.618 and U = 0.726 for NCNF against L = 0.762 and U = 0.726 for SFC with tuned-NC and integrator.</p><p>To assess the robustness of the NCNF control strategy, each real-time experiment was repeated five times under identical conditions. The mean system response, shown with different colors for each subplot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>, is accompanied by a shaded region representing the <inline-formula>

          <p>To highlight the improvements achieved by the proposed NCNF controller in comparison to the SFC baseline in real-time validation, we summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref> using bar-graph the performance metrics for both controllers. The fitness function index is improved from 41.12 to 25.23 showing that the NCNF controller integrates nonlinear compensation with adaptive fuzzy learning to provide a smoother and more accurate control method for the underactuated systems like the rotary inverted pendulum.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>We presented the design and experimental validation of a Nonlinear Compensation-based Neuro-Fuzzy (NCNF) controller for balancing the Quanser rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) and compared it with a pole-placement state-feedback controller. The RIP system itself has nonlinear dynamics, but in practice the hardware also adds undesired nonlinear effects such as Coulomb friction, dead-zone, and mechanical backlash. The contribution of the NCNF controller is a hardware-based architecture that combines real-time nonlinear compensation with an ANFIS-tuned PID in one controller. Unlike standard ANFIS-PID and sliding-mode designs that treat these effects as disturbances, our method cancels them continuously using a feedforward correction. Both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments using varying square-wave reference showed that the proposed NCNF controller worked better than the baseline state-feedback controller in terms of reduced overshoots, lower steady-state errors and the defined fitness index. The results indicate that nonlinear compensation, together with adaptive neuro-fuzzy control, can indeed increase robustness and make the balancing better for underactuated systems. As a result, bringing experimental performance closer to the ideal simulated conditions. Future work will cover the extension to swing-up control to move the pendulum from downward position and validate the controller on more varying conditions.</p>
