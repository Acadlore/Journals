      <abstract><p>This study investigates the correlation between familial backgrounds and academic performance among secondary school students. Previous research supports the assertion that parental involvement constitutes a significant factor in a child's educational journey, representing their primary exposure to societal and educational structures. To achieve the research objective, three main research questions were addressed. A survey-based approach was adopted, implementing a random sampling technique to select a total of 66 respondents, consisting of 40 females and 26 males. Data were gathered through questionnaires and subsequently analyzed using descriptive statistics. The data were presented in tabular form to facilitate a clearer understanding of students' perceptions of familial background and its potential effects on academic achievement. The study revealed a pronounced positive correlation between family background and student academic performance within the learning institution. The study concludes that familial socioeconomic status plays a pivotal role in student academic outcomes. Thus, a collaborative approach involving both parents and educators in children's educational activities is recommended to enhance academic achievement.</p></abstract>

            <title>1.1. Research background</title>
          
          <p>Education, a fundamental process and system designed to enhance the quality of a nation's population, serves as the cornerstone of human development and labor-force quality throughout childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Aderinoye &amp;amp;amp; Ojokheta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Baghmalek, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Gryshova et al., 2017</xref>). Institutional learning during childhood not only influences individual achievement and well-being but also reshapes the labor force and the capacity of societies to drive national growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Irwin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Li &amp;amp;amp; Qiu, 2018</xref>). In Cameroon, the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) plays an instrumental role in fostering an understanding of student challenges by bringing parents into classrooms. This interaction has resulted in a noticeable reduction in negative behaviors such as peer-pressure, disobedience, and juvenile delinquency in most secondary schools since the PTA's inception. Despite the emphasis on the impact of family background on higher education achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Goldrick-Rab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Hanushek &amp;amp;amp; Woessmann, 2011</xref>), it should be noted that educational achievement is a continuous process. The effects of prior stage achievements likely impact later-stage achievements, both cumulatively and probabilistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Björklund &amp;amp;amp; Salvanes, 2011</xref>). Consequently, the primary objective of mandatory education is to ensure equality at the onset of a student's learning trajectory, irrespective of their family background.</p>

            <title>1.2. Problem statement</title>
          
          <p>Family background plays a pivotal role in students' academic performance, influencing them in several ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Cian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">de Jong et al., 2022</xref>). These influences can manifest as difficulties in understanding key concepts due to language barriers, a lack of parental involvement, limited local studies on schools, and poor nutrition leading to health issues and consequent absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Khasawneh, 2021</xref>). This study aims to propose solutions to enhance the effectiveness of the teaching-learning process in light of these identified issues.</p>

            <title>1.6. Significance of the study</title>
          
          <p>The objectives of this research encompass the elucidation of the vital role family background plays in the academic performance of students, which is anticipated to be beneficial to educational personnel, government, parents, and academic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Ng &amp;amp;amp; Yuen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>For parents, the findings of this study are expected to elucidate the criticality of parental involvement in children's education, highlighting its substantial impact on enhancing academic performance. This serves as a cogent reminder of the pivotal role played by Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) in students’ academic lives. It is essential to acknowledge that parents bear significant responsibility for their children's educational outcomes. The European education model, wherein education is predominantly funded by the state, contrasts sharply with models where parental financial contributions may inadvertently foster a blame culture directed at educators.</p><p>For students, the study provides insights into the benefits accrued from leveraging familial support for academic advancement. High academic achievement, improved social skills, and better behavior are some of the positive outcomes. The research emphasizes the importance of fostering strong relationships with parents, who often serve as invaluable mentors and supporters.</p><p>Teachers stand to benefit through heightened awareness of the diverse cultural backgrounds of their students, which is crucial in fostering an unbiased and inclusive learning environment. This awareness is particularly salient in contexts such as Cameroon, where over 260 ethnic groups exist, making the educational landscape particularly diverse. Moreover, it is expected that the recognition of positive student outcomes will serve as a source of professional fulfillment for educators.</p><p>School authorities are expected to derive insights into devising effective strategies for promoting parental engagement, including organizing parent-teacher conferences and maintaining communication through phone calls. Such engagement is posited to be fundamental in fostering positive academic outcomes.</p><p>Stakeholders, including policymakers, will find this study significant as it underlines the importance of considering family background in formulating educational policies. This research may catalyze the development of legislation that promotes parental involvement as a cornerstone for enhancing academic achievement.</p><p>Lastly, societies at large are anticipated to recognize the instrumental role of family background in education, thus highlighting the necessity for parental investment beyond financial contributions.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The significance of family background in children's education has been highlighted as being comparable to the influence of educators, counselors, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Effiom et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Hrabéczy et al., 2023</xref>). This background has been linked to factors such as motivation, wellbeing, and performance within educational institutions. Extensive research has been conducted to ascertain the impact of family background on academic performance. This has prompted various stakeholders, including government and private educational institutions, to incorporate family background considerations within educational frameworks. This chapter synthesizes literature and relevant theories to elucidate the involvement of family background in children's education, as well as its relationship with academic performance. </p>

            <title>2.1. Synthesis of literature review</title>
          
          <p>The origins of a person’s family, encompassing social, racial, and financial factors, have been indicated to play a pivotal role in shaping the educational experiences and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Effiom et al., 2023</xref>). This section synthesizes the literature regarding the various types of parental involvement and their subsequent impact on academic performance.</p><p>Parenting has been identified as a primary avenue through which support for children’s learning is fostered by providing a conducive family environment. It has been suggested that educators can facilitate parental involvement through workshops, assistance in accessing support programs, and advocating for education-promoting behaviors, such as reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Mah, Skalna, Muzam, et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the role of financial stability as a determinant in fostering an enriching environment has been emphasized. It has been posited that children from economically stable backgrounds tend to exhibit higher educational achievements than those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>Communication is critical in parental involvement. The facilitation of communication channels, allowing for seamless interaction between parents and educators, has been deemed essential. The incorporation of multilingual platforms for parent-teacher conferences, coupled with regular communication through electronic means, is considered conducive to parental involvement. Furthermore, the advent of digitalization has seen the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in facilitating communication between parents and children through mobile applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Mah, Skalna, Munyeshuri, et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Volunteering within educational institutions is another direct means for parental involvement. Institutions are encouraged to create avenues for parents to assist within the learning environment and be cognizant of their voluntary responsibilities and opportunities.</p><p>Learning at home is another essential aspect of parental involvement. Educators are encouraged to furnish parents with resources to facilitate learning at home. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Muzam et al. (2023)</xref>, learning is bifurcated into formal and informal domains, where informal learning from parents is deemed to have a more significant impact than formal learning from educational institutions.</p><p>Decision-making in educational institutions is often a collaborative effort between educators and parents. It is vital for parents to be active participants in Parent Teacher Associations or Organizations (PTA/PTO), contributing to institutional decision-making processes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Mah, Skalna, Muzam, et al. (2022)</xref>, effective communication between institutions and parents is correlated with improved student performance and operational logistics within academic settings.</p><p>Collaboration with the community encompasses a holistic approach to parental involvement, taking into consideration community settings that include the school system and curriculum. The development of community service projects involving educators, students, administrators, parents, and policymakers fosters a collaborative environment. Inviting community leaders to partake in classroom activities and parental events is seen as beneficial.</p><p>In conclusion, this section has synthesized literature that demonstrates the multifaceted nature of parental involvement, underlining the importance of the family background in education. The ensuing section will delve into theories relevant to the family background and its relation to academic performance.</p>

            <title>2.2. Parental involvement in learning and academic performance</title>
          
          <p>It is widely acknowledged that education commences within the household environment. The salience of parental involvement as a determinant in children’s education has been well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ackah-Jnr, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Freeman et al., 2022</xref>). The propensity for academic excellence is observed to be directly proportional to the extent of parental involvement in the learning process. Engaged parents foster academically productive members of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdullah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Bryan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Kong &amp;amp;amp; Yasmin, 2022</xref>).</p>

                <title>2.2.1 Models of parental involvement</title>
              
              <p>A myriad of parental involvement models exists, encompassing an array of activities that engage parents in both domestic and educational settings, thereby nurturing a propitious disposition towards their offspring's education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Grolnick &amp;amp; Slowiaczek, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Kohl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Premo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Tang &amp;amp; Tran, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Topor et al., 2010</xref>). A distinction has been drawn between parental involvement activities and their impact on children’s attitudes toward educational institutions. It has been discovered that increased frequency of certain activities correlates with higher instances of disruptive behavior in educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Izzo et al., 1999</xref>), whereas a positive attitude towards learning institutions is associated with enhanced academic performance.</p>

                <title>2.2.2 Psychological aspects and family dynamics</title>
              
              <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Mah (2023)</xref> discusses the ramifications of parental bias and intrafamilial racism on children’s psychological well-being, which can subsequently impinge upon academic performance. Effective parental involvement is imperative in ameliorating biases among siblings and precluding the development of prejudicial inclinations within the family. Both fathers and mothers have been demonstrated to play significant roles in educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Bamber et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Bruno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Mayo &amp;amp; Siraj, 2015</xref>). The level of parental involvement has been identified as a more reliable predictor of academic success than either income or social status. Moreover, the efficacy of communication channels between parents and educational institutions is deemed vital for student success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Levin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Family structure and its financial standing have also been recognized as key determinants in children's academic performance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Dsw &amp;amp; WuWu (2021)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Miller (2021)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">Ngure et al. (2017)</xref> elucidate the impact of family dynamics and economic disparities on children's academic performance. Adolescents from financially stable homes are found to exhibit superior academic performance and adaptive behavior compared to those from less affluent backgrounds. Notably, a correlation has been established between a family's financial situation and the number of children, with wealthier families often having fewer children. Such families tend to allocate more time and resources to their children’s education.</p>

              <p><span>Children from single-parent households or those experiencing parental separation are found to confront emotional and psychological challenges which can adversely affect their academic performance. The absence of either maternal or paternal involvement has differing effects on children depending on their gender. The vital roles played by both parents in the holistic development of children are emphasized. Furthermore, the marital status of parents and the quality of their relationships have been found to significantly influence children's academic performance. Single-parent households often result in fragmented parental guidance which can hinder the educational progress of children.</span></p>

            <title>2.3. Impact of family background on academic achievement</title>
          
          <p>The family background has been acknowledged to significantly influence the academic performance of students through the cultivation of learning behaviors and the provision of an essential learning environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Coleman (1966)</xref>’s seminal report posited that family environments potentially exert a more profound impact on academic achievement compared to educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Coleman, 1966</xref>). It has been suggested that the positive attitudes and achievements fostered by responsive parenting are markedly contrasted with the outcomes observed in children subjected to demanding parenting. The underlying premise posits that parents possess the capacity to inculcate positive attitudes and behaviors in children concerning education, which is particularly salient given that academic performance is observed to be superior when parents demonstrate engagement with school activities and provide the necessary support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Ryan &amp;amp; Deci, 2000</xref>).</p><p>A plethora of research has substantiated the integral role of the family in academic achievement, particularly underscoring the importance of a robust nexus between home-based learning and formal educational institutions. The family environment is characterized by numerous features, including socio-economic status, family structure, and parental education, which collectively contribute to the educational experiences and outcomes of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Amato &amp;amp; Keith, 1991</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the socio-economic milieu in which a family is situated significantly influences children's academic performance. Particularly in African countries, including Cameroon, disparate circumstances are observed to impact student achievements. For instance, children hailing from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds are often subjected to adverse conditions such as inadequate lighting for study due to electricity unavailability, lack of educational resources, and limited learning opportunities outside of school. Moreover, such children are reported to experience higher levels of stress and are sometimes encouraged by parents to associate with peers from more affluent backgrounds in an attempt to access educational resources.</p><p>Conversely, it is reported that families with favorable socio-economic backgrounds, characterized by positive parent-child interactions, are more likely to have children who are motivated and perform well academically. Furthermore, children whose parents are highly educated are often encouraged to harbor high aspirations, which subsequently translates into enhanced academic performance.</p><p>The findings of this study support the assertion made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Hargreaves (2002)</xref> that students in Germany experience fewer problems when both parents are actively involved in their lives. This involvement allows for the identification and resolution of issues, such as bullying, before they become unmanageable. The desire for quality education in Kenya is also shown to be of paramount importance, with students and teachers playing key roles as consumers and providers, respectively. However, the integrity of academic and family backgrounds is found to be compromised.</p><p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Bandura (1996)</xref>'s theory, the study reveals that parental and educator behaviors significantly impact students' learning experiences. It is therefore crucial for parents, teachers, and school authorities to model appropriate behaviors that align with the lessons taught in the classroom. This congruence between teachings and real-life application can lead to more positive educational outcomes for students.</p><p>In addition to socio-economic factors, family structure has been identified as a significant determinant of academic achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Marjoribanks &amp;amp; Mboya (2000)</xref> utilized family structure as an illustrative model to elucidate disparities in the academic aspirations of students in South Africa. The research further suggests that the attitudes of parents toward various societal factors, including economic and political aspects, directly impact students' performance. This influence is manifested through various experiences encountered by children, particularly in the domains of socialization, politics, and economics. These experiences, in turn, shape children’s reactions to real-world scenarios and their academic performance.</p><p>In conclusion, family background, encompassing socio-economic status, family structure, and parental involvement, is a critical determinant in shaping the academic achievements of students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Uwaifo (2008)</xref> underscores the necessity for comprehensive support systems involving both parents and educational institutions in fostering conducive environments for learning. It is imperative to recognize and address the challenges faced by children from disadvantaged backgrounds to ensure equitable educational opportunities for all.</p>

            <title>2.4. Theoretical framework</title>
          
          <p>Theoretical frameworks serve as the backbone of academic research, as they provide the underlying suppositions and statements about how phenomena relate within the research field. Two theories, namely Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Vygotsky's social development theory, are utilized in this study.</p>

              <p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Bakar (2022)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">McKenzie et al. (2012)</xref>, is a psychological framework that posits human needs in a hierarchical manner, typically depicted as a pyramid.</p>

              <p>In Maslow's model, needs range from physiological at the bottom to self-actualization at the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). It is posited that lower-level needs must be fulfilled before individuals can advance to address higher-level needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">McLeod, 2007</xref>). This theory is characterized by the intrinsic drive for self-awareness and the realization of one's potential. The applicability of this theory to the current study stems from the premise that an individual's academic motivation can be enhanced by fulfilling needs at various levels. For instance, when needs pertaining to love and belonging, such as family intimacy and connection, are satisfied, students are postulated to be more motivated to learn. However, it must be acknowledged that this theory presents limitations, such as the lack of empirical methods to ascertain the satisfaction of needs at each level and the progression to higher-level needs. Furthermore, the theory’s focus on only a segment of the human population represents a limitation.</p>

                <title>2.4.2 Vygotsky’s social development theory</title>
              
              <p>Vygotsky's social development theory, which was proposed in 1934, characterizes learning as a social process, and attributes the origin of human intelligence to culture and social interaction. According to this theory, learning first occurs through interaction with others and is subsequently integrated into the individual’s mental structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Blunden, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Smolucha &amp;amp; Smolucha, 2021</xref>). It is postulated that parents serve as "knowledgeable partners" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Jansen-van Vuuren et al., 2023</xref>), facilitating a child's learning through interaction. This theory accentuates the significance of family background and culture in learning.</p><p>It is posited that nurturing and positive interactions within the family environment can bolster academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Ceka &amp;amp; Murati, 2016</xref>). Hence, the effects of family background on a child’s education are manifested in academic achievement, and this study aims to elucidate the role of family background in learning outcomes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the interplay between parents, educational institutions, and teachers. Through the relationships established among these parties, understanding of student psychological needs is believed to be enhanced. Moreover, it is posited that the fostering of relationships between students and educational institutions contributes to the safeguarding of student safety and health.</p><p>In summary, the theoretical framework presented herein underscores the salience of fulfilling hierarchical needs and the role of social interaction in learning. These theories collectively serve as the foundation for examining the interplay between family background and academic achievement. Through the integration of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Vygotsky's social development theory, this study aims to offer insights into how the satisfaction of intrinsic needs and the dynamics of social interactions impact learning outcomes.</p>

            <title>5.1. Structure and organization</title>
          
          <p>The findings of this study reveal a significant impact of parental involvement on academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Ngoh, 2021</xref>). As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>, 87.5% of students strongly agreed that parental involvement affects academic performance, while only 12.42% disagreed. It was observed that students with a positive parent-child relationship performed well, whereas those lacking such a relationship performed poorly. The results suggest that a conducive home learning environment is associated with better academic performance. The level of seriousness with which students approach their studies appears to be influenced by the motivational messages they receive from their parents, leading these students to work hard to make their parents and families proud.</p>

            <title>5.2. Interpretation of findings</title>
          
          <p>The first finding reveals that parental involvement significantly affects academic performance, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>. A strong agreement among students (87.5%) supports the notion that parental involvement influences academic performance, while only a small percentage (12.42%) disagrees. A positive parent-child relationship was found to be associated with better performance, whereas the absence of such a relationship resulted in poorer performance.</p><p>The second finding demonstrates a strong relationship between family background and academic performance, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>. A majority of 51.3% of students agreed that family background is strongly related to academic performance, with a close 49.7% disagreeing. The third result suggests that a conducive home learning environment is associated with improved academic performance. The level of seriousness with which students approach their studies is influenced by motivation derived from their parents.</p><p>According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, love and belonging, including friendship, intimacy, family, and a sense of connection, must be satisfied before higher needs can be addressed. When these needs are met, students feel valued and motivated to learn, leading to improved academic performance, behavior, and social skills.</p>

            <title>5.3. Limitations of the study</title>
          
          <p>The researcher would have preferred to work with a larger population, but time constraints made it impossible. The results could have been more robust if more schools had been included. Financial difficulties in traveling between schools and providing materials for data collection were encountered. Additionally, some parents were unwilling to respond to the questionnaire. The study was also affected by time constraints, as the allocated time for this project was short and interrupted by other academic activities, which hindered the smooth execution of the research.</p>

            <title>5.4. Implications of the study</title>
          
          <p>The study highlights the importance of family background in education, as it plays a crucial role in determining students' academic achievement. Family background can refer to racial and social origins, financial status, or work experience (Collins English Dictionary). Education is an ongoing process, and academic performance is vital for securing further educational opportunities. Thus, it is essential to examine the role family background plays in children's academic achievement.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Coleman (1966)</xref> posited that families play a more significant role in students' academic achievement than schools and communities, as they provide the primary environment for learning. Furthermore, family social status plays a crucial role in children's academic performance. Family involvement in children's learning is positively related to achievement for students of all ages, and the more intense the involvement, the better the effects. Ongoing research indicates that family engagement in schools improves student achievements, reduces absenteeism, and increases parents' confidence in their children's education.</p>

            <title>5.5. Recommendations</title>
          
          <p>For policy makers: Policies should be developed to encourage families to actively engage in their children's education, as family involvement has been shown to foster academic success.</p><p>For parents: Parents are encouraged to adopt various types of parental involvement, maintain positive relationships with their children's teachers, provide conducive home learning environments, and volunteer in their children's schools. Parents should also make time to educate and help their children with school work, as this has been proven to be beneficial.</p><p>For learners: Students should be encouraged to communicate with their families and understand the importance of their parents' assistance.</p><p>For schools: Activities should be created to raise awareness about the importance of parental involvement in education and its effects on academic performance. This can be achieved through PTA meetings and workshops organized by schools.</p>

          <p>As this study was limited to GBHS Ekounou and Progressive Evening School Ekoundum, future research could be conducted in other schools, districts, or larger geographical areas.

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that family background significantly influences academic achievement. The importance of the role of the home environment in the realization of educational objectives cannot be overstated. It is widely acknowledged that charity begins at home, and thus, the foundation laid by parents and families is crucial for the success of students. Educators are responsible for building upon this foundation, but if the home environment is not conducive to learning and does not support the efforts of parents, there is a high likelihood that students will exhibit poor academic performance.</p><p>The evidence presented in this study strongly suggests that family background plays a critical role in shaping academic outcomes. In accordance with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Coleman (1966)</xref>, the family serves as the primary environment for learning and development, with social status having a noticeable impact on students' academic performance. A strong emphasis on family involvement and a conducive home learning environment is essential for fostering the academic achievement of children.</p><p>To elevate the quality of education and ensure the successful realization of academic goals, it is imperative that the contributions of family background are acknowledged and addressed. Future research could extend the scope of the current study by examining the effects of family background on academic performance in different schools, districts, or larger geographical areas. Additionally, further investigation could explore factors hindering family involvement in children's education and the influence of economic status on academic performance.</p><p>In summary, the study highlights the importance of family background and the need for a conducive home environment in the pursuit of academic success. It is recommended that policy makers, parents, schools, and communities work collaboratively to create a supportive educational framework that recognizes and addresses the critical role played by families in the academic achievement of their children.</p>
