      <abstract><p>This study investigated sustainable tourism practices in the aviation sector by assessing how passenger awareness and carbon offset pricing could be integrated into travel behaviors. With the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Emissions Calculator, the analysis covered five Thai Airways routes from Thailand to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Kunming, and Chengdu. The calculated offset costs per passenger ranged between 6.55 and 36.99 CNY, which were derived by applying a benchmark of 95 CNY/tCO<sub>2</sub>e (≈ 445 THB) to per-passenger emissions. These proposed offset contributions were not obtained from evidence of direct survey on the offset cost per passenger. On the other hand, the benchmark selected was based on the estimate in the international literature, anticipated price trends, and the goal of encouraging broader participation. The findings prioritized the importance of consistent terminology, explicit standards, and collaborative policies between public and private stakeholders to strengthen travelers’ engagement in carbon offset programs.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>China has emerged as one of the top tourist spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Lei et al., 2024</xref>) in the world as tourism has gained popularity. Ever since the visa-free policy for China has been in force from March 1, 2024, there has been a significant rise in the influx of tourists, especially to big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Harbin, and Chengdu. The growth of eco-tourism in China, particularly in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, has stirred a great deal of interest among Thai travelers, thus emphasizing sustainable travel development and cross-cultural interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">Yang &amp;amp; Bi, 2024</xref>). Observations of public space consumption in urban China, especially cities like Guangzhou and Nanjing, indicated that Thai visitors were inclined to visit open public space or places of cultural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Culturally oriented sites like Shanghai and Chengdu have been specially designed for international tourists, including Thai tourists, by focusing on maintaining historical and cultural heritages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Kanekar, 2024</xref>). The cultural music, events, and festivals in Harbin and Xi’an continue to be fascinating attractions for Thai tourists seeking to immerse in deep cultural and heritage experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Homan et al., 2024</xref>), thus reflecting how cultural perceptions influence travel choices. As a large number of tourists opt for air transport, this in turn generates serious concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major cause of climate change. Extreme climate change would result in natural disasters in most countries and societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Liao et al., 2022</xref>). Consisting mainly of CO₂, aviation emissions account for approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a substantial and increasing share that underscores the urgency of climate mitigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Laphet &amp;amp; Tandamrong, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Kapoor, 2020</xref>). Recognizing this, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations specialized agency, launched the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in January 2021. The program mandates that airlines operating internationally report CO₂ emissions every year and offset the surplus, with a long-term goal of achieving net-zero emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Ebissa et al., 2023</xref>). While the CORSIA emphasizes the requirement for offsetting, it does not reduce the burden on the aviation industry to reduce emissions through technology. The mitigating strategies, which include considering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), enhancing fuel efficiency, and developing innovative technologies, echo the environmental sustainability commitment and social responsibility of airlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">International Air Transport Association, 2023</xref>).</p><p>With the growing importance of sustainable tourism, this research aimed to evaluate passengers’ attitudes toward carbon credit offsetting by tourists traveling from Thailand to China. The views of full-service airlines will be vital for understanding how awareness and willingness to invest in carbon credits could be effectively integrated into travel habits, thus contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Al-Abdulqader et al., 2025</xref>). The study also emphasized the need for effective communication to enrich passengers’ knowledge of the impact of aviation on health, lifestyle, and the environment. Airlines typically provide such information to strengthen passengers’ understanding of the importance of carbon credits. Existing literature suggested that environmental awareness significantly influenced passengers’ offset cost per passenger for carbon offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Park et al., 2024</xref>). Active participation of passengers could be encouraged by arousing their awareness of the values of carbon offset programs, supporting reforestation or establishing renewable energy. Promoting eco-friendly initiatives is a question of presenting quality information and targeted marketing; training airline staff in environmental communication can prove particularly effective. Simple and accessible information on the advantages and proper use of carbon credits will enable travelers to make knowledgeable decisions.</p><p>To recapitulate, environmental awareness among passengers is crucial as it directly affects their offset cost per passenger for carbon credits. Publicity and educational campaigns advocating for environmentally conscious travel behavior will heighten their awareness of the environmental impact of aviation. This will complement the overall shift to curb pollution and greenhouse gases in the aviation sector to a great extent. Developing policies and programmers that prioritize environmental education, open communication, and culturally sensitive messaging will be key to improving the uptake of carbon credit schemes among tourists, especially in multicultural and international itineraries like Thailand-China toward global, culturally inclusive, and carbon-neutral tourism.</p>

            <title>2.1. Carbon offsets and market mechanisms</title>
          
          <p>Carbon offsets represent the amount of greenhouse gases reduced or sequestered through mitigation projects relative to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO<sub>2</sub>e), carbon offsets must be certified under recognized standards before being traded between entities seeking to offset emissions and those that have achieved reductions. Projects generating carbon offsets typically fall into two categories: (1) emission reduction or avoidance, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and waste management; and (2) greenhouse gas removal or nature-based sequestration, including carbon capture and storage technologies and reforestation initiatives.</p><p>In Thailand, the Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">TGO, 2025</xref>) facilitates a carbon credit market that allows offsets to be traded, and provides a mechanism for accounting and pricing the social costs of emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">Rosales et al., 2021</xref>). Full-service airlines, such as Thai Airways, are key participants in this market. By integrating carbon offsets into ticket pricing or offering them as optional add-ons, airlines could address rising consumer demand for environmentally responsible travel. Evidence from survey indicates that carbon offset compensation extends across multiple sectors, including agriculture, forestry, energy, transport, tourism, banking, finance, aviation, and Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). Airlines often utilize carbon offset tools, such as the ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator, to efficiently estimate passenger emissions and determine appropriate offset contributions.</p>

            <title>2.2. Carbon neutral tourism</title>
          
          <p>Tourism significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, both directly through transportation and indirectly via related activities. With increasing passenger travel, longer journeys, and escalating energy consumption, the transport sector accounts for a growing share of tourism-related emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Wang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Carbon Neutral Tourism refers to practices designed to balance emitted CO₂ with equivalent offsets, in order to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Ranasinghe et al., 2021</xref>). This approach combines strategies to reduce emissions from tourism operations with measures to compensate for residual emissions. For example, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) emphasized the importance of accelerating climate action in tourism to enhance sector resilience and mitigate its contribution to global warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">UNWTO, 2025</xref>).</p><p>In Thailand, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has adopted the principle to “adjust, reduce, and compensate” for guiding tourism businesses toward carbon-neutral operations. Under this framework, conventional tourism activities are redesigned to minimize carbon intensity, whereas carbon offsets are adopted to neutralize unavoidable emissions. These initiatives, supporting the sustainability and accountability of the national tourism sector, align with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Model in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">NSTDA, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">TAT, 2022</xref>).</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>The Scopus database was searched, in January 2025, using combinations of the following search terms: "carbon" AND "offset" AND "aviation". A total of 120 articles were identified through the screening process; among them, 30 articles were specifically related to carbon credit offsets for airline passengers. It was discovered from further classification that 16 articles were related to the monetary amounts of carbon credit offsets, 3 articles studied the percentage of carbon credit offsets, and 11 articles examined carbon credit offsets without directly surveying passengers, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. The number of papers included aligns with the criteria established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Pickering &amp;amp; Byrne (2014)</xref>, which stipulates a range of 15 to 300 papers for a systematic review.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, eleven articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Bazrbachi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Dray et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Guix et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Le, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Lee &amp;amp; Koo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Liao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Pimiä et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Wendt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">Yirgu &amp;amp; Kim, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>.) have examined airline carbon offsets, but none include passenger surveys regarding the amount contributed to carbon credits to offset their purchases. The relevant section of the research is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. The study on carbon credit compensation across various industries revealed that Thailand lacked a comprehensive carbon credit compensation scheme currently, particularly within the aviation sector. The researcher evaluated the carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere by commercial aircraft operating at their maximum capacity for each model commonly in use today, with a particular study on popular routes frequently traveled by tourists to China. The study focused on aircraft such as Airbus A320 and A350, as well as Boeing B737 and B777, among others. The popular routes analyzed involve Bangkok (BKK) to Shanghai (PVG), Bangkok (BKK) to Guangzhou (CAN), Bangkok (BKK) to Beijing (PEK), Bangkok (BKK) to Kunming (KMG), and Bangkok (BKK) to Chengdu (TFU), considering seats for both Business and Economy Classes. Moreover, the study aimed to determine an appropriate amount of carbon offsets that airlines could adopt as a policy and potentially enhance as an additional charge for Thai passengers in the future.</p>

            <title>3.1. Data acquisition</title>
          
          <p>The average Thai voluntary carbon credit price was 305 THB/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in year 2024. However, this study adopted a higher benchmark of 445 THB/tCO<sub>2</sub>e (≈ 95 CNY). The benchmark was selected based on three reasons: (i) it aligns with international willingness to pay (WTP) as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, which typically reports higher benchmarks than the Thai domestic average; (ii) it anticipates upward trends in global carbon credit prices; and (iii) it provides a normative basis for encouraging stronger participation in voluntary offsetting schemes. To test the robustness, a sensitivity analysis was recommended using both the Thai market average of 305 THB and the benchmark of 445 THB. This would enhance methodological transparency and ensure practical feasibility, given the purchasing power of Thai travelers.</p>
          <p>An average benchmark price of 95 CNY/tCO<sub>2</sub>e was used to calculate the proposed per-passenger carbon offset contributions for Thai travelers. The emissions factor applied is 0.3284 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e per kg of fuel, based on the Thai National Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Database, TIIS-MTEC-NSTDA. To estimate per-passenger contributions, the study analyzed five popular routes from Bangkok to China: Shanghai (PVG), Guangzhou (CAN), Beijing (PEK), Kunming (KMG), and Chengdu (TFU). Aircraft models commonly used on these routes, including Airbus A320 and A350, as well as Boeing B737 and B777 series were considered. Seats for both Economy and Business Classes were included in the calculations.</p><p>The per-passenger carbon offset (Cos) was calculated as follows:</p>

      <title>4. Results and discussion</title>
      <p>The carbon offset calculations provide estimated offset costs per passenger, as derived from the ICEC and benchmarked at 95 CNY/tCO<sub>2</sub>e (≈ 445 THB). The analysis involved five popular Thai airways routes commuting from Bangkok (BKK) to Shanghai (PVG), Guangzhou (CAN), Beijing (PEK), Kunming (KMG), and Chengdu (TFU) in China, with results differentiated by Economy and Business Class seating. For example, the Bangkok–Shanghai route (5,822 km, Airbus A350-900) yielded offset costs of 13.28 CNY for Economy Class and 28.49 CNY for Business Class, while the Bangkok–Beijing route showed higher costs of 13.66 CNY and 36.99 CNY for Economy and Business Classes, respectively. Shorter routes, such as Bangkok–Kunming (2,594 km), resulted in lower contributions of 6.55 CNY (Economy) and 14.44 CNY (Business). A complete summary demonstrating how offset costs vary by distance and aircraft type is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>. These values do not reflect direct evidence from passenger survey regarding willingness to pay but rather represent proposed offset contributions, consistent with benchmarks reported in international studies.</p>

      <p>The objective of this study is to synthesize evidence regarding carbon credit offsetting among tourists flying between Thailand and China, with a particular focus on the role of full-service airlines. The operating aircraft involved in the current calculation were Airbus A330-300, Airbus A350-900, and Boeing B787-900 across five major routes: Bangkok–Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Kunming, and Chengdu. Existing studies offered robust benchmarks; for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Hui et al. (2024)</xref> found that 86% of long-haul passengers in Hong Kong were willing to purchase carbon offsets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Schleich &amp;amp; Alsheimer (2024)</xref> in Germany examined domestic routes, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Geng et al. (2023)</xref> identified an average WTP of 86 CNY among Chinese passengers across domestic and international routes. Furthermore, broader European surveys confirmed consistent passenger support for offsetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdeta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Araghi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Berger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Rotaris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Seetaram et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Sonnenschein &amp;amp; Smedby, 2019</xref>). Although there is currently no definitive evidence for Thai passengers, related studies in Asia, particularly Malaysia, Taiwan, and China, highlighted passengers’ willingness to contribute for offsetting programs on both short-haul and long-haul flights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Danish et al., 2018</xref>). Building on the literature, the present study proposed a benchmark price of approximately 25 EUR/tCO<sub>2</sub>eq, with the intention of channeling funds to the offsets in the forestry sector.</p><p>Instead of providing descriptive accounts of tourist destinations, this analysis underscored two insightful comments. First, demand for Chinese tourism is anticipated to remain strong in 2024 and beyond, hence reinforcing the importance of embedding offset schemes into high-traffic routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Huang, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Xue &amp;amp; Bai, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Zhao &amp;amp; Yuan, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Zhao &amp;amp; Sun, 2024</xref>). Second, international policy frameworks such as the CORSIA progressively incorporate the impacts of climate change into the establishment of aviation regulations, further strengthening standardized offset pricing and its associated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Prussi et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

      <title>5. Policy recommendations for both the public and private sectors</title>
      <p>To effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, clear carbon offset standards should be established to ensure transparency and effectiveness in compensating for emissions from commercial flights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Gupta, 2024</xref>). The government should play a crucial role in supporting local carbon credit projects by investing in initiatives such as reforestation, land rehabilitation, and renewable energy development. These projects not only help generate carbon credits but also create economic opportunities for local communities while mitigating environmental impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Cordes, 2020</xref>). In addition, tourism authorities should take an active role in designing carbon offset programs for tourists, such as integrating carbon credit purchases into flight tickets or offering incentives for travelers who voluntarily participate in offset programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">de Mello, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Raising public awareness and public engagement are indispensable to achieving the success of carbon offsetting, a critical step in promoting sustainable travel. Governments and organizations should educate the public by conducting campaigns via various media platforms to emphasize the environmental impacts of air travel and the advantages of offsetting emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Fabiana Peixoto de &amp;amp; Rosario, 2024</xref>). Furthermore, investing in research and development of novel technologies such as energy-efficient aircraft and alternative fuels would contribute to long-term emission reductions in the aviation sector. Lastly, fostering collaboration among the government, private sector, and local communities could be conducive to the successful implementation of carbon offset projects, leading to both environmental and economic benefits for society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Heitmann, 2023</xref>).</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper conducted a study on the carbon credit offsetting for air travel between Thailand and China. The significant contributions and findings can be summarized into three main areas. First, it delivers empirical evidence by quantifying offset costs per passenger across five major routes from Bangkok to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Kunming, and Chengdu using the ICEC. These quantitative findings established benchmark values to guide the design of offset program in the absence of Thai-specific willingness to pay surveys.</p><p>Second, it demonstrates the methodological value of integrating the ICAO-based emission calculations with evidence garnered from the international research. This approach guaranteed that the recommended benchmark price of approximately 95 CNY/tCO<sub>2</sub>e (≈ 445 THB) was both theoretically informed and practically relevant, while acknowledging that it exceeded the current average of 305 THB/tCO<sub>2</sub>e in Thai market.</p><p>Third, it highlights policy relevance for airlines and government stakeholders with the following recommendations: (i) establishing transparent offset pricing; (ii) integrating offset purchases into airline ticketing systems; and (iii) supporting domestic carbon credit projects in line with the CORSIA and Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Model in Thailand. By sharpening the conclusion around these three contributions, the study avoided redundancy and communicated its significance more effectively to an international readership.</p>
