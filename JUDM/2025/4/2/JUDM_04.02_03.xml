      <abstract><p>Urban resilience has become a central framework for advancing sustainable development in the context of escalating urban risks. To investigate the role of population density in shaping resilience, panel data from 114 large Chinese cities covering the period 2006–2021 (excluding the COVID-19 years to avoid potential distortions) were analyzed. A multidimensional urban resilience evaluation system was constructed, encompassing five key domains: economy, society, institutions, environment, and infrastructure. Resilience levels were assessed through the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), while a panel threshold regression model was applied to capture potential nonlinearities in the density–resilience relationship. Results demonstrate that urban resilience in China has exhibited a sustained upward trajectory, largely driven by advances in infrastructure provision and economic capacity. However, population density exerts a nonlinear “double-threshold effect”. At low levels of density, the effect on resilience is statistically insignificant; within a medium-density range, a pronounced negative impact emerges, constituting a “medium-density trap”; and at high densities, the adverse effects are attenuated, suggesting that urban systems may gradually adapt to intensified population pressures. This trap is most evident in regional center cities and rapidly developing urban areas, where governance capacity, infrastructure investment, and resource allocation have lagged behind demographic expansion. These findings highlight the stage-dependent vulnerabilities embedded in urbanization processes and indicate that resilience is not solely a function of density itself but also of institutional capacity and infrastructural adequacy. Differentiated governance strategies are therefore required, including targeted improvements in public infrastructure, strengthened institutional and administrative capacities, and the optimization of spatial configurations to accommodate density-specific challenges. By identifying the thresholds at which population density alters resilience trajectories, this study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of urban vulnerability and offers actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance resilience under conditions of rapid urban growth and high-density development.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Amid rising global risks and increasing urban complexity, urban resilience has become a key indicator for assessing a city’s capacity to achieve sustainable development [1], [2]. It reflects a city’s ability to withstand and recover from disasters and public health crises as well as its adaptability to maintain essential functions under continuous change [3], [4]. As high-density development and compound risks intensify, balancing risk management and functional performance has become a major challenge for urban planning and governance [5].</p><p>Population density is a core structural factor shaping urban resilience, influencing land use patterns, resource allocation, infrastructure capacity, and environmental pressures [6]. Moderate density can enhance infrastructure efficiency, promote social cohesion, and improve resource utilization, strengthening a city's capacity to absorb and adapt to external disturbances [7], [8]. In contrast, excessive density often correlates with higher pollution levels, infrastructure overload, and increased psychological stress from noise and environmental discomfort [9], [10], [11]. Low-density sprawl, on the other hand, is linked to spatial fragmentation, underutilized land, and inefficiencies in public service delivery, which together undermine urban resilience [12].</p><p>Existing studies have indicated that the relationship between population density and urban resilience is not strictly linear; the direction and intensity of this effect may vary significantly across different density intervals [13], [14], [15], implying that threshold effects may exist rather than a simple one-way response pattern. Particularly during the transition from low to high density, differences in systemic pressure and regulatory capacity across different phases may lead to fluctuations in resilience performance. While some research has preliminarily revealed such nonlinear associations, the mechanisms underlying these patterns, especially across different types of cities and density stages, remain underexplored and lack systematic empirical validation.</p><p>Based on this, the study takes 114 prefecture-level and above cities in China as the research sample. It constructs an urban resilience index system covering the five dimensions mentioned above, evaluates resilience levels using the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method, and applies panel regression and threshold regression models to explore the nonlinear effects and underlying mechanisms of population density on urban resilience and its subsystems. The goal is to provide theoretical support and policy recommendations for managing urban population density and advancing resilience-oriented urban development.</p>

      <p>The study of urban resilience has evolved into a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework encompassing five key dimensions: economic, social, environmental, institutional, and infrastructural. Within this framework, population density is a central structural factor influencing all subsystems.</p><p>In the economic system, moderate population density can help optimize resource allocation and promote the effective concentration of production factors, thereby enhancing a city’s capacity to respond to economic fluctuations and external shocks. On one hand, higher density facilitates information exchange and collaboration among firms, stimulating innovation and industrial synergy, which contributes to faster recovery and greater adaptability of the economic system [7], [8], [16]. On the other hand, excessive density may constrain production space, increase operational costs, and intensify pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises, ultimately undermining economic stability and resilience [17].</p><p>In the social system, moderate population density can facilitate neighborhood interaction and the accumulation of social capital, thereby enhancing community-based mutual support and the ability to respond to unexpected events [18]. However, when population concentration is high and spatial distribution is uneven, it may lead to strained public resource allocation and weakened community identity, triggering social isolation, competition for resources, and group tensions, which in turn exacerbate disparities in resilience across communities [19], [20].</p><p>Population density plays a critical role in shaping a city’s capacity to cope with environmental risks by influencing land use patterns, energy consumption structures, and ecological spatial layouts [21], [22]. A moderately high density is more conducive to the deployment of ecological infrastructure such as green transportation systems, centralized energy supply, and rainwater recycling, thereby enhancing urban adaptability to climate change and natural hazards [23]. Despite these benefits, when population density exceeds ecological carrying thresholds, it often intensifies air pollution, urban heat island effects, and green space degradation, weakening urban ecosystems’ self-regulation and recovery capacity [14], [15].</p><p>Higher population density places greater demands on urban institutional systems such as disaster response, public service delivery, and interdepartmental coordination [24]. In densely populated areas, the urgency and complexity of governance often drive improvements in risk early-warning and emergency response mechanisms, thereby enhancing institutional adaptability and responsiveness [25]. Nevertheless, in the absence of effective coordination mechanisms, such complexity can also lead to fragmented administration and delayed policy implementation, ultimately undermining the stability of institutional structures [26].</p><p>Regarding infrastructure resilience, population density is crucial in shaping urban systems’ spatial configuration and emergency response capacity. Densely populated cities are more likely to develop networked and large-scale infrastructure layouts, enhancing the operational efficiency and responsiveness of essential services such as water supply, electricity, transportation, communications, and healthcare [27], [28]. Nevertheless, when density becomes excessive, these systems may face overload risks. The failure of a single critical node can lead to cascading disruptions, exposing vulnerabilities in the overall resilience of urban infrastructure [15].</p><p>In summary, although their emphases differ, domestic and international studies have examined the complex relationship between population density and urban resilience. International research, primarily based on experiences from Europe, North America, and the Middle East, has emphasized the vulnerabilities of high-density cities in relation to public service provision, traffic congestion, and environmental carrying capacity [11], [18]. It has also stressed the importance of infrastructural resilience and ecological restoration in mitigating these risks [19], [23]. By contrast, studies in the Chinese context have focused more on the challenges of rapid urbanization, particularly the lag in public service expansion and governance capacity during the medium-density stage [12], [14]. These differences suggest that the mechanisms through which density shapes resilience in Chinese cities may diverge from those observed in developed economies, owing to distinct developmental trajectories and institutional contexts. Engaging more directly with international scholarship can help to identify the generalizable aspects of the density–resilience relationship, while at the same time underscoring the distinctive significance of the “medium-density trap” as a phenomenon characterizing large Chinese cities.</p>
