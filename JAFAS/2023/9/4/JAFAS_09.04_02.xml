      <abstract>This research delves into the impact of Information technology systems (ITS) on the effectiveness of internal controls, using Norman Ranch Limited, a subsidiary of Development Trust in Zimbabwe, as a case study. A mixed-methods research approach, incorporating a descriptive design and a cross-sectional study, was employed. Data were gathered through close-ended questionnaires distributed to 44 employees, offering a comprehensive view of internal control processes within the organization. Analysis involved Linear Regression to establish correlations, supported by data presentation through tables, pie charts, and graphs. Findings indicate a significant, positive relationship between ITS investment and internal control efficacy, particularly evident when senior management participates actively in the installation and continuous upgrading of IT infrastructure. This includes the review of IT system packages from other organizations. A key revelation is the enhanced efficiency of internal monitoring, a critical component of internal control, through strategic IT implementation. The study concludes that judicious investment in ITS markedly improves the effectiveness of internal controls. Furthermore, it posits that a synergy between IT systems, business processes, and human resources is pivotal in fortifying internal control mechanisms.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The integration of new technologies into business operations, as posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Zang (2022)</xref>, presents a dual impact, facilitating a transition from traditional to contemporary business methodologies. Businesses, irrespective of their nature, are confronted with inherent risks and opportunities, and their survival hinges on the efficacy of systems implemented to capitalize on these opportunities and mitigate deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">BigThink, 2018</xref>). In the realm of auditing, 'internal controls' refer to a suite of predetermined procedures embedded within an organization's operational framework, playing a pivotal role in ensuring organizational goal attainment. The significance of IT systems in fortifying these internal controls, particularly in record-keeping and other internal services, is increasingly being recognized. Instances of internal control lapses leading to detrimental consequences are not uncommon, as highlighted by the situation at the National Pharmaceutical Company of Zimbabwe (Nat Pharm). Reported by The Chronicle Newspapers (2019), Vice President Constantino Chiwenga expressed concern over corruption linked to weak internal controls, impeding access to essential medications for conditions like diabetes and cancer. This corruption, stemming from inadequate control measures such as policy enforcement, internal auditing, and monitoring, has not only compromised the National Pharmaceutical Council of Zimbabwe's performance and financial stability but also facilitated significant financial losses through clandestine import dealings.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">BigThink (2018)</xref> observes that despite the presence of internal controls within businesses, the persistence of fraudulent activities such as bribery, theft, and fund misappropriation remains a significant concern. Illustrating this, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC, 2022) reported a case at Hui's Brothers Foreign Exchange Company Limited, where the former branch manager fabricated customer settlements of an unpaid remittance totaling $7.6 million. This incident, occurring between November 23, 2021, and January 4, 2022, went undetected for six months, eventually uncovered by a newly appointed manager. This delay in detection underscores the laxity in internal controls, particularly the absence of robust measures to limit authority and safeguard critical information and financial details. Such lapses in control mechanisms inadvertently facilitated the concealment of fraudulent activities.</p><p>Further reinforcing the significance of strong internal controls, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Al-Dmour et al. (2017)</xref> highlights their impact on the reliability of financial information. Focusing on the role of Information Technology in strengthening internal controls in Jordanian commercial banks, Alberi posits that Accounting Information Systems (AISs) are integral to effective internal control systems in the banking sector. The integration of computers in AISs has enhanced management techniques in these institutions. However, Alberi's study revealed that inadequate internal controls result in financial statements that lack credibility and integrity. This situation is often exacerbated by poor monitoring and evaluation of accounting systems, leading to the production of inaccurate and manipulated financial statements, thereby obscuring the true financial state of the organization. Complementing this perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Dayamant &amp;amp; Ferdinal (2019)</xref> conducted a study on a financial institution in Jakarta, narrowing their investigation to the impact of internal controls on the quality of information. Despite the implementation of accounting information systems, the study discovered the prevalence of erroneous and inappropriate information within the financial institutions of Jakarta. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Dayamant &amp;amp; Ferdinal (2019)</xref> concluded that an efficient internal control system is imperative to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information within an organization.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Pindula News (2021)</xref> critically examines the challenges faced by Steward Bank, highlighting the bank's contemplation to close certain branches following incidents that cast doubt on their operational viability. The bank's struggles with bribery and poor operational performance were attributed to a weak management function, particularly in the areas of segregation of duties, performance evaluation, and staff rotation. This led to growing concerns among stakeholders regarding the safety of their funds, as the bank demonstrated an inability to effectively oversee its activities. The manipulations of system settings, unauthorized access to bank systems, document fabrication, and system breaches underscored the deficiencies in the bank's internal control system.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akanbi et al. (2022)</xref> emphasizes the pivotal role of the AIS in both the management of an organization and the execution of its internal control system. The study identifies inadequate internal controls as a significant factor contributing to fraudulent activities in many businesses, hindering effective operation and goal achievement. The incorporation of advanced computer systems, offering encryption of critical company information, emerges as a key solution, ensuring access is limited to authorized personnel only. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Thakur (2021)</xref> further elucidates that companies can bolster their operational performance through IT systems. Consequently, the adaptation of internal control mechanisms to align with the computerization of AIS is crucial for effective control. This adaptation, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Teru et al. (2017)</xref>, directly influences operational efficiency and the attainment of organizational objectives, a finding particularly relevant in the contexts that were the focus of their study.</p><p>The historical context outlined above serves to contextualize the challenges faced by similar organizations within the same operational environment as the case study. One such example is Nuanetsi Ranch, where the absence of dedicated computers for the Farm Supervisor has led to significant operational challenges. The necessity for the Farm Supervisor to use computers in the accounting department has resulted in the leakage of sensitive financial information and unauthorized data alterations by untrained personnel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Siyelew (2019)</xref> highlights the crucial role computers play in businesses, facilitating the collection, management, computation, organization, and visualization of consumer and productivity data through various software programs and online communication tools.</p><p>The present study, conducted by the author who was attached to the company for a year, witnessed the dismissal of the Finance Manager of Nuanetsi Ranch Limited in July 2021 and a Graduate Trainee in May 2022. These terminations were a consequence of allegations involving corruption, fraud, misstated financial statements, and concealment of misconduct. The Finance Manager was dismissed for fraudulent activities linked to the absence of segregation of duties and inadequate monitoring and evaluation of senior management's work. Specifically, the Manager was involved in embezzling funds under the guise of purchasing Accounting Application Systems, for which no evidence of purchase was provided. Similarly, in May 2022, a Graduate Trainee was dismissed for presenting misstated financial statements, advocating unauthorized reductions in inventory prices for personal gain, and making unapproved transfer payments. These actions not only affected the company's cash flow and payroll but also went undetected for over two years, leading to irrecoverable financial losses. These incidents at Nuanetsi Ranch underscore the repercussions of weak internal controls within an organization.</p><p>At Norman Ranch Limited, the decline in production efficiency and substandard financial performance can be attributed to insufficient evaluations and internal control mechanisms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Kayanda et al. (2017)</xref> points out that weaker internal controls, such as excessive manual workload, lead to poor operating performance in organizations. Additionally, the absence of robust authorization procedures at Norman Ranch raises suspicions of fraudulent activities and corruption. A notable concern is the potential unauthorized transfer of funds by top management, coupled with their engagement in multiple tasks, indicating a lack of segregation of duties. This issue is further evidenced by the high labor turnover experienced since January 2022. The diversion of funds for personal interests by senior managers, due to weak internal controls, has led to a shortage of funds for essential expenses like salaries.</p><p>Furthermore, the ranch's remote location, approximately 38 kilometers from the nearest residential area, exacerbates the lack of security measures. The absence of surveillance systems and alarms leaves the broiler production (6000-7000 birds per month) and approximately 5500 layer birds vulnerable to wildlife and theft. During a meeting on December 6, 2021, concerns were raised about the theft of broilers and a decrease in egg production, attributed to theft, as there are no designated warehouses or blast refrigerators for produce storage. The inventory rooms lack proper locks, allowing unrestricted access. Consequently, the subsidiary faces challenges such as theft, physical damage, and deterioration of inventory, leading to inaccurate stocktake figures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Martins et al. (2019)</xref> emphasize that effective physical internal controls include surveillance systems, a dedicated security department, proper locks, and secure warehouses. The fraudulent activities and operational shortcomings observed at Norman Ranch Limited are direct manifestations of inadequate internal controls within the organization.</p><p>In November 2021, Development Trust of Zimbabwe (DTZ) Norman Ranch Limited implemented the Palladium Premium software, aiming to enhance internal controls in the realm of application controls. The software interconnected various departments-Finance as the central user, Production, and all Managers-each with access limits based on their job grade. Despite this initiative, the lack of regular upgrades has rendered the software below standard, leading to its under-utilization. Consequently, the company continues to rely on manual accounting for significant transactions. This reliance poses challenges in monthly account reconciliation, compromising the reliability of financial statements and making the tracking of inventory and recording of transactions difficult.</p><p>The growth of Norman Ranch Limited underscores the need for robust accounting systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Madhushani &amp;amp; Jayasiri (2021)</xref> assert the critical necessity of accounting management for any business, especially to ensure stable cash flow. The ranch faces considerable difficulties in safely storing processed data and converting this data into valuable information. The manual handling of data, encompassing customer accounts and inventories, is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, often resulting in the need to navigate through extensive paperwork to locate specific information. One of the most significant deficiencies at Norman Ranch Limited is the absence of an IT department and an audit committee. This gap severely hampers the establishment of effective cut-off procedures and the development of reliable financial systems. The lack of these key internal controls contributes to the organization's challenges in maintaining accurate and trustworthy financial and operational records.</p><p>Norman Ranch Limited faces a significant challenge with the loss of source documents, impeding the continuity of record-keeping due to reliance on manual data entry. This issue has presented auditors with difficulties in gathering quality audit evidence. An audit conducted in July 2021 highlighted the compromised quality of audit evidence, primarily due to the unavailability of essential documentation. The auditors' report emphasized the necessity for enhanced internal controls. Since the revival of the company in 2019, the accumulation of source documents became unmanageable for the accountant, leading to their loss. As the company expanded rapidly, the manual maintenance of source documents and data became increasingly problematic. Dor defines a source document as an original record containing vital details that support or substantiate a transaction. The absence of such documents disrupts the audit trail and results in information loss.</p><p>At Norman Ranch Limited, the monitoring of internal controls is hindered by a lack of effective management supervision and review. The company operates with only a graduate accounting trainee and an accounting intern on-site, while the Finance Manager and accounting officers are based at the parent company in Harare, detached from the Ranch's day-to-day activities. Consequently, monitoring and evaluation of performance are inadequate. Furthermore, the lack of proper cash handling protocols has led to a deficiency in accountability. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Tavingofa (2017)</xref>, such a scenario creates an environment conducive to the commission and concealment of fraudulent transactions. The company's authorization procedures are also lacking. Currently, authorization is carried out only by the accounting graduate trainee and the farm coordinator or supervisor, deviating from the best practices of involving multiple responsible individuals in the authorization process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">BigThink (2018)</xref> emphasizes the importance of having a responsible person oversee daily transactions, as stipulated by ISA 220, to improve organizational performance through effective monitoring and evaluation of tasks and processes. The current setup at Norman Ranch Limited, with limited personnel involved in authorization, has led to poor decision-making, adversely affecting productivity and slowing down the company's growth.</p><p>Norman Ranch Limited, established and registered under the Companies Ordinances in 1938, was later acquired in 1989 by the late Vice President of Zimbabwe, Dr. Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo, as part of the DTZ, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akanbi et al. (2022)</xref>, in the Sunday Mail. The company, with its subsidiaries, primarily operates in the sectors of agriculture, tourism, and mining. Presently, Norman Ranch Limited oversees activities in other DTZ subsidiaries, including Greencroft Coffee Estates and Zagrinda. Located in the Chibi District, the Ranch engages in diverse ventures like game ranching, cattle ranching, horticulture, and poultry farming. It also maintains joint venture partnerships with agricultural organizations such as Mutirikwi Sugar Company and Zimbabwe Bio Energy, under which cattle and wildlife ranching operations are managed. In recent years, the Norman Ranch Limited has been exploring various projects, including macadamia cultivation, poultry farming, sugar plantations, and solar energy initiatives. However, the rapid growth and expansion have rendered its existing internal control systems ineffective, highlighting the need for enhanced controls to manage the increasing volume of data, transactions, and asset security.</p><p>The organization has historically been influenced by political factors, being a quasi-government entity. Issues such as fraud, money extortion, and unqualified management decision-making have impacted its operations. These challenges, coupled with a high rate of corruption and ineffective internal controls, led to the financial downfall of the Trust. From around 2016, Norman Ranch Limited and DTZ Subsidiaries faced significant difficulties due to fraud and money laundering, largely attributed to the absence of robust internal controls. The situation was so dire that the Ranch was on the verge of closure and required intervention, leading to the appointment of a new Board by President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2019.</p><p>Since 2019, under new management, NRL has been undergoing significant changes. A new General Manager was appointed to spearhead organizational development and financial revitalization. The management team, recruited in 2020, has been diligently working to steer the organization back on track. Currently, NRL plays a critical role in the operations of DTZ subsidiaries, supporting them until they can operate independently. The initiation of new projects within the subsidiaries marks a phase of active development. Empirical studies have established a correlation between strong internal controls and investment in technology. This connection has prompted the researchers to undertake the current study, aiming to explore the impact of technological investments on internal control effectiveness within the context of Norman Ranch Limited and its subsidiaries.</p>

This aligns with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Lutui &amp;amp; Ahokovi (2018)</xref>, who found that implementing an e-accounting system can enhance financial performance while reducing internal control risks.</p><p>- Dearth of Computers: A mean score of 3.722 suggested that the scarcity of computers in the firm negatively affects financial outcomes.</p><p>- Fraud and Corruption: Both these factors also recorded a high mean of 4.38, underscoring the significant impact of fraudulent activities and corruption on an organization's financial health. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Al-Khasawneh (2017)</xref> who noted that weak internal controls are conducive to fraud, adversely affecting revenue.</p><p>- Cumbersome Work and Errors: A mean score of 4.0 pointed to the need for Norman Limited to enhance its information infrastructure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Al-Khasawneh &amp;amp; Ali Al-Oqool (2019)</xref> observed that strong internal controls minimize errors and promote efficiency, thereby improving financial performance.</p><p>- Increased Labour Turnover: The mean score of 3.94 correlated with the issue of employee attrition at Norman Limited due to delayed salary payments linked to fraudulent activities. This situation has resulted in decreased revenue and payroll issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdulle et al. (2019)</xref> found that ineffective internal controls can diminish staff morale, leading to higher turnover and reduced operating profits.</p><p>- Education Levels, Poor Financial Reporting, Use of Archaic Computers, and Absence of Internal Auditors: These factors shared a mean of 3.08, suggesting that there is a need for staff retraining to facilitate the adoption of advanced accounting systems. Additionally, replacing outdated computers with modern ones could significantly enhance the company's accounting capabilities.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref> consolidates the opinions of respondents on potential mitigation strategies for challenges encountered during the implementation of information systems at Norman Ranch Limited. These recommendations align with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Almalki et al. (2017)</xref> and are as follows:</p><p>- Continuous Employee Training: The highest average mean score of 4.4 suggests that continuous training of employees to familiarize them with the system is crucial. This not only makes them compatible with the new system but also boosts their morale, as agreed upon by the respondents.</p><p>- Vendor Relationship and Professional Hiring: Closely following with an average mean of 4.3 is the recommendation to establish a solid relationship with the vendor for better system understanding and the hiring of professionals for the development of the information systems structure.</p><p>- Review of Other Organizations' Systems: An average mean of exactly 4.0 was observed for the strategy of reviewing information systems used by other organizations in the same field. This indicates that learning from the experiences of similar entities is seen as a key approach.</p><p>- Acknowledgment of Staff During Implementation: The respondents agreed, with an average mean of 3.9, that acknowledging and involving staff during the implementation of the information system is significant.</p><p>- Senior Management's Involvement: An average mean of 3.7 supports the idea that the presence and commitment of senior management during the design and implementation phases are essential in addressing challenges.</p><p>- Qualified Personnel for Separation of Duties: Interestingly, a low average mean of 1.94 was assigned to employing qualified personnel to improve the separation of duties. This indicates a general belief among respondents that merely increasing staff numbers does not necessarily resolve challenges associated with system implementation.</p><p>These recommendations collectively highlight the importance of comprehensive planning, continuous training, active involvement of both management and staff, and learning from industry practices in mitigating challenges that arise during the implementation of information systems. The focus seems to be on enhancing human interaction with the technology rather than solely relying on increased staffing for effective system implementation at Norman Ranch Limited.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The findings of this study unequivocally demonstrate that weak internal controls, particularly the absence of advanced information technology, lead to significant challenges in organizational operations. Cumbersome paperwork, exacerbated by outdated or inadequate technological support, results in errors that detrimentally affect the financial performance of organizations. This is particularly evident in the context of Zimbabwean organizations, where the lack of efficient information detection and prevention systems has allowed fraudulent activities and corrupt practices to proliferate largely undetected.</p><p>A key revelation of this research is the positive correlation between information technology systems and the detection and prevention of fraud. The data clearly indicates that information technology systems significantly enhance an organization's ability to identify and mitigate fraudulent activities. This effectiveness is reflected across various parameters, as evidenced by the significant relationships established between information systems and several factors related to internal controls and fraud prevention.</p><p>However, a notable exception in this pattern was observed in the area of data processing control. The study found no significant relationship between the implementation of information systems and the improvement of data processing control. This suggests that while information technology systems are effective in several areas of internal control, their role in data processing control may not be as impactful or may require different approaches for effective management.</p><p>In conclusion, the adoption and effective implementation of information technology systems are crucial for enhancing the efficacy of internal controls in organizations. By strengthening these systems, organizations can significantly improve their capabilities in detecting and preventing fraud, thus safeguarding their financial health and operational integrity. However, it is important to recognize the limitations and challenges in certain areas, like data processing control, where additional strategies and solutions may be necessary to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
