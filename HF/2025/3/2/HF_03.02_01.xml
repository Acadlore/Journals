      <abstract><p>The pervasive integration of plastic materials into contemporary society has yielded substantial societal and economic advantages, yet has concurrently precipitated growing toxicological concerns with significant implications for human health. This study critically examines the multifaceted health impacts associated with chronic exposure to microplastics and plastic-derived chemical additives, including phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), flame retardants, and heavy metals. Through a comprehensive synthesis of recent toxicological and epidemiological evidence, the mechanisms through which these contaminants disrupt endocrine regulation, impair immune homeostasis, and compromise cellular function are elucidated. Cumulative exposure has been linked to heightened incidences of hormone-related disorders, carcinogenesis, metabolic syndromes, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Recent advances in analytical detection techniques have confirmed the systemic distribution and bioaccumulation of microplastic particles across human organs. Environmental vectors—such as air, water, soil, and food contamination—serve as major conduits of microplastic exposure, amplifying indirect toxicological risks through trophic transfer and persistent environmental deposition. Despite the mounting evidence of harm, current regulatory frameworks remain fragmented and insufficiently stringent, reflecting a lag between scientific understanding and policy enforcement. Addressing these deficiencies requires a paradigm shift from reactive risk management toward proactive prevention, encompassing the development of biodegradable materials, reinforcement of global monitoring systems, and the establishment of harmonized exposure thresholds. The synthesis presented herein highlights the urgent necessity of redefining plastic consumption and waste management practices to safeguard both human and ecological health, advocating for integrative strategies that align environmental sustainability with public health protection.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Plastic pollution has evolved far beyond the image of littered coastlines and clogged urban drains. It is now an entrenched, global, and transboundary crisis with deep environmental, economic, and public health implications. In 2024, global plastic production has exceeded 400 million metric tons annually, driven by rapid industrial expansion, consumer culture, and a fossil fuel industry increasingly dependent on petrochemical derivatives for revenue diversification. Alarmingly, over 11 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the oceans every year—a figure projected to triple by 2040 if current trends persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">United Nations Environment Programme, 2023</xref>). Among the most insidious outcomes of this escalating crisis is the formation of microplastics—plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size, either manufactured intentionally (primary microplastics) or generated through the degradation of larger plastics (secondary microplastics). Unlike visible waste, microplastics operate on a microscopic and often invisible scale, yet they infiltrate every level of the biosphere—from remote polar ice caps and deep-sea sediments to municipal tap water and the food people consume daily. Recent studies have confirmed the presence of microplastics in human bloodstreams, placental tissue, lung cells, and fecal samples, raising unprecedented questions about the long-term bioaccumulation of synthetic materials in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Leslie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Ragusa et al., 2021</xref>). Their presence is not confined to polluted zones; atmospheric transport enables microplastics to travel across continents, raining down on mountain ranges and agricultural fields alike. This silent diffusion of plastic into ecosystems and human bodies signifies not just pollution but systemic design failure, unchecked industrial prioritization, and a regulatory vacuum on a global scale. Addressing microplastic formation is no longer optional—it is a non-negotiable prerequisite for safeguarding ecological integrity, human health, and intergenerational equity. Understanding how microplastics are formed is the first step toward confronting their ever-growing threat.</p><p>Microplastics are broadly categorized into two types: primary and secondary microplastics. Primary microplastics are intentionally manufactured at microscopic size for specific commercial uses, such as pre-production plastic pellets (nurdles), microbeads used in personal care products, and microfibers shed from synthetic textiles. Secondary microplastics result from the environmental degradation of larger plastic products. Through mechanical abrasion, photodegradation, i.e., ultraviolet (UV) radiation, oxidative reactions, microbial activity, and macroplastics gradually fragment into smaller particles. This degradation is accelerated in marine environments, shorelines, and landfills lacking proper containment systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Andrady, 2017</xref>).</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>To conduct the literature review, a systematic approach was adopted to identify, screen, and analyze existing research on the toxicological impacts of microplastics on human health. Databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, were searched using keywords such as “microplastics,” “nanoplastics,” “toxicology,” “human health,” “endocrine disruption,” “oxidative stress,” “DNA damage,” “neurotoxicity,” and “pathogen carriers” in various Boolean combinations. The initial pool of publications was narrowed through exclusion criteria. Duplicates, studies not published in English, and papers that primarily addressed ecological effects without a human health focus were excluded. Priority was given to peer-reviewed toxicological and epidemiological studies, meta-analyses, and review articles that provided mechanistic insights into the interaction between microplastics and human biological systems.</p><p>Each source was assessed for relevance, methodological rigor, and contribution to specific thematic categories: (a) pathways of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption), (b) accumulation in human tissues and organs, (c) toxicological effects (oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, DNA damage, and inflammation), and (d) systemic health outcomes (respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurological impacts). Studies were also compared to highlight emerging areas of consensus and unresolved controversies, particularly regarding dose–response relationships and transgenerational effects. This methodological framework ensured that the literature review was both comprehensive and critically evaluative, synthesizing existing knowledge while identifying gaps in current research and directions for further study.</p>

          <p>Plastic is fundamentally a fossil fuel product, derived from the distillation of crude oil or natural gas. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, key feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and xylene are extracted during the refining process and chemically polymerized to create resins like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). These synthetic polymers are inherently non-biodegradable, designed for durability and mass production, not environmental compatibility.</p><p>This origin directly links plastic pollution to carbon-intensive industrial processes, locking in plastic as both a pollutant and a climate disruptor. Plastic production generates approximately 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. </p>

            <title>4.1. Introduction: from environment to organism</title>
          
          <p>The infiltration of microplastics into the bodies of living organisms marks a grim milestone in the Anthropocene. What began as an environmental concern—floating debris in oceans or plastic bags in landfills—has now escalated into a direct bio-invasion, with synthetic polymer particles penetrating the most fundamental units of life. These particles, defined as being smaller than 5 millimeters, are no longer just pollutants in the physical environment—they are biological contaminants, capable of moving through air, water, and food into internal tissues and organs. Once regarded as inert by-products of industrial convenience, microplastics have revealed their capacity to interact with and disrupt biological systems, often with stealth and persistence. The proliferation of plastic waste across ecosystems has created a planetary-scale exposure route: marine organisms ingest them at the base of the food chain; terrestrial animals encounter them in soil and feed; and humans are exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and potentially even skin contact. These pathways are not speculative—scientific evidence now confirms the presence of microplastics in human lungs, blood, placentas, and digestive tracts, suggesting a level of environmental contamination so pervasive that no organism can be considered isolated from its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Wright &amp;amp; Kelly, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, microplastics are not biologically neutral. They often carry with them a toxic payload—additives, plasticizers, heavy metals, and absorbed environmental pollutants such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides. Once inside an organism, these particles and their chemical companions may act as endocrine disruptors, inflammatory agents, or genotoxic materials, interfering with fundamental physiological functions. Alarmingly, some particles are small enough to cross cell membranes, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and even the placental barrier, raising the prospect of transgenerational exposure and unknown developmental impacts. This section investigates the mechanisms by which microplastics gain entry into living systems, the biological pathways they exploit for internal transport, and the systemic risks they pose to organismal health. From ingestion and inhalation to cellular translocation and organ deposition, the journey of these particles from the environment into organisms reflects a failure of both technological foresight and global regulation. Understanding this journey is not merely a scientific task—it is a biological imperative.</p>

                <title>4.2.1 Ingestion</title>
              
              <p>Ingestion is the most prevalent and well-documented route by which microplastics enter biological systems, affecting organisms at virtually every level of the food web—from plankton to apex predators, including humans. Due to their small size, resemblance to natural food particles, and ubiquitous presence in aquatic and terrestrial environments, microplastics are routinely mistaken for edible matter by a wide variety of species.</p><p>Consumption of food</p><p>Microplastics are entering farmland soils, leading to their absorption by growing crops. These microplastics enter the soil in ways like the application of sewage sludge and the usage of fertilizers. These microplastics are then absorbed by crops from the soil. They then pile up in edible parts and organisms eat them as food.</p><p>Trophic transfer</p><p>When smaller organisms ingest the microplastics, these particles can accumulate in the large predators as they eat them, potentially reaching the humans who eat meat.</p><p>Water</p><p>Microplastics can enter bodies through water, as water in rivers and groundwater are contaminated with these microplastics. Organisms drink that water and through that they enter the body.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Cox et al. (2019)</xref>, the average adult may ingest between 39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles per year, a figure that could double for individuals with high bottled water consumption. However, these are likely underestimations, given that nanoplastics (particles &amp;amp;lt; 100 nm) are difficult to detect with current methods and may evade filtration in laboratory sampling.</p>

              <p>Microplastics are found in both indoor and outdoor air environments. They can originate from various sources, including the degradation of larger plastic items and abrasion of synthetic fibers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. They are then inhaled by all the organisms, leading to the entry of these particles into the bodies of organisms, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. Airborne microplastics are present in both indoor and outdoor environments: synthetic fibers from clothing, furniture, and household dust; urban dust containing tire wear particles, plasticizers, and industrial emissions; and occupational exposure in plastic processing industries or construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Prata, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

            <title>4.3. Pathways of human microplastic consumption</title>
          
          <p>In humans, microplastics enter their bodies in many more ways:</p><p><p>Usage of plastic containers: Usage of plastic containers like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can lead to mixing of microplastics into food. When these plastic containers are exposed to environmental conditions like sunlight, they break down into smaller particles which mix into food. Consumption of that food leads to the entering of microplastics into the human bodies.</p><p>Cosmetic and personal care products: Products like face wash, scrubs, sunscreens, lotions, creams and other personal care products contain microplastics. These products contain primary microplastics in the form of microbeads. These primary microplastics are used to give an attractive look through glitter. As per a study conducted, 50% of face wash samples and 67% of scrubs confirmed the presence of tiny microplastics.</p><p>Clothing: Synthetic fibers also can break down to release microplastics. These microplastics or nanoplastics can enter the body through skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Napper &amp;amp; Thompson, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Single-use plastics: Single-use plastic cups, including paper cups linked with plastics, can release millions of microplastic and nanoparticles per liter into beverages during normal use.</p><p>Bottled water: Bottles of water are often made of plastics which, when exposed to environmental conditions, can cause the mixing of microplastics into drinking water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Liebezeit &amp;amp; Liebezeit, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Honey and sugar: Microplastics are affecting the honeybees through ingestion, causing deterioration of the quality of honey. In addition, the processing of honey and sugar and packaging of them cause contamination of microplastics into them.</p></p>

            <title>4.4. Bioaccumulation and organ distribution of microplastics in humans</title>
          
          <p>Microplastics, once inside the human body via ingestion, inhalation, or dermal absorption, are not simply expelled—they can persist, circulate, and ultimately accumulate in critical organs. Their retention is governed by particle size, surface chemistry, and the body's inability to efficiently metabolize or eliminate them. What was once a hypothetical concern has now been confirmed by clinical evidence: microplastics have been detected in blood, lungs, placenta, liver, and even breast milk. The accumulation of these particles suggests long-term biological entrapment, with poorly understood but potentially irreversible consequences.</p><p>Microplastic accumulates in many human organs. The effects of this piling have still not been completely studied. But studies have shown that these microplastics are accumulating in almost all organs of the body. Some can be mentioned below:</p><p>Gastrointestinal tracts (stomach and intestine): With ingestion as the main pathway, microplastics first accumulate in the stomach and intestines. Some particles may be excreted in feces, but others can penetrate intestinal walls and enter the bloodstream.Lungs: Microplastics which come with the air people inhale get trapped in the lung tissue. They get accumulated in alveoli and walls of lungs, causing inflammation and respiratory issues.Bloodstream: Microplastics can enter into the bloodstream in many ways like from the air in lungs and also from the intestine.Brain: These microplastics also enter into the brain and accumulate there, causing many neurological health issues. Studies show that 0.5% of the weight of the brain is made up of plastics.Liver: Liver is the main organ which gets rid of microplastics from the body. Therefore, there would be microplastics accumulated there.</p>

      <title>5. A clear link between microplastics and deteriorating human health</title>
      <p>There is a very clear link between microplastics and deteriorating human health because the entry of microplastics and accumulation of them in human tissues can create many complications in human health. Their small size can help them to even manipulate the DNA of cells, causing cancer. They can be consumed in many ways and people unknowingly are consuming a lot of microplastics. People think they are having a healthy lifestyle. But with food, water and even through air, people consume microplastics which are the biggest threat to human bodies. The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in human tissues and biological fluids has raised urgent questions about their potential health impacts. However, establishing a direct causal relationship between microplastic exposure and specific health outcomes remains a complex scientific challenge. This complexity arises from the intricate nature of human physiology, the long latency periods associated with many chronic diseases, and confounding factors such as concurrent exposure to other environmental toxins. Nonetheless, a growing body of mechanistic evidence reveals multiple pathways through which microplastics may contribute to cellular and systemic toxicity. This section critically evaluates these toxicological mechanisms, supported by quantitative data and recent literature, to delineate the emerging link between microplastics and deteriorating human health.</p>

            <title>5.1. Endocrine disruption</title>
          
          <p>Endocrine disruption happens in a human body due to its interaction with endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) like bisphenols, phthalates, etc. of plastics. These chemicals interfere with the normal functioning of all the endocrine systems by stopping the natural release of hormones. These EDCs enter the human body through microplastics by many mediums like water and food. These microplastics are very small, so they get absorbed into all the things. With a smaller size, they also have a higher potential to release EDCs. These EDCs can affect various endocrine components, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs such as testes and ovaries. For instance, BPA and phthalates, common EDCs in plastics, have been linked to reproductive health issues and metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus by altering hormone synthesis and action. Microplastics act as vectors for EDCs, including BPA and phthalates, which interfere with hormone receptor functions. Biomonitoring studies report positive correlations between microplastic burdens and BPA concentrations in human blood plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Talsness et al., 2009</xref>). Although it is difficult to isolate EDC exposure exclusively attributable to microplastics, the co-occurrence of these contaminants and their cumulative effects cannot be overlooked, especially given their links to reproductive, metabolic, and developmental disorders.</p>

            <title>5.2. Cardiovascular issues</title>
          
          <p>Many cardiovascular issues are caused by microplastics. The main reason for this is that phthalates found in plastics can disrupt heart rate and cardiovascular reactivity. Exposure to phthalates like di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) can lead to decreased heart rate variability and increased blood pressure response, potentially leading to hypertension and atherosclerosis. In addition, microplastics have been shown to cause cardiac fibrosis by activating Wnt/β-catenin. This can cause structural damage and oxidative stress on the heart. EDCs of plastics also contribute to cardiovascular issues as they affect the release of hormones. These increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as they affect adipose tissue and hormonal functions. While the majority of microplastic toxicology research has focused on respiratory and immune systems, growing evidence indicates potential cardiovascular risks associated with microplastic exposure. Microplastics, due to their small size and ability to translocate across biological barriers, can enter the bloodstream, potentially interacting with vascular tissues and circulating cells.</p><p>Microplastic particles and their associated chemicals may induce endothelial dysfunction, a precursor to atherosclerosis and CVDs. Oxidative stress generated by microplastics can damage endothelial cells lining blood vessels, impairing their ability to regulate vascular tone and maintain barrier integrity. Concurrently, microplastic-associated inflammatory cytokines promote chronic vascular inflammation, contributing to plaque formation and arterial stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Toussaint et al., 2019</xref>). Animal studies have demonstrated that microplastic exposure leads to elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate variability, and histopathological changes in cardiac tissue. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Liu et al. (2022)</xref> observed that rodents exposed to PS microplastics showed increased markers of oxidative damage in myocardial tissue and altered lipid metabolism, both key contributors to cardiovascular pathology. Similarly, in vitro experiments reveal that microplastic particles induce cardiomyocyte stress responses and apoptosis.</p><p>While direct epidemiological data linking microplastic exposure to human cardiovascular outcomes remain limited, the mechanistic evidence underscores plausible pathways for risk. Given that CVDs are the leading cause of global mortality, even modest contributions from microplastic exposure could have significant public health ramifications. The presence of microplastics in circulating blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Jenner et al., 2022</xref>) further substantiates their potential to impact cardiovascular health.</p>

            <title>5.3. Respiratory problems</title>
          
          <p>Plastics are mostly responsible for respiratory problems in humans. The effects of plastics on respiratory diseases can be listed below. Microplastics float free in the atmosphere and people inhale them when breathing air. These microplastics reach the deepest regions of the human respiratory system through bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsies. </p><p>Key effects caused by microplastics are:</p><p>These microplastics come in contact with the bronchial epithelium, promoting the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines, triggering a local inflammatory response that causes conditions such as dyspnea and asthma.Microplastics can cause cytotoxic and inflammatory effects in lung cells, increasing the production of ROS and inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). This can disrupt the protective pulmonary barrier and increase the risk of chronic respiratory diseases.These microplastics, when inhaled continuously, can settle in all the regions of the lungs, with deposition patterns influenced by particle size and shape. This can lead to lung failure over time.These can alter the DNA and promote genetic mutation, causing lung cancer.Airborne microplastics may cause lesions in the respiratory system, particularly in individuals with higher susceptibility, due to inflammatory responses triggered by inhaled plastic fibers and particles. </p>

            <title>5.4. Oxidative stress and cellular damage</title>
          
          <p>Microplastics have been shown to induce the production of ROS, which overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses and lead to oxidative stress. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Deng et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that exposure to microplastic concentrations as low as 10 μg/mL elevated ROS levels and lipid peroxidation markers in human lung epithelial cells. This oxidative stress results in mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA strand breaks, and apoptosis, processes closely associated with the pathogenesis of chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). The convergence of these oxidative pathways suggests plausible mechanistic links between microplastic exposure and long-term cellular damage.</p>

They observed DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aberrations in cell cultures exposed to PS nanoparticles at concentrations of 50 μg/mL. This genotoxicity implies a potential carcinogenic risk, although epidemiological evidence in humans remains scarce, underscoring an urgent need for targeted research in this area. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> shows the environmental pollutants and their effects on human health.</p>

            <title>5.6. Cancer risks</title>
          
          <p>Microplastics pose a potential risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>). Research indicates that microplastics can contribute to cancer developments through various mechanisms. These cancer-causing microplastics can enter the body through ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact, as they are present in air, food, water and consumer products. These plastics can increase the risk of cancer in many ways:</p><p>(a) Carcinogenic mechanisms: Microplastics and nanoplastics can induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, which are key mechanisms in the initiation and progression of cancer. These particles can generate ROS, leading to DNA damage and genome instability, which are critical steps in carcinogenesis. </p><p>(b) DNA damage and cellular disruption: These microplastics can also damage the DNA and disrupt normal cellular processes. This disruption can cause apoptosis and immune response alterations, further contributing to cancer development. Many plastic additives are known to have carcinogenic properties. Over 150 plastic additives have been identified with known carcinogenicity, highlighting the need for comprehensive assessments of these substances.</p><p>(c) Chemical contaminants: Microplastics can absorb compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the environment. These compounds, when ingested, pose a significant cancer risk, particularly when microplastics are enriched with such pollutants. Phthalates and bisphenol compounds in plastics are also considered potential human carcinogens. They may promote tumorigenesis through pathways involving the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Similarly, BPA and its analogs, bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF), are xenoestrogens that can act as endocrine disruptors and potential neoplastic inducers, affecting various cancer types.</p><p>(d) Biological impact: Microplastics accumulate in different organs such as the liver, kidney and gut, leading to oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances, which are the main reasons for cancer.</p><p>(e) Specific cancer concerns: There is a growing concern about the role of microplastics in early-onset colorectal cancer. Microplastics may disrupt the protective mucus layer in the colon, increasing exposure to harmful bacteria and toxins, which could contribute to cancer development.</p>

            <title>5.7. Gastrointestinal and liver dysfunction</title>
          
          <p>Microplastics and nanoplastics can induce liver damage and intestine damage through several mechanisms. The liver, the primary site for microplastic accumulation, is particularly vulnerable to its toxic effects. Microplastics are known to cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in liver cells, which can lead to liver fibrosis and other liver diseases. These particles can disrupt the gut-liver axis, leading to metabolic dysfunctions such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. Additionally, microplastics can alter bile acid metabolism, causing cholestasis and further liver injury. Secondly, ingested microplastics can damage the intestinal barriers, leading to increased permeability and inflammation. This disruption can cause the microplastics to enter the bloodstream, damaging other organs. This presence in the intestine causes many conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. The gastrointestinal tract is the primary entry point for microplastics into the human body, particularly through ingestion of contaminated food, water, and air. Once internalized, these particles interact with gut microbiota, epithelial barriers, and immune cells—disrupting digestive functions and potentially translocating to secondary organs such as the liver. A growing body of literature indicates that chronic microplastic exposure may impair gut homeostasis and induce hepatic toxicity.</p><p>Microplastics have been shown to compromise the intestinal epithelial barrier, increasing permeability (the so-called "leaky gut" effect) and facilitating systemic entry of particles and associated toxins. In rodent studies, exposure to PS microplastics resulted in reduced expression of tight junction proteins (e.g., occludin and claudin-1), critical for maintaining mucosal integrity. Simultaneously, microplastics disrupt the gut microbiota composition, leading to dysbiosis—a known risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic syndrome, and colorectal cancer. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Jin et al. (2019)</xref> showed significant alterations in bacterial phyla (notably reductions in Bacteroidetes and increases in Firmicutes) after chronic microplastic exposure in mice, correlating with low-grade gut inflammation and immune dysregulation.</p><p>Once translocated across the intestinal barrier, microplastics can accumulate in the liver—a critical detoxifying organ. Evidence from animal models indicates that microplastics induce hepatic oxidative stress, lipid metabolism disorders, and hepatocellular apoptosis. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Li et al. (2020)</xref> reported elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels—a key lipid peroxidation marker—in liver tissue of mice exposed to 5 μm PS microplastics, along with significant downregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">de Souza Machado et al., 2018</xref>). Histopathological analysis revealed vacuolar degeneration, inflammatory infiltration, and steatosis, resembling features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Moreover, changes in cytochrome P450 enzyme expression suggest altered detoxification capacity, potentially increasing susceptibility to hepatotoxic drugs and xenobiotics.</p>

          <p>Plastics can cause various skin diseases, particularly in occupational settings where workers are exposed to plastic materials and chemicals, often due to contact with specific compounds used in the plastics industry. These are caused by exposure to chemicals and not taking protective measures in factories. Some skin diseases which can be caused by plastics are:</p><p>(a) Contact dermatitis: It is caused by exposure to natural rubber latex, phenol-formaldehyde resin, and cobalt naphthenate. The symptoms of this condition are a rash on the skin being itchy and uncomfortable. Scratching the rash could break open the skin and cause a wound. If this wound becomes infected, it looks red and crusty and may be painful.</p><p>(b) Occupational skin disorders: In the glass-fiber-reinforced plastics (GRP) industry, workers frequently experience skin disorders due to exposure to glass fibers, dust, and various chemicals. These conditions are often mild but can lead to significant discomfort and, in some cases, require medical attention or sick leave.</p>

          <p>Plastics, particularly microplastics and chemicals like phthalates and bisphenols, have been affecting reproductive health. Microplastic pollution poses a particularly alarming threat to human reproductive health. As EDCs hitchhike on and leach from plastic particles, they interfere with the hormonal signaling systems essential to fertility, fetal development, and sexual maturation. Mounting evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies reveals that both male and female reproductive systems are vulnerable to microplastic-induced toxicity—an emerging crisis with generational consequences. </p>

              <p>Exposure to phthalates, commonly used as plasticizers, is associated with reproductive diseases in females, such as altered estrous cycles, ovarian follicular atresia, and prolonged gestational cycles. These chemicals disrupt hormone signaling and oxidative stress pathways, potentially leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes and developmental issues in offspring. In addition, bisphenols, used in polycarbonate plastics, can cause structural and functional damage to the female reproductive system by interfering with hormones and inducing oxidative stress. This can lead to conditions like cancer, reproductive dysfunction, and miscarriage. </p>

These particles can disrupt hormonal balances, leading to decreased testosterone and other reproductive hormones. Similar to their effects on females, plasticizers like BPA and phthalates can interfere with male reproductive processes, affecting hormone levels and leading to reproductive defects and decreased fertility.</p>

Studies on pregnant animals exposed to microplastics have shown placental transfer, intrauterine growth restriction, and altered gene expression in offspring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Kim et al. (2021)</xref> identified microplastics in human placental tissue, raising grave concerns about prenatal exposure. Animal data further suggest epigenetic modifications, such as altered methylation of developmental genes, hinting at possible transgenerational health effects that current research has yet to fully unravel.</p>

Additionally, the synergistic effects of microplastics with other environmental toxins are poorly understood. Standardized human biomonitoring and longitudinal reproductive health surveillance are urgently needed to move beyond correlation and toward causation.</p>

            <title>5.10. Neurological effects</title>
          
          <p>Microplastics and nanoplastics may accumulate in the brain, exerting neurotoxic effects across various species, including fish and mammals. Studies show that 0.5% of the human brain’s weight is plastic. These effects are primarily due to the ability of these particles to penetrate biological barriers and induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and other cellular disruptions. Some neurological effects of plastics are mentioned below. Microplastics can cause oxidative stress, leading to cell damage and more vulnerability to neurological disorders. This is evidenced by inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which may contribute to behavioral changes. While the physical accumulation of microplastics in organs like the gut and liver has drawn much scientific attention, the neurological risks posed by microplastic exposure remain an under-recognized but rapidly emerging concern. Recent research suggests that microplastics—and the toxic additives and adsorbed pollutants they carry—may not only penetrate physiological barriers like the BBB but also impair neuronal function, trigger neuroinflammation, and accelerate cognitive decline.</p><p>(a) Crossing BBB—a gateway breached: BBB is a highly selective shield meant to protect the brain from foreign substances. However, studies now indicate that nanoscale plastic particles ( &amp;amp;lt; 1 μm) are capable of breaching this barrier, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress or inflammation. In murine models, PS nanoparticles were detected in brain tissue within 24 hours of oral exposure, suggesting a direct translocation route via the systemic circulation. Once within the central nervous system (CNS), these particles may persist due to the brain’s limited lymphatic clearance mechanisms.</p><p>(b) Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation: Microplastics can induce ROS generation in neural cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. In vivo studies demonstrate elevated levels of MDA and nitric oxide in the cerebral cortex of microplastic-exposed rodents, indicating ongoing oxidative and nitrosative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Deng et al., 2017</xref>). Concurrently, microglial activation—a hallmark of neuroinflammation—has been observed, often accompanied by increased expression of cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), TNF-α, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). These inflammatory cascades are linked to neuronal apoptosis and synaptic dysfunction, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>(c) Cognitive and behavioral impairments: Behavioral studies on rodents chronically exposed to microplastics reveal impaired memory, learning deficits, and reduced exploratory behavior. In one such study, mice exposed to 0.1 mg/mL of PS microplastics for 90 days showed significant deficits in maze-based cognitive tests and reduced hippocampal neuron density. Such neurobehavioral changes suggest microplastic interference in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter signaling.</p><p>(d) Developmental neurotoxicity: Perhaps most concerning are findings related to fetal and early childhood exposure. Prenatal exposure to microplastics has been associated with delayed neurodevelopment, reduced brain volume, and altered neurogenesis in animal models. These changes may be driven by a combination of direct particle toxicity and endocrine disruption during critical developmental windows. Early exposure to EDCs carried by microplastics—such as BPA—has been linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), lowered intelligence quotient (IQ), and other cognitive disorders in children.</p><p>(e) Neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits: Exposure to PS nanoplastics during developmental stages can lead to brain abnormalities and cognitive deficits in offspring, indicating a risk of neurodevelopmental defects.</p><p>(f) Amyloidogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases: Nanoplastics have been shown to stimulate the aggregation of amyloid proteins, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, indicating a potential role in exacerbating these conditions.</p><p>(g) Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction: Both microplastics and nanoplastics can cause neuroinflammation and dysregulation of synaptic functions, contributing to neurological and reproductive toxicity.</p>

            <title>5.11. Pathogen carriers</title>
          
          <p>Beyond their chemical toxicity and physical persistence, microplastics serve as unwitting vectors for pathogens—bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites—posing a significant and underexplored risk to human and ecological health. Often termed the “plastisphere,” the microbial ecosystem that colonizes plastic surfaces transforms microplastics into mobile reservoirs of disease, biofilms, and antibiotic resistance. Microplastics offer a uniquely favorable substrate for microbial adhesion and colonization. Their hydrophobic surfaces, high surface-area-to-volume ratios, and residence time in aquatic environments allow microorganisms to form dense biofilms. These biofilms not only protect microbes from environmental stressors (e.g., UV light and salinity) but also promote horizontal gene transfer, enhancing microbial virulence and adaptability.</p><p>Microplastics have been shown to carry a range of pathogenic microbes, including</p><p><italic>Vibrio spp.</italic> (cholera and wound infections),<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella spp.</italic> (foodborne illnesses),<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (nosocomial infections),<italic>Candida albicans</italic> (fungal infections),Noroviruses (gastrointestinal illness).</p><p>In marine settings, <italic>Vibrio </italic>species have demonstrated a particular affinity for PE and PS particles. Not only do these pathogens survive longer on plastic surfaces than in seawater, but studies have shown increased expression of virulence genes when bacteria inhabit plastic biofilms—indicating that plastic colonization may enhance pathogenicity.</p><p>Microplastics act as vehicles for long-range dispersal of pathogens across oceans and coastlines. This plastic-driven mobility allows for the spread of invasive microbial species to new geographies, endangering local ecosystems and fisheries. In humans, ingestion of seafood contaminated with plastic-bound pathogens or contact with polluted recreational waters can facilitate zoonotic transmission. Additionally, airborne microplastics—now detected in indoor air, soil, and urban dust—may carry pathogenic bacteria and fungi directly into human respiratory tracts, particularly in enclosed environments with poor ventilation. Microplastics are not inert particles; they are dynamic, biologically active materials capable of harboring and transporting pathogenic microbes, and amplifying their survival, virulence, and resistance. In a warming, polluted world where pandemics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) loom large, the intersection between synthetic waste and microbial evolution must be treated as a critical frontier in environmental and public health research. Mitigation of microplastic pollution is not just an ecological imperative—it is an urgent infectious disease strategy.</p>

      <title>6. Survey results and discussion</title>
      <p>Through the use of Google Forms, a survey was conducted to ascertain and document several crucial pieces of information revolving around the use of plastics and their products and the basic knowledge that people possess regarding their widespread effects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> highlights the percentage of the participants aware of the potential health risks associated with the use of plastics. More than 90% of the participants were mostly aware of the potential health risks posed by the use of plastic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> shows a monumental question, since mainstream knowledge is still quite focused on the issue of pollution and recycling; amongst this, people completely overlook the plethora of effects that the use of plastic already poses and is greatly affecting human lives already. Countless people are still in the oblivion and are unable to establish any clear link between the use of plastic and their deteriorating standard of health. As the figure highlights, more than 18% of the participants did not have any clue about the potential health risks. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>, right information is even more important than just any kind of information. As the figure highlights, more than 90% of the information about plastics and their potential health risks comes from social media. Social media itself poses a great many issues. One of them is the prevalence of exaggerated and outright fake pieces of information. A lot of content on social media is unverified but still greatly prevalent and makes its way onto the feeds of the users. Only 27.3% of the information came from experts and informed people. And while the majority of the participants were students, less than 50% got their information from school or textbooks, highlighting a serious issue of the lack of education revolving around environment and sustainable practices.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref> highlights the urgency with which more campaigns must be launched with the focus of imparting information regarding plastics, their widespread and diverse effects and ways to tackle them. More than 60% of the participants come across this kind of information only sometimes. And less than 10% come across this kind of information on a regular basis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> highlights the prevalence of the use of plastic products in the participants’ daily lives. 45.5% of the participants use plastic products sometimes; 36.4% use plastic products on a regular basis. This clearly highlights the continued prevalence of use of plastics despite growing environmental concerns. This also showcases the inability of eco-friendly substitutes to make their way into the daily lives of the people. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref> highlights the growing concern of chemicals from plastic leaching into the food products. But a good proportion of the total participants is still oblivious to this reality. Despite the concerns being highlighted by the majority, the use of plastic products still continues, as highlighted by the previous graph. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref> highlights the fact that people are still becoming more aware and conscious of the effects that plastics and their products have on their lives. Despite this, the use of substitutes or rather the mere knowledge of eco-friendly substitutes which are available still remains at a low level.</p>

      <title>7. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Microplastics are no longer confined to the category of environmental pollutants; they are now firmly embedded in the narrative of human physiological disruption. This research set out to interrogate the health implications of microplastic exposure, and the evidence is not only disturbing—it is systemic. From ingestion and inhalation to cellular infiltration and organ accumulation, microplastics have infiltrated nearly every biological boundary once thought to protect the human body. The data shows that microplastics—by virtue of their size, chemical profile, and interaction with environmental toxins—act as chronic biological stressors. They compromise gastrointestinal integrity, accumulate in the liver and kidneys, dysregulate cardiovascular function, and breach the BBB, resulting in neurological and cognitive impairments. Simultaneously, they impair reproductive capacity, disrupt endocrine systems, and elevate the risk of developmental abnormalities. The implications are transgenerational: the toxic legacy of today’s plastic use may very well manifest in the genetic and reproductive health of future populations. Moreover, this research illustrates how microplastics serve as mobile vectors for pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes, transforming synthetic particles into biological weapons that exploit both ecological and human vulnerabilities.</p><p>In parallel, this study highlights the inadequacy of current regulatory and waste management frameworks, which remain ill-equipped to confront the biochemical and bioethical complexity of this crisis. Critically, the toxicological effects of microplastics are not uniform—they are magnified in marginalized, high-exposure populations, underscoring the socioeconomic inequities embedded in environmental health risks. The burden of microplastic exposure does not fall evenly; it reflects and reinforces global hierarchies of production, consumption, and disposability. This research contributes uniquely by providing a multi-systemic mapping of microplastic toxicity. It moves beyond anecdotal evidence to organize the threat through physiological domains—gastrointestinal, hepatic, cardiovascular, neurological, and reproductive—while incorporating molecular mechanisms such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, immune dysregulation, and endocrine interference. By situating these effects within current literature and critical public health frameworks, the study provides both scientific clarity and ethical urgency. However, gaps persist. There is a paucity of longitudinal human studies. Biomonitoring tools remain rudimentary. Regulatory science has not caught up with the pace of environmental change. In addition, while this study assembles a powerful case for microplastic toxicity, the full extent of its harm remains incalculable—not due to a lack of warning signs, but due to systemic inertia.</p><p>The crisis of microplastic pollution is not merely a scientific problem—it is a failure of foresight, governance, and moral responsibility. It sits at the nexus of industrial excess, consumer complicity, and regulatory indifference. Addressing it demands a convergence of disciplines—environmental science, medicine, toxicology, public policy, and ethics. People need a radical shift—from fragmented mitigation to systemic prevention, from symptomatic treatment to root-cause accountability, and from data generation to legally binding global action. Surveillance of microplastics in the environment and the body must be scaled up. Industry practices must be interrogated, not accommodated. And above all, the human right to a plastic-free biology must be recognized and defended. In sum, this research does not merely warn—it documents a health crisis in motion. The era of plausible deniability is over. Microplastics are here, and they are within and changing us. The only question that remains is whether people will act before the damage becomes irreversible.</p>

      <title>8. Proposed solutions</title>
      <p>The pervasiveness of microplastics in ecosystems and human physiology demands not fragmented, performative gestures, but a comprehensive and enforceable framework for prevention, remediation, and material transition. This section outlines a multi-tiered approach that combines regulatory foresight, technological innovation, and material substitution to meaningfully address the microplastic crisis.</p><p>(a) Regulation and policy implementation</p><p>Implementing stringent, science-based policies to control the production, use, and end-of-life management of plastics is critical. This includes eco-design initiatives, increasing the demand for recycled plastics, and reducing the use of single-use plastics. Over 120 countries have already implemented bans on selected single-use plastics, which is a step towards mitigating plastic pollution. However, enforcement and scope remain inconsistent. Policies must move from symbolic to systemic, targeting industrial-scale producers and packaging monopolies. </p><p>Eco-design mandates: Products should be required to meet environmental design standards that ensure recyclability, minimal material use, and durability. The European Union’s Circular Economy Action Plan provides a useful model, incentivizing producers to shift toward "design for disassembly and reuse."Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR): Holding manufacturers accountable for post-consumer plastic waste ensures upstream accountability. EPR schemes can finance recycling infrastructure and penalize non-compliance.Plastic tax and trade regulation: Introducing tariffs on virgin plastic resins and restricting international plastic waste trade will help internalize environmental costs, making plastic alternatives economically viable.</p><p>Policies must be embedded within transnational legal frameworks, supported by empirical tracking systems and transparent metrics. Global microplastic pollution requires a global governance model—not voluntary pledges but binding, verifiable actions.</p><p>(b) Microbial and nanotechnological remediation: harnessing biology and precision engineering</p><p>Microbial remediation and nanotechnology offer promising solutions for managing plastic waste. These technologies can enhance the biodegradation of microplastics and nanoplastics, reducing their environmental and health impacts. Where plastics have already infiltrated ecosystems, remediation becomes vital. Innovative technologies such as microbial degradation and nanomaterial-based treatment systems offer promising, scalable interventions. </p><p>Microbial remediation: Certain bacteria and fungi have demonstrated the ability to degrade polymers like PET, PE, and PS under controlled conditions. Ideonella sakaiensis, for example, secretes PETase, an enzyme that breaks down PET into benign monomers. Scaling such microbial consortia in waste treatment facilities could reduce environmental microplastic load over time. Nanotechnology: Engineered nanoparticles, especially functionalized metal oxides (e.g., TiO₂ and ZnO), are being developed to adsorb, trap, or catalyze the breakdown of microplastics in aquatic environments. Magnetized nanoparticles are particularly useful in separating plastic fragments from wastewater. Though still in the experimental phase, their integration into water treatment plants could revolutionize post-consumer plastic capture. However, these technologies require rigorous risk assessment to avoid unintended consequences, such as the leaching of toxic byproducts or nanoparticle bioaccumulation. A precautionary but proactive approach is essential.</p><p>(c) Development of sustainable and functional alternatives: material innovation for a post-plastic era</p><p>Perhaps the most transformative solution lies in replacing plastic entirely with biodegradable, non-toxic, and functionally equivalent materials. This is not simply a substitution challenge—it is a call for redefining material culture. </p><p>Bioplastics and bio-based polymers: Materials like polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and starch-based composites offer compostable alternatives. While some bioplastics require industrial composting conditions, ongoing research and development (R&amp;amp;amp;D) is closing the performance gap with synthetic plastics.Cellulose, algae-based, and mycelium packaging: Emerging materials from agricultural waste, algae, and fungal mycelium show promise for replacing single-use plastics, especially in packaging and food services. These materials degrade naturally and pose no known health risks.Silicon-based and glass composite alternatives: In sectors like medical devices and electronics, transitioning to durable, non-shedding materials (e.g., medical-grade silicone or recycled glass) can reduce plastic-derived microfragmentation.</p><p>Transitioning to such alternatives requires market reform, state-backed subsidies, and the dismantling of petrochemical industry monopolies. Public-private partnerships must prioritize life-cycle assessments and cradle-to-cradle product engineering.</p>
