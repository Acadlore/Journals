      <abstract><p>The primary objective of this study encompasses the evaluation of the Padaleunyi Toll Road's service performance, particularly in relation to Indonesia's established minimum service standards for toll roads. Given that the Padaleunyi Toll Road currently stands at mid-life in terms of its service duration, it is crucial to undertake this assessment to predict its remaining useful life. Criteria for measuring minimum service standards' fulfillment were diversified to cover the conditions of the toll road, average vehicular speed, accessibility, mobility, safety parameters, availability of rescue units and service assistance, environmental impact, and features of rest and service areas. The employed research methodology was based on the guidelines provided by Regulation 16/PRT/M/2014 from the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works. Findings indicate a compliance level of 66.04% to the minimum service standards, with the poorest indicator being the condition of the toll roads at a mere 14%. This study hopes to contribute by offering comprehensive insights into the current state and future prospects of the Padaleunyi Toll Road. It further highlights the importance of effective maintenance and operation strategies in prolonging its service life. Overall, the implications of this study can significantly enhance the planning and development process of toll roads, particularly in developing countries such as Indonesia, by incorporating key aspects like pavement quality, road geometric design, and efficient traffic management.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Toll roads serve as fundamental infrastructure, playing a significant role in regional economic growth in Indonesia. It has been observed that cities intersected by toll roads experience an enhanced economic growth rate, approximately 0.015 percent higher than cities devoid of such infrastructure. A shift in industrial locations towards toll gates, primarily to leverage their strategic placement, leads to increased regional revenue via taxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>The condition of such infrastructure directly influences transportation mobility on toll roads, which in turn impacts the efficacy of goods distribution. An efficient distribution network is integral to the production sector, particularly in terms of production costs. Reduced costs typically result in heightened consumer purchasing power, consequently fostering regional progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Public roads that include toll roads are considered a part of the national road network system in Indonesia, and users are mandated to pay the stipulated toll rates. According to Government Regulation No. 15 of 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], the establishment of toll roads aims at promoting balanced and equitable development across regions, enhancing the efficiency of distribution services, and thus bolstering economic growth, especially in areas with high development rates.</p><p>Effective toll road management, reflected through the optimization of provided services, is imperative in enhancing community economic growth. As of June 2022, Indonesia boasts an operational toll road stretch of 2,500 km, distributed across 66 individual toll roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Among these, the Purbaleunyi toll road, one of Indonesia's longest toll roads, serves as a vital connection between the Jakarta Capital Region and the city of Bandung, along with its neighboring areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. A detailed description of the Purbaleunyi toll road is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> reveals a concession period of 54 years for the Purbaleunyi toll road, with the Padaleunyi section operating for 26 years and the Cipularang section for 13 years. Thus, the Padaleunyi section is roughly at mid-concession life, while the Cipularang section is at a quarter of its total life span. The Purbaleunyi Toll Road is among the busiest toll roads, subjected to heavy traffic services and an annually increasing traffic volume. It's observed that the growth rate surpasses the initially projected traffic growth rate.</p><p>An imminent concern pertains to the potential degradation in the performance of the Purbaleunyi toll road, specifically the risk of not fulfilling the intended service period due to damages. A considerable rise in vehicle volume leading to increased road load has resulted in various levels of damage at several toll road locations, ranging from minor to severe, posing potential risks to road users. Reported damage types include cracks, undulations, and potholes of varying depths.</p><p>The growth in vehicle number within Indonesia has a substantial impact on toll road traffic. For instance, the Purbaleunyi Toll Road, due to its high average traffic volume growth per month, is currently Indonesia's highest traffic volume toll road. Consequently, it has a significant effect on the increase in traffic-related accidents, causing serious injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The average monthly traffic volume growth on the Purbaleunyi Toll Road is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

      <p>Indonesia's toll road tariffs have been deemed relatively expensive when compared to other Southeast Asian countries, according to Siswoyo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], thereby demanding a commensurate level of quality. Periodic monitoring and evaluations based on the minimum service standards for toll roads are integral to maintaining the quality and ensuring that the roads remain in an optimal state. It is of importance, considering the yearly increase in vehicle volume, which may accelerate the rate of damage and potentially reduce the road's lifespan.</p><p>Given this situation, it is critical to evaluate the fulfillment of the Minimum Service Standards (SPM) for the Padaleunyi Toll Road. This research focuses specifically on the Padaleunyi Toll Road, taking into account its longer operational history compared to the Cipularang toll road.</p>

          <p>The study design adhered to a descriptive research framework. Evaluations were conducted on the condition of the toll road and equipment associated with the Padaleunyi Toll Road at the Purbaleunyi Branch of the Toll Road Provider. Data collection occurred between April and November 2016 through observation, interviews, and literature review. Observational procedures were conducted in an unrestricted environment, with investigators situated in the field to directly record, measure, and observe without limiting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>Interviews served to determine the toll road's state, where questions regarding the Padaleunyi Toll Road management were posed. Semi-structured interviews were employed, affording both the interviewees and researchers the flexibility to reveal, clarify, and investigate based on the existing facts of the Padaleunyi Toll Road. The secondary data utilized in the literature reviews comprised documents pertinent to the Padaleunyi Toll Road. The data collected are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

Special attention was given to the Padaleunyi section during the data collection process. A comprehensive overview of the data collection methods utilized is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>.</p>

      <p>The damaging weight of the Padaleunyi Toll Road components was used to assess their condition in relation to the toll road minimum service standards. These standards serve as a benchmark for toll road business entities to provide essential services to toll road users (Regulation of the Minister of Public Works and Housing Number 16/PRT/M/2014 Concerning Minimum Service Standards for Toll Roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]). Each criterion within these standards was analyzed to determine its fulfillment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> presents a summary of the percentage of criteria fulfillment for the Padaleunyi section.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> depicts the percentage of criteria fulfillment for the toll road minimum service standards in the Padaleunyi section. Among the eight criteria, only four met the standards in their entirety: average travel speed, mobility, environment, rest, and service area. The criterion with the lowest percentage of standard fulfillment was toll road conditions, meeting only 2 out of the 14 benchmarks. Comparison results with minimum service standards of toll roads for Toll roads condition as can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_11">Table 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_12">Table 12</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_13">Table 13</xref>. Thus, the achievement of minimum service standards for toll road conditions reached a mere 14% of the expected level. Specifically, the only criteria that were met were the roughness and roughness of the main pavement. Conversely, the requirements of having no holes, rutting, and cracks on the main road pavement, as well as proper roadside conditions, were not fulfilled. Furthermore, improvements are needed in all drainage conditions. The median condition, encompassing the curb, median concrete barrier (MCB), guard rail, and wire rope, also fell short of meeting the standards. An example illustrating the presence of cracks and pothole damage on the main road and shoulder pavement is showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>The condition of the main line pavement exhibits variability, with some sections being overlaid and in excellent condition while others could benefit from further enhancement. The road surface has experienced significant wear and tear, despite the application of patches to many areas. Numerous cracks, grooves, longitudinal cracks, and holes are present, with longitudinal cracks being particularly common in the joint area between adjacent pavement layers. According to Wahidin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], both newly built roads and newly restored roads (overlays) experience a decrease in structural function over time. Additionally, damage can occur due to the interaction of friction between vehicles and the road pavement, such as sudden braking at high speeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Such damage weakens the asphalt pavement structure, leading to pavement deformation and the subsequent occurrence of pavement roughness. The presence of pavement roughness negatively impacts vehicle performance and traffic safety.</p>

      <p>Regarding safety criteria, compliance was achieved to a rate of only 64%, ranking second lowest among the evaluated criteria. The criteria for signs, road markings, guide posts, kilometer benchmarks, and hectometer benchmarks were met. However, the criteria for public street lighting, anti-glare measures, right-of-way fences, and safety fences were not fulfilled. Public street lighting on the Padaleunyi Toll Road is limited to a few areas, such as the office, toll booths, and selected turns. Furthermore, some of the installed lights are non-functional and await replacement. This condition renders toll roads vulnerable to security and safety risks, particularly during nighttime travel. The extensive damage to the guard rail, despite its primary function of minimizing collision risks and preventing vehicles from falling from heights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], further exacerbates safety concerns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the absence of a right-of-way fence limiting pedestrian access to the toll road, resulting in the use of this location for picking up and dropping off bus passengers. Such circumstances increase the likelihood of accidents on the highway.</p><p>This research aligns with the findings of study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], emphasizing the critical role of toll road conditions and safety in enhancing overall safety on toll roads. Notably, the Cipularang toll road, included in the Padaleunyi Toll Road sample, stands out as one of Indonesia's most accident-prone toll roads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Consequently, addressing infrastructure damage and ensuring prompt repairs to toll road facilities become essential measures for meeting toll road development criteria. Regular monitoring and evaluation of toll road performance are also necessary to maintain satisfactory operational standards. Given that the Padaleunyi Toll Road has now reached half its planned lifespan, urgent actions are needed to improve toll road conditions, including patching potholes and cracks, to support the safety of toll road users. Additionally, immediate attention should be given to enhancing road markings by rectifying blurred or faded markings. Ensuring the provision of effective rescue and emergency services is of paramount importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The fulfillment of the minimum service standards for the Padaleunyi Toll Road was evaluated, encompassing a measurement of 53 criteria. Out of these criteria, only 35 met the established standards, resulting in a fulfillment rate of 66.04%. It is evident that the physical condition of the toll road requires significant improvement in order to achieve the minimum service standards. This improvement is essential to enhance the comfort, safety, and cost-effectiveness for toll road users, including reduced vehicle operating costs and time savings. Consequently, it is imperative to formulate a prompt corrective action plan to enhance the overall performance of the toll road.</p>
