      <abstract><p>The long-term resilience of classical cryptographic systems has been challenged by recent advances in quantum computing, particularly through algorithms capable of undermining number-theoretic security assumptions. In this context, a simulation-driven comparative evaluation of Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol was conducted to elucidate their respective computational, physical, and practical security characteristics. RSA was assessed using OpenSSL implementations across key sizes ranging from 1024 to 4096 bits, with performance quantified through processing time and CPU utilization under controlled experimental conditions. A 31-fold increase in RSA key generation time was observed when scaling from 1024-bit to 4096-bit keys, although overall performance remained compatible with conventional hardware and existing communication infrastructures. In contrast, BB84 was examined using the Qiskit and NetSquid simulation frameworks to analyze photon transmission distance, channel noise, and Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) dynamics. The results demonstrate that BB84’s security arises from quantum mechanical principles, with QBER increasing linearly as eavesdropping probability was varied. The comparative analysis reveals that RSA continues to provide practical advantages in software compatibility and computational efficiency. Conversely, BB84 offers a quantum-resistant framework suitable for long-term secure communication. These findings suggest that sustainable cryptographic security is most effectively achieved through hybrid architectures that integrate classical and quantum paradigms, enabling near-term operational feasibility while ensuring future-proof protection against quantum adversaries.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The rapidly evolving communication infrastructure of the digital era has rendered information security more critical than ever. Today, the preservation of data integrity, authentication, and confidentiality constitutes a fundamental necessity across a wide range of domains from financial transactions and military communications to the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. For decades, this need for security has been met by classical public-key cryptographic systems, particularly the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. The security of RSA relies on the computational intractability of the integer factorization problem, thereby offering a practically unbreakable foundation of trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. However, the recent advancements in quantum computing have radically challenged this long-standing assumption. Shor’s algorithm, capable of solving the factorization problem in polynomial time, poses a substantial threat to the long-term security of classical asymmetric encryption schemes such as RSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Comparative analyses indicate that classical algorithms like RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography, while efficient on current hardware, become computationally infeasible to secure once quantum computers scale beyond several thousand qubits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>This paradigm shift has directed researchers toward quantum-resistant and quantum-based security approaches. Among the most prominent of these is the BB84 protocol, developed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984. Unlike RSA, BB84 derives its security not from mathematical complexity but from the fundamental physical principles of quantum mechanics. Specifically, through the no-cloning theorem and the measurement-induced disturbance phenomenon, any eavesdropper’s intervention during the key distribution process introduces a measurable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). Consequently, BB84 achieves information-theoretic (unconditional) security, fundamentally distinguishing it from classical cryptographic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. In recent years, several enhanced variants such as decoy-state, measurement-device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and continuous-variable QKD protocols have further improved BB84’s transmission efficiency and robustness.</p><p>A critical review of the existing literature reveals that most comparative analyses between BB84 and RSA have been confined to limited metrics. Prior studies tend to focus primarily on their theoretical security distinctions or mathematical underpinnings, while overlooking multidimensional factors such as performance, hardware requirements, key management, implementation maturity, and cost-effectiveness all of which are vital for contemporary cryptographic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. This gap is particularly significant when considering the design of post-quantum security architectures, where hybrid approaches combining QKD and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) have been increasingly proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to provide a systematic and comprehensive comparison between RSA, representing classical cryptography, and the quantum-based BB84 protocol, focusing on their respective security foundations, computational complexity, hardware demands, and practical applicability. Accordingly, the research is guided by the following questions:</p><p>• Q1: What are the fundamental assumptions underlying the security of the classical RSA algorithm and the BB84 protocol, and to what extent are these assumptions sustainable in the quantum era?</p><p>• Q2: What are the advantages and limitations of both systems in terms of key management, computational load, and operational performance?</p><p>• Q3: How can hybrid or integration-oriented approaches facilitate the transition between classical and quantum cryptography?</p><p>Based on these questions, the study hypothesizes that while the BB84 protocol offers greater resistance to quantum attacks in the long term, RSA maintains practical superiority due to its compatibility with existing infrastructures and lower implementation costs. The novelty of this work lies in its holistic assessment of the two paradigms not only from a theoretical security perspective but also through their practical feasibility, energy and hardware efficiency, quantum channel constraints, and relevance to next-generation network architectures. Furthermore, unlike many prior studies, this research adopts a simulation-based analytical framework, empirically comparing metrics such as RSA’s processing time and CPU utilization with BB84’s key generation rate and QBER levels. In doing so, the study aims to deliver practical insights into the transitional phase between classical and quantum cryptography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>This study is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews prior studies in classical and quantum cryptography. Section 3 details the research methodology and simulation framework. Section 4 presents the experimental results and comparative analyses. Finally, Section 5 discusses the findings, outlines potential directions for future work, and concludes the study.</p>

      <title>2. Related work</title>
      <p>This section provides a comprehensive review of the literature concerning classical public-key cryptographic approaches and quantum-based key-distribution protocols. Existing studies can generally be categorized into four major trends: classical cryptographic methods such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman (DH), quantum cryptographic protocols such as BB84, quantum attack models (including Shor and Grover algorithms), and hybrid QKD–PQC architectures. Systematic reviews indicate that RSA-based public-key systems remain critical from architectural, security, and performance perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Multi-prime RSA variants, for example, aim to increase factorization difficulty but at the cost of higher computational latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Experimental comparisons between classical and quantum protocols reveal that although BB84 offers superior resistance to quantum attacks, it still faces practical hardware constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Collectively, the literature suggests that the computational security of RSA and the physical security of BB84 constitute complementary paradigms within modern cryptography.</p>

            <title>2.1. Classical public-key cryptography approaches</title>
          
          <p>Classical public-key cryptography remains one of the cornerstones of digital-security infrastructures. The most prevalent methods are the RSA and DH protocols. RSA relies on the hardness of integer factorization, whereas DH depends on the computational complexity of the discrete-logarithm problem. Key lengths between 2048 and 4096 bits are still widely deployed. To enhance RSA performance, multi-prime schemes and fast-modular-exponentiation techniques have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], along with extensive evaluations on practical security and optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, Shor’s algorithm, which can solve these mathematical assumptions in polynomial time, fundamentally undermines the long-term security of both RSA and DH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Consequently, recent research has focused on transforming classical infrastructures into quantum-resistant systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p>

            <title>2.2. Quantum cryptography and the bb84 protocol</title>
          
          <p>Quantum cryptography bases its security not on mathematical hardness but on the physical laws of quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol, in particular, is recognized as the first statistically secure key-distribution method capable of detecting eavesdropping through measurement-induced disturbance and the no-cloning theorem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Subsequent variants of BB84 have been developed to mitigate practical vulnerabilities. The decoy-state BB84 scheme enhances source security by preventing multi-photon-emission attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], while the measurement-device-independent QKD architecture eliminates detector side-channel loopholes, enabling end-to-end secure communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Moreover, continuous-variable QKD employs continuous quantum variables to improve error tolerance and transmission robustness under diverse channel conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>Experimental progress has demonstrated secure key-generation rates reaching up to 10 Mb/s over both fiber-optic and free-space channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Integrated photonic-chip technologies further miniaturize QKD systems while offering multi-protocol compatibility and improved energy efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. At the network level, semi-trusted relays and topology-abstraction-based protection schemes have been introduced to enhance the resilience of large-scale QKD infrastructures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Despite these advances, channel attenuation, single-photon-detector efficiency, and hardware cost remain major limitations to widespread deployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, current research is increasingly directed toward hybrid QKD-PQC architectures and low-loss photonic infrastructures to overcome these barriers.</p>

          <p>With the advent of quantum computing, the security of classical cryptographic systems is being fundamentally challenged. Shor's algorithm compromises asymmetric cryptography by factoring large integers and solving discrete-logarithm problems in polynomial time. In contrast, Grover’s algorithm offers a quadratic speedup against symmetric systems; thus, doubling key lengths in protocols such as Advanced Encryption Standard can maintain equivalent security levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. QKD inherently resists these threats, as its security is ensured by the increase in QBER resulting from measurement disturbance rather than computational hardness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. Hence, QKD protocols theoretically provide information-theoretic (unconditional) security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>].</p>

On the network side, semi-trusted relay mechanisms and topology-abstraction techniques further enhance fault tolerance in hybrid QKD networks.

          <p>Comparative studies highlight distinct differences between RSA and BB84 in terms of security foundations, key management, hardware requirements, and technological maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. In summary, RSA offers a mature, low-cost, and widely adopted solution, whereas BB84 provides long-term resilience against quantum adversaries. Although the literature provides extensive analyses of both RSA and BB84, most studies evaluate these protocols independently either through isolated computational benchmarks for RSA or physical-layer performance assessments for BB84. Very few works attempt a unified comparison within a single simulation framework, and existing studies do not jointly consider computational runtimes, physical noise models, secure key-rate behavior, and attack resilience under harmonized conditions. By integrating both protocols into a common experimental environment and applying a consistent set of comparison criteria, this study addresses this gap and provides a more holistic understanding of how classical and quantum systems differ in practical settings.</p><p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> illustrates that while RSA maintains widespread deployment and cost advantages, BB84 offers a quantum-resilient infrastructure for the post-quantum era. Future research directions will likely focus on integrated-photonics-based QKD, hybrid QKD + PQC frameworks, and security-budget models that account for hardware imperfections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>This section presents the methodological framework used to evaluate the RSA and BB84 protocols under a unified simulation-based setting. The approach combines performance measurement, security modeling, and statistical analysis within a consistent experimental structure, enabling both protocols representing classical, complexity-based security and quantum, physics-based security to be analyzed under comparable conditions. By integrating computational experiments for RSA with physical-layer simulations for BB84, the methodology provides a coherent basis for examining the strengths, limitations, and practical feasibility of both cryptographic paradigms.</p>

          <p>The research design adopts a comparative, simulation-based approach. In this context, the RSA protocol, which relies on classical computation, and the BB84 protocol, which is based on quantum physics, were evaluated under predefined common criteria. This study examines two security paradigms grounded in mathematical complexity and physical principles, corresponding to classical and quantum cryptographic systems, respectively, through an integrated quantitative and qualitative analysis framework. This approach is based on the fundamental theoretical framework of the field, including the foundations of practical QKD security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] and the recent advances in quantum cryptography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. The main axes of comparison are grouped under six categories: (1) security foundation; (2) key management; (3) cryptanalytic vulnerability; (4) application domain; (5) hardware requirement; and (6) implementation maturity. These axes correspond exactly to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.

            <title>3.2. Experimental setup and simulation environment</title>
          
          <p>Two separate simulation environments were designed to analyze the performance and behavior of the protocols. The inherent differences between classical and quantum protocols required the use of different toolsets. The simulations were performed for RSA on a 64-bit Windows environment with an Intel i7 (2.6 GHz, 16 GB RAM) processor using Python (v3.11) and the OpenSSL 3.0 library; for BB84, simulations were run using Qiskit (v0.45) and the NetSquid (v1.4.0) quantum network simulators introduced in the NetSquid platform, under both ideal and noisy channel conditions. All experiments were carried out with a fixed randomness seed (seed = 42) to ensure deterministic reproducibility. In the RSA experimental setup, the protocol’s performance metrics were tested for different key lengths. The tested key sizes were determined as<italic> n</italic> = {1024, 2048, 3072, 4096} bits.</p><p>The selection of RSA key lengths follows widely adopted security recommendations. In line with National Institute of Standards and Technology and European Union Agency for Cybersecurity guidelines, 2048-bit keys represent the current minimum level for long-term classical security, while 4096-bit keys correspond to high-assurance configurations used in post-quantum–aware environments. Including 1024-bit keys provides a baseline for legacy systems and allows observing how performance scales with key size. This range therefore reflects both practical deployment and theoretical relevance for comparative analysis. During encryption, the public exponent e (fixed, low Hamming weight) and the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding scheme with Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit were used. With data payloads in the range of 1–16 KB, each test configuration was repeated <italic>N<sub>Test</sub></italic><sub> </sub>= 50 times. Three main metrics were used as measurement components: key-generation time (<italic>T<sub>gen</sub></italic>), encryption time (<italic>T<sub>enc</sub></italic>), and decryption time (<italic>T<sub>dec</sub></italic>).</p><p>Eq. (1) defines the arithmetic mean (<inline-formula>

          <p>Under this configuration, the anticipated results are consistent with established RSA optimization techniques, particularly the application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem as reported in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], which significantly enhances decryption performance for 1024-bit and 4096-bit key sizes. Through the Chinese Remainder Theorem optimization, an average 65% reduction in decryption time was achieved, and the average CPU usage was measured as 7.4% for 1024-bit and 28.1% for 4096-bit. This difference confirms that the computational complexity of RSA increases approximately at the rate of the cube of the key length <italic>O</italic> (<italic>n<sup>3</sup></italic>) .</p><p>The BB84 simulation parameters were selected to match realistic experimental conditions frequently reported in modern QKD implementations. Fiber attenuation values (<inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>0.2 dB/km), detector efficiencies (0.15–0.25), alignment errors (0.5–3%), and dark-count rates fall within the standard performance ranges of commercial and laboratory-grade devices. Similarly, the mean photon number (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mqhufkgfi9">
    <mml:mi>μ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> = 0.4–0.6) and decoy intensities (0.05–0.1) reflect widely used weak-coherent-pulse configurations designed to provide resilience against Photon-Number-Splitting (PNS) attacks. These parameter ranges therefore align with common experimental setups and ensure that the simulation remains representative of practical BB84 systems.</p><p>The parameters are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. BB84 simulation parameters were chosen because they represent the main physical-layer factors that determine the security and operational stability of practical QKD systems.

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> jointly define the QBER, the protocol’s primary security metric. These variables directly correspond to the noise and loss sources modeled in the foundational QKD security analyses, ensuring that the simulation is aligned with real physical constraints. In addition, the inclusion of decoy-state intensities (c) follows the security model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], enabling proper evaluation of resilience against PNS attacks. The pulse rate is used to translate theoretical secure key fractions into practical key generation rates, consistent with the NetSquid-based simulation environment described earlier. Collectively, these parameters provide a comprehensive representation of how optical attenuation, device imperfections, and quantum-channel disturbances affect secure key extraction, ensuring that the resulting simulations reflect experimentally validated BB84 behavior.</p><p>The BB84 experimental setup focused on modeling the protocol's sensitivity to its physical-layer parameters.

            <title>3.3. Security analysis and attack modeling</title>
          
          <p>An important component of the methodology is the modeling of the security resilience of both protocols under different attack vectors. This analysis aims to test the security assumptions upon which the protocols are based against practical and theoretical attacks. The security of RSA fundamentally relies on the computational hardness of the integer factorization problem on classical computers. Breaking a 4096-bit RSA key with conventional methods requires approximately 3 × 10<sup>17</sup> years; however, Shor’s algorithm can reduce this complexity to polynomial time on a sufficiently large quantum computer. This renders RSA potentially vulnerable in future quantum environments. In addition to the threat of quantum algorithms, classical attack vectors also pose significant risks. Grover’s algorithm offers a quadratic speedup on symmetric-key searches, indirectly affecting RSA by increasing the required key lengths for algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard. Furthermore, side-channel attacks including timing differences, power analysis, and cache-based attacks found in open-source cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL—must be considered within the security evaluation. Ensuring constant-time implementations is therefore essential for mitigating such risks.</p><p>In contrast, BB84’s security is rooted in physical principles rather than computational hardness. The primary threat model for BB84 is the Intercept-Resend attack, in which an eavesdropper (<italic>Eve</italic>) manipulates the transmitted quantum states. This attack introduces detectable disturbances by increasing the QBER, typically pushing it toward or above the 25% theoretical limit. This threshold is widely used as the detection benchmark in experimental QKD studies. Beyond Intercept-Resend attacks, BB84 must also mitigate practical vulnerabilities arising from imperfect hardware. For example, PNS attacks exploit multi-photon emissions from weak coherent sources. To counter this, the decoy-state method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>] was employed, providing more accurate estimations of the single-photon yield and error rate parameters. In addition, advanced attacks targeting detection systems, including detector blinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], were considered within the analytical framework.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, this methodology compares RSA and BB84 comprehensively not only in terms of performance but also in their security foundations and hardware requirements. The method reveals that RSA is scalable in terms of processing time within the 1024–4096 bit range but remains weak against quantum threats. On the other hand, BB84 provides information-theoretic security but exhibits higher latency and distance-limited behavior due to its hardware dependencies and channel constraints. This contrast highlights the importance of hybrid systems, such as quantum-assisted classical networks, for the future; however, the scope of this study remains confined to comparative analysis.</p>

      <title>4. Results and discussion</title>
      <p>This section presents a comparative evaluation of the experimental results obtained from the RSA algorithm, representing classical cryptographic systems, and the BB84 protocol, representing quantum-based approaches. The analysis focuses on their differences in terms of security foundations, performance metrics, and intrusion-detection mechanisms. Within this framework, the computational resilience of RSA was assessed through key length, factorization complexity, and authentication requirements, reflecting its dependence on the hardness of mathematical problems. In contrast, BB84 was analyzed through variations in the QBER, channel error probability (<italic>p<sub>Channel</sub></italic>), and eavesdropper detection probability (<italic>p<sub>Eve</sub></italic>), which together characterize the physical integrity of the quantum channel. The results demonstrate that classical systems maintain advantages in computational speed, maturity, and ease of deployment, whereas quantum systems provide superior physical-layer security and inherent eavesdropping detection. Overall, the findings highlight the complementary nature of both paradigms and support the argument that hybrid cryptographic architectures—integrating classical and quantum mechanisms—represent the most sustainable and future-proof direction for next-generation secure communication networks.</p>

            <title>4.1. Rsa side-computation-based security</title>
          
          <p>The RSA experiments were conducted in three stages: performance evaluation, factorization testing, and a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack scenario. In the performance tests, increasing the key length from 1024 bits to 4096 bits resulted in approximately a 31-fold increase in key generation time and an 8–9-fold increase in signing time. In contrast, encryption and verification operations remained within the millisecond range, indicating that RSA remains computationally practical on modern hardware. In the factorization experiment, trial-division methods produced results within milliseconds for key lengths between 16 and 32 bits, whereas the Pollard–Rho algorithm became effective in the 48–80-bit range, with computation times rising to the order of seconds. For 96-bit and larger keys, no valid factorization was achieved within a 15-second timeout. These results demonstrate that factorization time increases rapidly with key size, experimentally confirming the fundamental security assumption of RSA: the practical infeasibility of large-integer factorization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>].</p><p>The complementary MITM experiment further revealed that RSA, in the absence of authentication, is vulnerable to interception. When identity verification was disabled, the adversary (<italic>Eve</italic>) successfully intercepted all session keys (100% success rate); however, when Certificate Authority-signed validation was enabled, all attacks failed. This finding demonstrates that RSA’s security depends not only on key length but also on proper PKI-based authentication mechanisms. The associated computational overhead was minimal, adding only 50–100 ms to the overall connection time, showing that RSA offers strong protection yet remains susceptible to invisible attacks when misconfigured. Consistent with these findings, it has been reported that RSA systems without QKD or hybrid integration remain exposed to MITM-type attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], emphasizing that robust security can only be achieved through explicit public-private key authentication layers.</p>

The fraction of sifted keys resulting from random basis selection was approximately 0.5, confirming the statistical validity of the simulation.

          <p>These outcomes strongly support the BB84 principle that “information cannot be intercepted without disturbance.” As eavesdropper activity increases, QBER rises nearly linearly, causing the system to recognize physical disturbances and automatically terminate secure-key generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, the QBER value reaching 25% when <italic>p<sub>Eve</sub></italic> = 0.4 indicates the operational cutoff beyond which no secure key can be distilled. However, when <italic>p<sub>Channel</sub></italic> <inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> 0.08, the false-alarm rate significantly increases, implying that error-correction and privacy-amplification stages are essential for reliable deployment in real-world systems. Recent studies have proposed entanglement-assisted BB84 variants to enhance the authentication layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], demonstrating that identity verification can also be guaranteed at the physical level. Moreover, the study experimentally validated the practical applicability of BB84 in agricultural and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based monitoring systems, reporting that QBER stability can be maintained despite channel noise and distance-induced attenuation.</p>

          <p>The obtained results reveal that the two paradigms rely on fundamentally distinct yet complementary security principles.</p><p>The fundamental differences between quantum and classical cryptographic approaches are evident in their security principles and performance parameters. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>, the RSA algorithm derives its security from the computational hardness of integer factorization, whereas the BB84 protocol ensures security through the quantum-mechanical principles of measurement disturbance and no-cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. This distinction highlights two contrasting paradigms—RSA relies on mathematical complexity, while BB84 depends on the inviolability of physical laws.</p>

          <p>In terms of performance and scalability, RSA’s software-based architecture enables widespread deployment within existing Internet infrastructures. In contrast, BB84 requires dedicated quantum communication channels, making it inherently limited by transmission distance and optical losses.</p><p>Nevertheless, BB84 offers a distinct advantage in intrusion detection, as eavesdropping can be directly observed through variations in the QBER, providing an effective defense mechanism against stealth attacks such as MITM scenarios. Overall, the comparison demonstrates that while classical systems retain practical advantages in speed and implementation, quantum-based methods exhibit superior long-term resilience and sustainability in security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p>
          <p>When <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> are evaluated together, it becomes evident that the nature of security fundamentally differs between the two paradigms—classical systems rely on computational complexity, whereas quantum systems depend on physical stability. In BB84, the secure threshold is exceeded when <italic>p<sub>Channel</sub> </italic>lies within the range of approximately 0.02–0.03, while in RSA, the absence of authentication enables a MITM attack to succeed completely. This contrast indicates that the highest level of security can be achieved not by using either approach in isolation, but through their hybrid integration. Hybrid RSA–BB84 frameworks provide the most balanced trade-off between performance and attack detection, particularly in IoT and network security scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p>

          <p>In conclusion, the RSA algorithm offers advantages in terms of speed, software compatibility, and integration with existing network infrastructures, whereas the BB84 protocol provides a more sustainable long-term solution through its physics-based security model and high sensitivity to eavesdropping detection. Therefore, RSA is more suitable for high-performance and scalable applications, while BB84 excels in environments demanding maximum security and intrusion awareness. The most secure and future-proof approach lies in the development of hybrid cryptographic architectures that combine the strengths of both systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. Despite the comprehensive scope of this analysis, the study has several limitations. The BB84 simulations are based on idealized channel and noise models that do not fully capture device imperfections, temporal drift, or side-channel effects. Additionally, the comparison focuses exclusively on a single classical algorithm (RSA) and a single quantum protocol (BB84), without evaluating alternative post-quantum cryptographic schemes or QKD variants that may exhibit different performance characteristics. The experiments also do not incorporate large-scale network constraints or hardware-level deployment factors. These limitations frame the scope of the present findings and point to important directions for future research.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study presents a unified simulation-based comparison of RSA and BB84, demonstrating that the two cryptographic paradigms are grounded in fundamentally different security principles and therefore offer distinct advantages. RSA continues to provide strong benefits in terms of computational efficiency, compatibility with existing infrastructures, and operational maturity. However, its dependence on computational hardness exposes it to potential vulnerabilities in the quantum era. BB84, by contrast, offers information-theoretic security through quantum-mechanical properties and enables direct detection of eavesdropping attempts, yet remains constrained by noise sensitivity, hardware imperfections, and deployment complexity. Taken together, the findings reveal that classical and quantum cryptographic systems excel in different domains and that neither, when used in isolation, can fully meet the evolving security needs of future communication networks.</p><p>Building on this foundation, future research can extend the analysis to additional QKD variants, such as decoy-state and entanglement-based protocols, and incorporate more realistic noise models, device imperfections, and side-channel considerations. Expanding the unified simulation framework to larger network scenarios, multi-user environments, and hybrid key-management architectures would provide deeper insight into the scalability and practicality of integrating classical and quantum security mechanisms. Such efforts will be essential for designing resilient and adaptable security infrastructures capable of addressing both current and emerging threats in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
