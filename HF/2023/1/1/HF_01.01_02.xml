      <abstract><p>In the field of computer-aided diagnostics, the segmentation and classification of biomedical images play a pivotal role. This study introduces a novel approach employing a Self-Augmented Multistage Deep Learning Network (SAMNetwork) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) optimized by Coot Optimization Algorithms (COAs) for the analysis of dermoscopy images. The unique challenges posed by dermoscopy images, including complex detection backgrounds and lesion characteristics, necessitate advanced techniques for accurate lesion recognition. Traditional methods have predominantly focused on utilizing larger, more complex models to increase detection accuracy, yet have often neglected the significant intraclass variability and inter-class similarity of lesion traits. This oversight has led to challenges in algorithmic application to larger models. The current research addresses these limitations by leveraging SAM, which, although not yielding immediate high-quality segmentation for medical image data, provides valuable masks, features, and stability scores for developing and training enhanced medical images. Subsequently, DBNs, aided by COAs to fine-tune their hyper-parameters, perform the classification task. The effectiveness of this methodology was assessed through comprehensive experimental comparisons and feature visualization analyses. The results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach over the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods across three datasets: ISBI 2017, ISBI 2018, and the PH2 dataset. In the experimental evaluations, the Multi-class Dilated D-Net (MD2N) model achieved a Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.86201, the Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) model 0.84111, the standalone DBN 0.91157, the autoencoder (AE) model 0.88662, and the DBN-COA model 0.93291, respectively. These findings highlight the enhanced performance and potential of integrating SAM with optimized DBNs in the detection and classification of skin cancer in dermoscopy images, marking a significant advancement in the field of medical image analysis.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Skin cancer, particularly its melanoma and non-melanoma forms, stands as a prevalent health concern compared to other cancer types. Melanoma, characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of pigmented cells (melanocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), has been observed to increasingly contribute to mortality rates annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Razmjooy et al., 2020</xref>). This upward trend in melanoma incidences poses a significant public health risk, underlining the necessity of early detection measures. It is well-established that early-stage melanoma can be effectively treated, thereby rendering early detection methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Daghrir et al., 2020</xref>) increasingly vital. In the realm of melanoma skin cancer imaging, distinguishing lesioned from non-lesioned areas presents a formidable challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Jakkulla et al., 2023</xref>), often necessitating specialized expertise. Consequently, divergent opinions among dermatologists are not uncommon. In response to this, an automated analysis method has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Dildar et al., 2021</xref>), aiming to facilitate rapid and accurate diagnostic decisions by dermatologists. Central to this automated analysis is the requirement for precise segmentation of the skin surrounding melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ali et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p style="text-align: justify">Recent technological advancements have heralded the widespread adoption of deep neural networks in computer vision tasks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, known for their adept feature extraction and classification capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Macherla et al., 2023</xref>), have gained prominence in pattern recognition and segmentation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). In line with this, a number of studies have focused on the segmentation and classification of skin lesions, employing pre-trained CNN models augmented with transfer learning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). Advanced deep learning methodologies, including UNet, Mask R-CNN, fully convolutional networks, feature pyramid networks, SegNet, and transformers, have been utilized to identify critical lesion locations at the pixel level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Ali et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Pacheco &amp;amp; Krohling, 2020</xref>).</p><p style="text-align: justify">Building on the foundation of these prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Toğaçar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Thomas et al., 2021</xref>), which predominantly revolve around lesion segmentation and classification in dermoscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), the current research introduces a multi-task learning network aimed at improving the segmentation and classification of skin lesions as melanoma. This network employs pre-processing techniques during segmentation, initially enhancing image clarity and removing hair details. Subsequently, SAMNet is utilized for lesion segmentation, followed by the application of a very deep super-resolution neural network to extract and enhance the quality of the segmented lesions. These high-resolution images then serve as inputs for the classifier model. The classifier model itself is a novel amalgamation of three robust, pre-trained deep models. Both the ISIC database and PH2 have been utilized to rigorously test each proposed method. Experimental results validate the superior performance of the developed classification system.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The advantages of the proposed deep network method are manifold:</p><p><p style="text-align: justify">A very deep super-resolution neural network enhances the resolution of lesion images, refining them post-segmentation for input into the classifier model.</p><p style="text-align: justify">A SAMNetwork approach effectively localizes lesions in a diverse range of dermoscopy images, as evidenced by numerical and visual results from experimental tests.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The classifier model's design, based on an integration of diverse deep models, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in melanoma classification, as verified through experimental studies.</p></p><p style="text-align: justify">The study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review, Section 3 describes the proposed model, Section 4 details the experimental analysis, and Section 5 offers the conclusion.</p>

This approach incorporates preprocessing, segmenting the cancer regions, and Fast Adaptive Moth-Flame optimization with Cauchy mutation (FA-MFC) for data dimensionality reduction. The bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU)-quantum neural network (QNN) facilitates multi-class classification, while hidden features are extracted via the structural similarity with light U-structure (USSL). Tested on the Kaggle and ISIC-2019 datasets, this model demonstrated remarkable accuracy, achieving up to 96.458% on Kaggle and 94.238% on ISIC-2019.

Their approach utilized U-Net for segmenting skin diseases in scans and introduced a convolutional model for multi-class classification of segmented images. The model was tested on the HAM10000 dataset, encompassing images across seven skin disease categories. Employing Adam and Adadelta optimizers for 20 epochs and a batch size of 32, the model demonstrated superior performance, especially with an Adadelta optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 97.96%.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Kumar et al.

By utilizing dilated manifold parallel convolution, the network's receptive field is expanded, addressing the "grid issue" common in standard dilated convolutions. This approach enables the model to capture detailed feature information from regions with variably sized skin lesions. The system, powered by the proposed deep learning model, efficiently segments and identifies lesion locations from skin images provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Singh et al. (2023)</xref> advocated for a modified deep learning model coupled with fuzzy logic-based image segmentation for skin cancer diagnosis. This model incorporates dermoscopy image enhancement techniques, including standard deviation methods, L-R fuzzy defuzzification, and mathematical logic infusion, aimed at augmenting lesion visibility by eliminating distractive artifacts such as hair follicles and dermoscopic scales. Following segmentation, the quality of the image is enhanced through histogram equalization before proceeding to detection. The modified model employs the You Look Only Once (YOLO) deep neural network approach for diagnosing melanoma lesions from digital and dermoscopic images. Enhancements to the YOLO model include an additional convolutional layer and residual connections within its DCNN layer sequence, alongside feature concatenation across layers. Training on 2,000 and 8,695 dermoscopy images from the ISIC 2017 and ISIC 2018 datasets, with the PH2 dataset for testing, revealed that YOLO surpasses other classifiers in accuracy and speed.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Sethanan et al.

The SC-CS combines image segmentation and CNN algorithms, optimizing the weighting of findings for high-quality outcomes. Evaluated using accuracy, precision, Area Under Curve (AUC), and F1-score metrics, along with feedback from 31 specialists, including dermatologists and physicians experienced in skin cancer diagnosis, the SC-CS demonstrated remarkable accuracy on the HAM10000 and malignant vs. benign datasets. With an accuracy exceeding 99.4%, it outperformed state-of-the-art models by 2.1% for larger sizes and 15.7% for smaller sizes. The System Usability Scale (SUS) of 96.85% indicates high user satisfaction and likelihood of recommendation.

Moreover, the model adeptly handles the challenge of incorrectly segmented small areas in the grab cut technique. The importance of data augmentation in training and testing was underscored, with the model showing enhanced results compared to using new images alone. In various trials against other transfer models, this proposed model excelled, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.986% for skin lesion classification.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Hong et al.

This method leverages the abundance of labeled data at the image level for fine-tuning, focusing on lesion areas. The process involves training a repurposed CNN classifier and back-propagating the top layer’s peak values, followed by over-segmenting a test image into superpixels, which are then aggregated into region proposals. Lesion region responses are then identified via non-maximal suppression, leading to the selection of a segmented mask. Quantitative tests on the ISBI2017 and PH2 datasets demonstrated that the CNN-SRR method not only effectively discriminates lesion locations but also achieves competitive accuracy comparable to supervised segmentation algorithms. Specifically, on the ISBI2017 dataset, the CNN-SRR method outperformed the unsupervised superpixel segmentation algorithm by 12.4% on the Jaccard coefficient and 3.3% on segmentation accuracy.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alenezi et al.

The approach begins with an efficient pre-processing strategy, employing max pooling, contrast, and shape filters to remove hair details and enhance images. These processed images are then segmented using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layer architecture based on a Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) model. Following segmentation, lesions are cropped and subjected to a very deep super-resolution neural network, aiming to adjust the cropped images to the classifier model's input size with minimal loss of detail. A deep learning network strategy, utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural networks, was then deployed for melanoma classification. Experiments conducted using the International available dermoscopy skin lesion dataset demonstrated impressive results. For lesion region segmentation, the method achieved 96.99% accuracy, 92.53% specificity, 97.65% precision, and 98.41% sensitivity. In classification tasks, it yielded 97.73% accuracy, 99.83% specificity, 99.83% precision, and 95.67% sensitivity.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">In the preprocessing stage, the primary objective was to enhance the quality of dermoscopic images and reduce noise in skin lesion images. This phase is critical for developing an effective skin lesion segmentation and classification model. The initial step involved applying a hair removal technique to the lesion area, followed by an intensity-based image quality enhancement process on the hairless dermoscopy images. This two-stage preparation was essential for accurately isolating the region of interest (ROI) in the images.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The hair removal process, executed using morphological operations, targeted the precise identification of the ROI. Post hair removal, an intensity-based picture quality enhancement was performed, aimed at improving the pixel quality of the now hairless dermoscopic images.

In addition to the segmentation prior map, a boundary prior map was also generated based on the external borders of each mask from the list.

              <p style="text-align: justify">Post-creation of the prior maps, these were employed to augment the input image <italic>x</italic>. The augmentation method chosen for this study involved adding the prior maps directly to the raw image. Medical image segmentation tasks often entail a three-class segmentation job: the background, ROIs, and boundaries between ROIs and the background. In the augmented image, the segmentation prior map was superimposed on the second channel, while the boundary prior map was placed on the third. For grayscale images, a three-channel image was constructed with the raw image, segmentation prior map, and boundary prior map as the first, second, and third channels, respectively. This process resulted in an augmented version <italic>x<sub>aug</sub> = Aug(prior<sub>seg</sub>, prior<sub>boundary</sub>, x)</italic> of each image <italic>x</italic> in the training set.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify">The self-attention mechanism is an integral component of deep neural networks, notably in Transformer models, which have extended their applications beyond natural language processing to include computer vision. SAM is pivotal in capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information within images, especially for image segmentation tasks. It serves as an alternative to convolutional layers, effectively capturing spatial relationships between pixels or regions. The central element of SAM is the computation of attention weights, signifying the significance of various regions or pixels relative to a query. These weights are calculated using a similarity function, typically the dot product, between the query and key for all query-key pairs, followed by the application of a softmax function to yield the attention weights.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Once attention weights are determined, they are utilized to aggregate information from the values, proportionally to the relevance of each region to the query.</p><p style="text-align: justify">With the augmented training set <inline-formula>

          <p style="text-align: justify">The implementation of DBNs in the proposed skin cancer detection system leverages recent advances in deep learning. DBNs, an energy-based model for generating probabilities, are constructed by stacking multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The DBN model operates in two phases: training and testing. In the training phase, the DBN layers are trained utilizing a series of RBM layers. These layers comprise neurons located in the hidden layer, situated above the input layer. Neurons between different layers communicate freely, whereas intra-layer communication is restricted. The architecture of the surrounding visible layer is represented as follows:</p>

This process continues until the parameter values have been adjusted to yield a feature representation that is more abstract and representable than that produced by the lower layer. The DBN model utilized these equations for efficient feature extraction. The training method of the coot optimization process allows the proposed detection model to bypass specialized capabilities, producing a more sophisticated set of features overall, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the detection system.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">The experimental studies were conducted on a system equipped with an Intel(R) Core (TM) i5-7200u processor, ranging from 2.50 to 2.7 GHz, complemented by 16 GB RAM and an 8 GB graphics card, utilizing MATLAB 2020b.</p>

            <title>4.1. Segmentation analysis</title>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify">In evaluating the segmentation performance, metrics such as accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPE), and sensitivity (SEN), alongside the Jaccard and Dice similarity coefficients (JSC and DSC, respectively), were employed. These metrics are pivotal in assessing the effectiveness of the segmentation method. The true positive (TP) rate was determined by identifying the overlapping area between the segmented region and the ground truth, denoted as <italic>y</italic> and <italic>x</italic>, respectively. This intersection is represented mathematically as <italic>TP = yx</italic>. Conversely, the false positive (FP) rate was defined as <italic>FP = yx</italic>, which represents the segmented region in <italic>x</italic> not corresponding to <italic>y</italic>. The false negative (FN) rate, indicating the proportion of incorrect predictions, was calculated as <italic>FN = yx</italic>. The true negative (TN) set, representing the complement of the segmented and ground truth regions, is described as <inline-formula>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p style="text-align: justify">This research has successfully developed a lesion detection model based on dermoscopy images, integrating a pre-trained lightweight network for feature extraction. A novel augmentation approach, SAMAug, was introduced, enhancing medical image segmentation by leveraging the SAM to augment the inputs for established medical image segmentation models. The efficacy of this innovative strategy was empirically validated across three distinct segmentation tasks. In the classification phase, DBNs were employed, with the COA optimizing the selection of DBN weights. The proposed model's performance was rigorously tested and validated using three datasets, evaluated against a comprehensive set of metrics.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Looking ahead, the exploration of a more advanced and sophisticated augmentation function warrants consideration. Future research will focus on identifying and analyzing the variables and factors influencing the performance of the proposed method. Additionally, the transformer architecture within this context will be scrutinized, with necessary modifications to the proposed method being contemplated. Another critical avenue for future work lies in the collection and curation of larger and more diverse datasets of dermoscopy images. The development of a substantial dataset is imperative for enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. Collaborative efforts in creating annotated datasets will prove immensely beneficial for the research community, facilitating advancements in the field of medical image analysis.</p>
