      <abstract><p>The assessment of driving behavior, vital for ensuring passenger safety and optimizing resource utilization in transportation systems, faces challenges due to inherent unpredictability and complexity. This study addresses these challenges by introducing innovative methodologies for the extraction, classification, and prediction of diverse driving patterns, utilizing data from "On Board Diagnostics" (OBD) ports in modern vehicles. In this approach, a comprehensive suite of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) stechniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Optimized Spectral Neural Classification (OSNCA), and Fuzzy Logical Feature Selection (FLFS), are employed. These techniques are instrumental in overcoming limitations of previous models, enhancing accuracy in driving behavior evaluation. The utilization of FLFS in conjunction with OSNCA represents a novel method in driver behavior analysis. By applying these techniques, driver characteristics and behaviors are systematically categorized into distinct classes, facilitating a nuanced understanding of driving dynamics. The integration of these advanced methodologies not only furthers the analysis of driver behavior but also significantly improves classification and prediction capabilities.

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The propensity of young drivers towards risky driving behaviors has been extensively studied. However, the intersection between driving competence, temporal orientation, and driving behavior remains under-explored, despite the significant role of time perspective as a predictor of various risky behaviors. Time perspective encompasses a comprehensive concept involving attitudes related to the past, present, and future. Specifically, (a) the past time perspective relates to the recollection of reconstructed past experiences; (b) the present time perspective involves attention to immediate and salient stimuli; and (c) the future time perspective pertains to the anticipation and projection of future occurrences.</p>

            <title>1.1. Analysis of driver behavior</title>
          
          <p>In the realms of behavioral modeling, auto insurance, and government-managed public transportation systems, understanding driver behavior is crucial. This understanding is of paramount importance to the automobile and intelligent transportation sectors, which seek innovative solutions for enhancing task performance. In this context, various technologies are being employed to analyze driver behavior, including assessment of driving skills, monitoring the physical state of drivers through facial recognition and physiological feature tracking, and leveraging in-vehicle telematics for real-time data collection and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Zinebi et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

            <title>1.2. Techniques in driving monitoring systems</title>
          
          <p>The classification of driver behavior, acknowledged as a complex subject, involves multiple factors encompassing driving and traffic conditions. It is recognized that variable traffic conditions such as road environments, vehicle motion, and driver conduct are intertwined. These variables are instrumental in the development of fuzzy sets, which enhance the understanding of diverse driving styles and conditions. Accordingly, it is imperative to integrate operations and tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Shi et al., 2015</xref>) to accurately assess driver behavior.</p><p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, the initial module of the driving monitoring system primarily focuses on the driver's background information. This module considers various attributes, such as gender, age, driving experience, educational background, employment status, income level, average annual mileage, instances of traffic law violations, and accident history in the previous year. Utilizing statistical learning models, these data points are analyzed to establish correlations between the driver's background and the probability of accident involvement. By applying these models, predictions regarding a driver's likelihood of causing a traffic accident can be formulated. The background data is systematically evaluated against specific criteria, resulting in a comprehensive driver risk assessment score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Xing et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

          <p>In the endeavor to ascertain driver identity and driving style, a multifaceted array of factors must be evaluated. These encompass vehicle and road conditions, the driver's biological and physiological state, incident classification and identification, along with environmental influences. Despite the complexity, recent advancements in commercial and research-based systems over the past decade have significantly contributed to the analysis of driving behavior. The current paradigm in these systems focuses on assessing driving performance and offering driver assistance, sharing a unified infrastructure to monitor diverse driving systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Alluhaibi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study is to enhance the analysis of driver behavioral data by implementing a novel classification and prediction framework. This methodology is designed to enable precise categorization of data into distinct classes, thereby markedly improving the accuracy in predicting driver behavior patterns. Employing fuzzy logic for feature selection, this approach refines the analysis of driver behavioral characteristics, yielding superior classification precision. Furthermore, the methodology utilizes relative closeness data in its intentional pattern prediction, thereby augmenting the precision of behavioral pattern predictions. This is achieved by conducting an exhaustive analysis of driver data, which underpins the enhanced prediction accuracy.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The analysis of driving behavior is acknowledged as a multifaceted concept, typically characterized by the adaptation of vehicle control to external conditions and the driving environment. Research has consistently shown that a majority of vehicular accidents are attributable to improper driving behaviors, thereby underscoring the critical need for accurate accident prevention characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In the realm of big data, algorithms designed to analyze vehicle motion have gained prominence. These algorithms play a pivotal role, as the driving styles they discern are instrumental in providing insights that can significantly reduce traffic accident risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Hssayeni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Peng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Studies investigating the causative factors of traffic accidents have revealed that human error is predominantly responsible. Drivers, as the primary operators of vehicles, are often implicated in these incidents. Consequently, there is an imperative need to scrutinize the elements influencing driver behavior and to develop targeted corrective strategies for mitigating negative driving behaviors. This approach is particularly vital in the interim phase leading up to the full implementation of autonomous driving. Moreover, this line of inquiry provides foundational support for the study of humanoid behaviors in the context of autonomous driving technologies.</p><p>It has been established through various studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Hua &amp;amp; Cheng, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Kroenung &amp;amp; Eckhardt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Mayhew et al., 2003</xref>) that on-road experience is a crucial factor in enhancing hazard mitigation skills and reducing instances of distracted driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Reason et al., 1990</xref>). Evidence suggests that experienced drivers, in contrast to their novice counterparts, exhibit a lower risk of crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Martinussen et al., 2013</xref>), attributed to their ability to efficiently allocate attentional resources for hazard recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Tao et al., 2017</xref>). Novice drivers, lacking in maturity and experience, are more prone to be involved in traffic accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Guo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite structured driving exercises during the learning phase, Pnina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Özkan et al., 2006</xref>) highlighted the high incidence of errors during early license holding periods. Limited experience is a contributing factor to a driver’s reduced ability to recognize potential road hazards, leading to increased risks of rear-end collisions and impaired driving incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Curry et al., 2017</xref>). Experienced drivers display greater proactivity and superior situational awareness when encountering on-road challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Van Gelderen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The deviation from standard driving behaviors is considered an indicator of potential danger, leading to the use of driving performance metrics to study the impact of drivers’ behavioral traits on their driving quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Caponecchia &amp;amp; Williamson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Choudhary &amp;amp; Velaga, 2019</xref>). Anomalies such as frequent critical braking or rapid acceleration are often linked with risky driving behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alrassy et al., 2023</xref>). This study focuses on employing driving performance metrics derived from continuous driving profiles gathered from field data, aiming to enhance the detection of risky driving patterns. The significant contribution of this research lies in identifying unsafe driving behaviors through the analysis of continuous driving profiles collected via in-car data recording devices.</p><p>In summary, inexperienced drivers present a considerable risk to themselves, other road users, and passengers. A driver’s experience is intricately linked with psychological attributes such as awareness, confidence, and attitude, as well as emergency response capabilities and peripheral monitoring skills.</p>

      <p>The acquisition of live vehicle data constituted a critical component of this research, with a dataset obtained in a CSV format for comprehensive analysis. The dataset comprised data collected from the IGNIS Soul vehicle, operated by twenty diverse drivers during a consistent road trip spanning 150 km (round-trip) and encompassing approximately 40 hours of driving.</p><p>It is pertinent to highlight that the dataset encapsulated driving conditions across varied road types, such as urban, rural, and highway terrains. This variety in road settings is crucial, given its potential influence on driver behavior.</p><p>Parameters included in the dataset were extensive, covering aspects crucial to the study such as fuel consumption, vehicle dynamics, road conditions, and maintenance indicators. Engine-related parameters like engine speed, torque, and coolant temperature were also incorporated. Furthermore, the dataset was enriched with features encompassing accelerator pedal percentage, throttle position, and various metrics of the electrical system.</p><p>For the purpose of data analysis, visual inspection techniques, including scatter plots and box plots, were utilized to examine variable distributions and identify anomalies. Additionally, a rigorous outlier detection procedure, grounded in established statistical methodologies, was implemented to address aberrant data points, thereby safeguarding the dataset's integrity.</p><p>This detailed and varied dataset forms the bedrock of the research, enabling an in-depth examination of vehicle performance and driver behavior under different driving conditions.</p>

      <title>5. Result and discussion</title>
      <p>The performance of drivers, monitored over various time frames, is established based on a driver performance pattern. This pattern is predicated on parameters such as signal state, fuel consumption, speed, acceleration, and traffic assumptions. The approach generates various methods for class performance evaluation based on the features supplied. Similarly, the system quantifies neuronal activation using the Performance Aspect Ratio (PAR), rated in several class formats. The PAR value is instrumental in determining the driver class, with recurrent neural activation applied across all training features in the hidden layer for classification.</p><p>For comprehensive assessment, the FLFS-OSNC approach's baseline technique selection is crucial for comparative analysis. Each baseline technique, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), and Genetic Algorithm-based Fuzzy C-Means (GA-FCM), is carefully chosen for its applicability to driver behavior analysis. Previously, these methods were utilized in predicting driving behaviors, highlighting areas for enhancement. The IGNIS dataset serves as a trial model set to establish the efficacy of FLFS-OSNC. The results presented in this study provide a foundation for broader spectrum analysis in future research. SVM is employed as a standard benchmark to evaluate the performance of FLFS-OSNC. PCA is used to compare how FLFS-OSNC captures feature significance against a dimensionality reduction-centered method. HDP's inclusion addresses the temporal dependencies in driver behavior analysis, offering insights into sequential data modeling. GA-FCM provides a benchmark against methods that leverage evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy clustering. This study ensures a thorough evaluation of the dataset, allowing for comparisons against traditional, contemporary, and specialized approaches. The rationale for each selection underscores the necessity to comprehend FLFS-OSNC's effectiveness and uniqueness in predicting driver behavior patterns. The capabilities of FLFS-OSNC not only enhance current systems but also offer tailored interventions attuned to specific contexts. Moreover, the predictive and context-aware capabilities of FLFS-OSNC have potential applications beyond driving behavior analysis, including sectors like finance, retail, manufacturing, education, security, and customer service.</p><p>In the context of driver behavior analysis, the proposed personalized web search method utilizes feature selection and spectral classification to infer relevant categories based on the retrieval history of driver behavior searches. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in context clustering, with hybrid data patterning (HDP) showing improved performance over previous methodologies.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The implementation of the FLFS-OSNC method in this research has demonstrated its efficacy in predicting driver behavioral patterns and providing optimal recommendations to enhance driving behaviors. A robust system for driver behavior analysis has been established through the integration of feature selection and classification approaches within the proposed methodology.</p><p>In comparison with advanced techniques such as SVM, PCA, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDL), and GA-FCM, the FLFS-OSNC approach has exhibited superior performance. It achieved an accuracy of 98.9%, a precision of 88.3%, and a recall of 93.9%. These metrics underscore the method's ability to minimize classification errors and reduce time complexity, especially in the context of large-dimensional datasets.</p><p>However, it is imperative to acknowledge that the current iteration of the method is limited in providing driving patterns during risky situations. Future research efforts will be directed towards expanding the methodology to include real-time driving behavior features and analyzing trends during hazardous scenarios. This research thus sets a strong foundation for furthering the field of driver behavior prediction and analysis.</p><p>The integration of the FLFS-OSNC method with existing driver assistance systems has the potential to facilitate the swift processing of real-time data, effectively addressing communication delays and ensuring synchronization with current components. This integration, however, introduces complexities in the management of riskier driving patterns. These complexities encompass challenges in defining and identifying risks, navigating ethical considerations, garnering driver acceptance, and adhering to the dynamic legal and regulatory frameworks. The successful implementation of FLFS-OSNC has demonstrated its proficiency in predicting driving behaviors, thereby enabling improvements in various aspects such as vehicle dynamics, fuel consumption, and maintenance of key components like clutches and brake shoes. This contributes to an overall enhancement in engine and vehicle performance.</p><p>Nevertheless, integrating the FLFS-OSNC approach with driver assistance systems presents both potential benefits and challenges. Key challenges may arise in terms of data processing speed and latency, necessitating a careful evaluation of system responsiveness. It is imperative to balance these aspects to ensure successful integration, which could significantly augment the efficacy of driver assistance systems and contribute to advancements in road safety.</p>
