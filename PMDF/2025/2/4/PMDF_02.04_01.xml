      <abstract><p>3D printing provides an effective digital fabrication route for manufacturing structured adsorbents with customized geometries, offering clear advantages in permeability, recoverability, and structural integration for water treatment applications. However, a fundamental challenge remains: high porosity, which is essential for mass transfer and adsorption capacity, often compromises mechanical robustness, thereby limiting structural stability, recyclability, and service life under dynamic operating conditions. Most existing studies address this trade-off through incremental optimization within individual material systems, resulting in limited performance improvement. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in 3D-printed structured adsorbents by taking adsorption mechanisms as the central framework. Strategies for enhancing mass transfer through hierarchical pore architecture are reviewed alongside a critical analysis of chemical durability and mechanically governed structural stability, which are key factors for engineering reliability. Emerging fabrication approaches, including core-shell printing and multi-material co-extrusion, are discussed as promising routes to decouple adsorption functionality from load-bearing structures, enabling the concurrent improvement of adsorption performance and mechanical integrity. In addition, challenges related to performance evaluation, dynamic adsorption testing, and cost-benefit considerations are examined, providing guidance for the transition from material-level printing toward structurally reliable adsorption device design.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The global challenge of water pollution has intensified in recent decades, exerting profound and long-lasting impacts on ecological systems, public health, and socioeconomic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Rapid industrialization, urban expansion, and agricultural intensification have resulted in the continuous discharge of domestic sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial effluents into natural water bodies, accelerating the degradation of freshwater ecosystems. In many regions, the effectiveness of water pollution control is further constrained by insufficient monitoring data, fragmented management systems, and a severe shortage of financial resources dedicated to treatment infrastructure and technological upgrades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. In addition to conventional pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals, water environments are increasingly burdened by a diverse range of emerging organic pollutants, characterized by high persistence, strong concealment, and complex chemical structures that complicate detection and remediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. As a result, heavy metals, dyes, and emerging contaminants continue to demand sustained attention due to their toxicity, bioaccumulation potential, and resistance to conventional treatment processes.</p><p>To mitigate these challenges, a variety of water treatment technologies have been developed and applied, including coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], catalytic oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], membrane separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], biological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], and adsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Among these approaches, adsorption has attracted enduring interest owing to its operational simplicity, high removal efficiency, adaptability to diverse pollutants, and suitability for both centralized and decentralized treatment scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Adsorption processes rely on porous solid materials to capture contaminants through surface interactions, making the physicochemical properties and structural configuration of adsorbents decisive factors in treatment performance. Nevertheless, conventional adsorbents frequently suffer from intrinsic limitations, such as poor selectivity, particle agglomeration in powdered forms, difficulties in post-treatment recovery, risks of secondary pollution, insufficient permeability in bulk configurations, low utilization efficiency of active sites, and limited regenerability.</p><p>In response to these limitations, current research efforts have increasingly focused on the construction of 3D structured adsorbents, the development of novel adsorption materials, and the modification of traditional adsorbent systems. Within this context, 3D printing—also referred to as additive manufacturing—has emerged as a disruptive digital fabrication technology with the capability to reshape the design and manufacturing paradigm of functional adsorption devices. Since its introduction in the late twentieth century, 3D printing has been widely adopted across multiple industrial sectors due to its inherent advantages in geometric freedom, design flexibility, rapid prototyping, and on-demand customization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. By enabling layer-by-layer fabrication guided by computer-aided design, 3D printing facilitates the precise control of macroscopic geometry and internal architecture, offering a viable route to overcome the manufacturing constraints associated with conventional techniques such as templating, foaming, casting, and self-assembly.</p><p>From a manufacturing perspective, 3D printing provides unique opportunities to integrate adsorption functionality with structural design, thereby addressing long-standing challenges related to mass transfer efficiency, hydraulic permeability, and mechanical stability. Certain printing techniques allow the incorporation of advanced adsorption materials without altering their intrinsic properties, while most additive manufacturing processes are compatible with subsequent chemical modification or surface functionalization. Consequently, 3D printing has been increasingly recognized as an enabling platform for the fabrication of structured adsorbents tailored for water treatment applications. Although the application of 3D printing in this field remains at an early stage, publication trends indicate rapid growth and expanding research interest (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Previous review studies have examined the use of 3D printing in water pollution control from broad perspectives, encompassing 3D-printed membranes and membrane supports, catalytic reactors, biological carriers, and structured adsorbents, including fixed-bed adsorption systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Other reviews have focused on specific material classes and their integration with 3D printing, reporting advances across multiple application domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. However, existing reviews generally provide limited and fragmented coverage of 3D-printed adsorption systems. Most emphasize maximum adsorption capacity as the primary performance indicator, while offering insufficient analysis of hierarchical pore architecture design, chemically and mechanically governed stability, and dynamic adsorption behavior—factors that are critical for long-term operation and engineering feasibility.</p><p>Against this background, the present review aims to systematically summarize recent progress in the fabrication of structured adsorbents for water treatment using diverse 3D printing technologies, with adsorption mechanisms serving as the central organizing framework. Emphasis is placed on elucidating how synergistic macro–micro structural design influences mass transfer pathways and adsorption kinetics, as well as on critically examining the chemical durability and mechanical robustness that dictate recyclability and service reliability. Furthermore, key challenges such as ambiguous performance comparison standards, inadequate evaluation of dynamic adsorption processes, and the lack of comprehensive cost-benefit analysis are discussed. By bridging concepts from precision manufacturing, structural mechanics, and functional materials engineering, this review seeks to provide guidance for advancing 3D-printed adsorbents from exploratory material printing toward mechanically reliable, application-oriented, and digitally manufactured adsorption devices.</p>

      <title>2. Digital fabrication technologies for manufacturing structured adsorbents</title>
      <p>According to the classification system established by the ISO, additive manufacturing technologies can be categorized into seven principal types: powder bed fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], binder jetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], directed energy deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], material jetting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], material extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], sheet lamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], and vat photopolymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. Each category is characterized by distinct material feedstocks, energy delivery mechanisms, and consolidation principles, which collectively determine the achievable geometric precision, internal architecture, and mechanical integrity of printed components.</p><p>Among these technologies, material extrusion and vat photopolymerization have emerged as the most mature and widely adopted approaches for the fabrication of 3D structured adsorbents. Their dominance arises from a favorable balance between material compatibility, process controllability, and structural design freedom. In addition, selective laser sintering (SLS), a representative powder bed fusion technique, has recently attracted preliminary attention due to its ability to fabricate self-supporting porous structures with inherently high mechanical strength. Although the application scope of SLS in adsorbent preparation remains limited at present, its potential for producing mechanically robust adsorption frameworks warrants further exploration. Collectively, these technologies provide complementary manufacturing routes for constructing structured adsorbents with tailored pore architectures and functional performance, making them particularly relevant to precision manufacturing-oriented adsorption device design.</p>

            <title>2.1. Material extrusion technology</title>
          
          <p>Material extrusion technologies, primarily including fused deposition modeling (FDM) and direct ink writing (DIW), fabricate 3D objects through the continuous extrusion of thermally softened materials or viscoelastic slurries, followed by layer-by-layer deposition and solidification. Owing to their operational simplicity, scalability, and broad material adaptability, material extrusion techniques currently represent the most extensively explored category for the preparation of 3D-printed adsorbents.</p><p>FDM operates by heating thermoplastic polymers to a semi-molten state and extruding them through a nozzle to construct predefined geometries via successive layer stacking. Due to its low equipment cost, high process stability, and ease of implementation, FDM is among the most mature and widely utilized additive manufacturing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. However, the thermoplastic materials commonly employed in FDM, such as polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene, and polyamide (PA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], generally exhibit negligible intrinsic adsorption capacity. As a result, the fabrication of functional adsorbents using FDM typically relies on two main strategies. The first strategy involves post-processing modification of the printed thermoplastic scaffold to introduce adsorption-active sites through chemical functionalization or surface coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. The second strategy focuses on the preparation of composite filaments by incorporating adsorptive fillers into thermoplastic matrices prior to printing, thereby integrating structural formability with adsorption functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> A schematically illustrates a representative process for fabricating composite filaments using sodium alginate (SA) as an adsorptive component and polycaprolactone (PCL) as a thermoplastic matrix. In this approach, SA is dissolved at a predetermined ratio in a dichloromethane (DCM) solution containing PCL (a1). After solvent evaporation, the resulting composite film is cut into fragments (a2), which are subsequently fed into a hot extruder for melting and extrusion to produce PCL/SA composite filaments with combined adsorptive and thermoplastic characteristics (a3–a5). These filaments can then be employed for the fabrication of structured adsorbents using various printing modalities, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> B. Free-form adsorbents can be manually fabricated using a 3D printing pen (b1–b3), while geometrically defined structures, such as cylindrical adsorbents, can be produced using conventional FDM printers (b4–b5). Moreover, bioinspired architectures, including root-mimetic structures, can be realized through specialized growth-based robotic printing systems (b6–b8). Such examples highlight the versatility of FDM in generating complex macroscopic geometries, albeit with limitations in fine structural resolution and interlayer bonding strength.</p>

          <p>DIW differs fundamentally from FDM in that it employs viscoelastic inks composed of solid powders dispersed in liquid media, which are extruded through a nozzle under applied pressure to form self-supporting structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. DIW exhibits exceptional material compatibility, encompassing inorganic ceramics, carbon-based materials, polymer hydrogels, and composite systems, thereby offering a highly flexible platform for fabricating customized functional adsorbents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. The success of DIW critically depends on ink formulation, which must satisfy stringent rheological requirements, including pronounced shear-thinning behavior to ensure smooth extrusion, as well as sufficient yield stress and elastic recovery to maintain structural fidelity after deposition. In current practice, DIW-based adsorbent fabrication typically involves dispersing adsorptive powders, such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or biochar, into liquid binders, followed by printing and subsequent post-processing steps, including drying, crosslinking, or sintering, to generate porous adsorption architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. Compared with FDM, DIW offers superior control over internal pore networks and material distribution, but often at the expense of reduced mechanical robustness and increased sensitivity to processing conditions.</p>

            <title>2.2. Vat photopolymerization technology</title>
          
          <p>Vat photopolymerization technologies, represented by stereolithography apparatus (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP), fabricate 3D structures through the selective curing of liquid photosensitive resins using ultraviolet light.</p><p>In SLA, a focused laser beam scans the resin surface along predefined paths to solidify each layer, whereas DLP employs a projected light pattern to cure an entire layer simultaneously, resulting in higher fabrication efficiency. Both techniques are capable of producing complex geometries with exceptionally high dimensional accuracy, surface quality, and feature resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], making them particularly attractive for precision manufacturing applications.</p><p>In addition to conventional SLA and DLP, advanced vat photopolymerization approaches employing full-surface curing but alternative projection mechanisms have been developed, including Masked Stereolithography (MSLA), also known as liquid crystal display (LCD)-based stereolithography, and Mask-Image-Projection-based Stereolithography (MIP-SL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. Despite their technical advantages, the application of vat photopolymerization in adsorbent preparation remains relatively limited, primarily due to the chemical sensitivity and functional constraints of commercially available photosensitive resins. The restricted material palette poses challenges for directly imparting adsorption functionality, thereby limiting large-scale adoption.</p><p>Current research efforts generally follow two main pathways. The first involves incorporating micro- or nano-scale adsorptive particles into photosensitive resins to form composite systems that retain photocurability while introducing adsorption capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. The second pathway focuses on fabricating high-precision structural skeletons via vat photopolymerization, followed by post-printing surface functionalization to impart adsorption activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, a composite ink composed of glycol diacrylate (PEG200DA), photocurable resin, and a photoinitiator is used to fabricate a structured template via DLP printing (A). The printed scaffold is subsequently immersed in a coupling agent solution containing glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane and (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS) to achieve surface modification (B). After rinsing and drying, a 3D structured adsorbent with tailored surface functionality is obtained (C). This strategy underscores the strength of vat photopolymerization in delivering geometrically precise frameworks, while highlighting the reliance on secondary modification to achieve functional performance.</p>

          <p>SLS is a representative powder bed fusion technology that employs a high-energy laser beam to selectively sinter polymer or metal powders in a layer-by-layer manner, forming 3D structures without the need for additional binders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. This process enables the direct fabrication of porous components with high mechanical strength, thermal stability, and structural integrity—properties that are difficult to achieve with extrusion- or photopolymerization-based methods. From a manufacturing perspective, SLS has clear advantages in fabricating mechanically robust adsorption frameworks or load-bearing skeletons that can be functionalized for adsorption. Its inherent strength and interconnected porosity make it well-suited for dynamic flow and long-term service. However, SLS’s application in adsorbent preparation is still at an early stage, mainly limited by the lack of powders with intrinsic adsorption properties, as well as high process costs and energy consumption. Further research is needed to expand material options and integrate SLS with post-processing or hybrid manufacturing for advanced adsorption devices.</p>

</inline-formula>-electron clouds between aromatic structures, hydrogen bonding interactions as specific strong dipole–dipole forces, and biospecific adsorption based on molecular recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>]. Regardless of the dominant interaction mechanism, adsorption fundamentally occurs at the solid–liquid interface. Consequently, specific surface area and pore architecture—particularly the presence and connectivity of micro- and mesopores-constitute the primary physical parameters governing adsorption capacity and mass transfer behavior. Based on these principles, a wide spectrum of materials, ranging from conventional high-surface-area adsorbents such as activated carbon and zeolites to porous polymers and even various industrial wastes, have been extensively developed and employed as adsorption media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>].</p><p>When these materials are fabricated into structured adsorbents via 3D printing, however, their design and application paradigm undergoes a substantial transformation from a manufacturing perspective. In contrast to conventional particulate or bulk adsorbents, 3D printing imposes additional and often stringent requirements on material systems, extending beyond adsorption performance to include printability-related properties such as rheological behavior, curing characteristics, shape retention, and interlayer bonding stability. As a result, materials suitable for 3D-printed adsorbents must achieve a delicate balance between microscale adsorption activity and macroscale formability, ensuring that functional performance is preserved while structurally robust architectures can be reliably manufactured.</p><p>To address these constraints, extensive efforts have been devoted to the targeted adaptation and modification of diverse material systems. Strategies include tailoring material composition to improve extrusion or curing behavior, introducing binders or secondary phases to enhance structural integrity, and designing composite systems that decouple adsorption functionality from load-bearing frameworks. Representative examples of 3D-printed adsorbents fabricated from different material systems and structural designs are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, highlighting the diversity of achievable architectures, surface morphologies, and internal pore structures.</p>

          <p>Common natural polymer materials for adsorption include chitosan (CS) and SA. Chitosan is a natural biopolymer synthesized by deacetylation of chitin. It is an unbranched polysaccharide, commonly found in shrimp shells and crab shells. It is rich in amino and hydroxyl groups and can adsorb heavy metals and dyes through chelation and electrostatic interactions. Appuhamillage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>] successfully prepared a series of cDAP 3D-printed hydrogel adsorbents using diacrylated Pluronic F-127 (DAP) and chitosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> A). The optimal formulation cDAP-1X (1 wt% chitosan + 25 wt% DAP) has both good printability and mechanical strength (Young's modulus 1.93 kPa), and can print thin sheets, cups, and complex internal pore structures. It has excellent adsorption effects on four heavy metals: within 30 minutes, the removal rates of Cu<inline-formula>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>] obtained a 3D PEGDA monolithic skeleton through vat photopolymerization technology. Chitosan is covalently grafted onto the PEGDA skeleton through silane coupling agents, significantly improving mechanical performance (storage modulus 427.73 MPa) and structural stability. Under optimal conditions (chitosan concentration 2 wt%, soaking time 45 minutes, pH = 6.3, 60℃), the maximum adsorption capacity for methyl orange is 12.7 mg/g, and the removal rate is 90.4%. The adsorption process conforms to the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The BOD removal rate for actual textile wastewater reaches 62.4%, while the COD removal rate is relatively low (2%); the adsorbent can be recycled 4 times, and the removal rate remains 78% after 4 cycles, which can be simply regenerated by desorption with deionized water rinsing.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> summarizes recent research on natural and synthetic polymers for 3D-printed adsorbents in water pollution treatment.

Adsorption experiments showed that the hexagonal printed structure has the optimal adsorption performance, with a MB removal rate of 99.8%, and good adsorption effects on various cationic dyes. The adsorption rate is negatively correlated with the steric hindrance of dyes; moreover, the adsorbent adsorbs rapidly and can reach equilibrium within 20 minutes. In addition, the adsorbent has excellent regeneration performance. It can be recycled 10 times after desorption with 0.1 <inline-formula>

          <p>Graphene oxide (GO) is a graphene derivative. Graphene itself is an allotrope of carbon, and carbon atoms are bonded with sp² hybridization to form a single-layer hexagonal honeycomb lattice graphene. Using strong oxidants to react with graphite or graphene can insert a large number of oxygen-containing groups between graphite layers and expand the interlayer spacing, facilitating the entry of substances. It has a huge specific surface area and rich oxygen-containing functional groups, and can adsorb pollutants through various interactions. Zhang et al.

          <p>Natural zeolites are aluminosilicate minerals and porous materials that can sieve substances at the molecular scale. Currently, a large number of synthetic zeolites are also available. They have regular pores and cation exchange capacity, and are often used to adsorb ions and gases. Khalil et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>] mixed Y-type zeolite, nano-clay, PVA, surfactant, defoamer, and deionized water in proportion, and stirred uniformly to form a printable slurry with shear thinning characteristics. Y-type zeolite-based composite adsorbents were successfully prepared through DIW 3D printing technology. The Y-type zeolite content reaches 78.5%, and the specific surface area after calcination reaches 384 m<inline-formula>

The adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorbent has good cyclic stability, and maintains structural integrity and adsorption performance after 10 adsorption-regeneration cycles. 0.5 M NaCl solution can effectively achieve desorption and regeneration. Moreover, the designed hyperboloid cylindrical structure printed achieves the self-sealing effect of columnar dynamic adsorption, suitable for continuous flow water treatment systems, and can achieve solid-liquid separation without additional filtration steps.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite is a calcium phosphate salt slightly soluble in water, and is the main inorganic component of vertebrate bones and teeth.

          <p>Diatomite is a biogenic siliceous sedimentary rock with a lightweight and porous structure, mainly composed of the remains of ancient diatoms, containing a small amount of clay minerals or volcanic ash, and is often used for filtration and adsorption. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_110">110</xref>] mixed 20 wt% diatomite powder with an aqueous solution of 2.5 wt% polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1.5 wt% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and stirred uniformly to form a stable slurry as the core adsorption material system. Then, a negative mold of gyroids structure (diameter 20 mm, height 20 mm) was designed through CAD. The volume fractions of the sacrificial template were 6%, 12%, and 18%. The sacrificial template was prepared by SLA 3D printing (the resin contains wax components for easy subsequent removal). Hierarchically porous diatomite scaffolds were prepared by the “3D printed sacrificial template + freeze casting ice template" dual-template method, forming a three-level structure of “millimeter-scale spiral pores (2.36–2.82 mm) – micron-scale layered pores (8.25–13.77 <inline-formula>

In this preparation method, the volume fraction of the sacrificial template determines the millimeter-scale pore size, and the cooling rate regulates the micron-scale pore spacing; the three-level pore structure dominates the adsorption and permeability performance. The millimeter-scale pores improve mass transfer efficiency, and the nano-scale pores provide adsorption sites, greatly improving various performances of the adsorbent.</p>

            <title>3.4. Industrial/biological wastes</title>
          
          <p>In industry and agriculture, there are some unavoidable by-products and wastes with very large output. They themselves may not have very excellent adsorption capacity, but they have the advantage of waste utilization and local materials. There are few studies on the application of such raw materials in 3D printing adsorbents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>).</p>

          <p>For example, red mud (RM) is the main waste residue discharged after extracting alumina from bauxite. It is a typical representative of bulk industrial solid waste, rich in iron and aluminum oxides, and has strong adsorption capacity for anions (such as arsenic, phosphorus). Fly ash is fine particulate powder collected from flue gas after coal combustion in coal-fired power plants. It is formed by cooling the non-combustible mineral components brought out by flue gas after high-temperature combustion of coal powder. It has high porosity and can be used as a precursor of geopolymers. Almeida et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_112">112</xref>] pretreated RM from the aluminum industry and biomass fly ash (FA) from the biomass energy industry by grinding and sieving, mixed them with metakaolin in different proportions, and then added an alkali activator (sodium silicate: sodium hydroxide: water = 392:55.5:52.48) to adjust the liquid-solid ratio (0.60–1.01) to obtain printing ink. Geopolymer adsorbents containing high proportions of industrial wastes (up to 80 wt%, 40% RM + 40% FA) were prepared by DIW 3D printing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>). Among them, the optimal formulation (30% FA + 40% RM + 30% MK) has both high mechanical strength (26.94 MPa) and high specific surface area (40 m<inline-formula>

The content of waste significantly affects the performance of the adsorbent, and the comprehensive performance is optimal when the FA content is 30%; the larger the nozzle diameter and the layer rotation angle of the printed part is 90°, the higher the mechanical strength of the adsorbent, while the specific surface area is larger (55 m<inline-formula>

In addition, the adsorbent has stable performance under acidic conditions (pH = 4), suitable for acidic lead-containing wastewater treatment, and the heavy metal leakage meets environmental protection requirements, with no secondary pollution risk.</p>

          <p>Agricultural waste biomass, such as rice husks and sugarcane bagasse, can be directly used as cheap adsorbents, or pyrolyzed into biochar or extracted for effective components. Biochar has the characteristics of porosity, large specific surface area, and rich surface functional groups, and is a broad-spectrum adsorbent. Silva et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_113">113</xref>] prepared biochar from rice husks and added it to SA water-based ink (Alg) in different proportions to obtain Alg/Biochar composite hydrogel ink. Among them, Alg/Biochar10 (10% biochar content) has the optimal performance. The adsorption capacities for IBU and MB reach 111.4 mg/g and 214.6 mg/g, respectively, which are 48% and 58% higher than those of pure SA hydrogel. The adsorption mechanisms are: IBU adsorption is mainly based on hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces, while MB adsorption is mainly based on electrostatic attraction (negative charges on the adsorbent surface and MB cations) and <inline-formula>

Under the conditions of 298.15 K and initial concentration 100 mg/L, the adsorption rate reaches 92.66% within 24 hours and equilibrium is reached within 800 minutes; the increase in pH and temperature is conducive to adsorption, while the increase in ion strength inhibits adsorption.

      <title>4. From structural design to performance optimization: strategies and challenges</title>
      <p>With the rapid development of 3D-printed adsorbents, the compatibility between additive manufacturing technologies and diverse material systems has been progressively enhanced. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that, through rational structural design, appropriate material selection, and targeted post-processing strategies, 3D-printed adsorbents can achieve adsorption capacities comparable to or even exceeding those of their corresponding raw materials, while maintaining verified recyclability over multiple cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>]. From a manufacturing perspective, these improvements do not solely originate from intrinsic material properties, but rather from the synergistic optimization of geometry, multi-scale pore architecture, and post-fabrication functionalization enabled by digital fabrication technologies.</p><p>Despite these advances, current 3D-printed adsorbents still face several fundamental challenges when transitioning from laboratory demonstrations to practical deployment. In particular, limitations related to pore-scale hierarchy, long-term chemical and mechanical stability, and engineering performance under dynamic operating conditions remain significant. Addressing these issues requires a systematic understanding of how structural design and manufacturing constraints jointly influence mass transfer behavior, structural integrity, and device-level performance. The following sections therefore discuss key strategies and remaining challenges associated with hierarchical pore construction, stability for recyclability, and engineering performance evaluation in dynamic adsorption processes.</p>

            <title>4.1. Construction of hierarchical pore structures and enhancement of mass transfer</title>
          
          <p>Compared with conventional particulate or bulk adsorbents, 3D-printed adsorbents offer distinct advantages in terms of geometric controllability, ease of recovery, and efficient material utilization, owing to their customizable size and architecture. However, most commonly used 3D printing technologies are inherently limited to the construction of structures at the microscale level, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the micropores and mesopores that constitute the primary adsorption sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>].</p><p>This pronounced scale gap between printed microscale features and intrinsic nanoscale pores introduces complex transport phenomena during adsorption. The abrupt transition from microscale flow channels to nanoscale pores can significantly influence gas–liquid displacement behavior, interfacial stability during pore infiltration, and the morphology of the advancing liquid front. As a result, different infiltration modes, such as complete penetration or partial wetting, may occur within the adsorbent structure. These effects directly impact permeation rates and mass transfer efficiency, which at the macroscopic level manifest as variations in adsorption kinetics and the occurrence of channeling phenomena during dynamic adsorption processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_126">126</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_127">127</xref>]. Such issues are further exacerbated under adsorption-dominated conditions, where relatively low fluid pressures and confining stresses prevail, making the system particularly sensitive to pore architecture.</p><p>In this context, the rational construction of hierarchical pore structures spanning micropores, mesopores, macropores, and microscale seepage channels is increasingly recognized as a critical development direction for next-generation 3D-printed adsorbents. Currently, two main strategies are employed to achieve such multi-level porosity. The first strategy involves post-printing pore-forming processes, whereby additional porosity is introduced into an initially solidified structure through physical or chemical treatments. Representative approaches include: (i) freeze-drying, which is particularly suitable for hydrogel- or biomass-based inks and generates interconnected macroporous networks through ice crystal growth and sublimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>]; (ii) sintering or pyrolysis, commonly applied to ceramic or metal slurries containing polymer binders or pore-forming agents, where the thermal removal of organic components or gas evolution during decomposition yields internally connected porous skeletons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>]; and (iii) chemical etching, which selectively removes one phase from composite materials to create additional pore networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>].</p><p>The second strategy relies on the direct incorporation of active raw materials possessing inherent high specific surface areas and abundant micro- and mesopores-such as activated carbon powders, MOFs particles, zeolites, and highly porous biochars-into 3D printing inks as the primary functional phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_95">95</xref>]. This approach enables the retention of nanoscale adsorption functionality while leveraging printed microscale architectures to improve mass transfer and handling characteristics.</p><p>Advanced characterization techniques are essential for understanding and optimizing such hierarchical structures. In particular, nanoscale X-ray computed tomography (Nano-CT) enables 3D visualization of pore architectures larger than approximately 50 nm, providing valuable insights into the connectivity and spatial distribution of macropores and microscale flow channels within printed adsorbents.</p>

            <title>4.2. Stability as the chemical and mechanical foundation for recyclability</title>
          
          <p>The feasibility of recycling and reusing 3D-printed adsorbents fundamentally depends on their stability, which encompasses both chemical and mechanical aspects. Chemical stability is critical to prevent degradation of adsorption functionality and to avoid secondary pollution arising from material leaching. In most existing studies, chemical stability is indirectly assessed by comparing material characteristics before and after adsorption using techniques such as SEM, FTIR, and XRD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>]. More direct evaluations, including leaching experiments and compositional analyses following repeated adsorption cycles, have also been reported in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_125">125</xref>].</p><p>For materials with complex or poorly defined compositions—such as composites derived from multiple industrial wastes—it is strongly recommended to conduct leaching toxicity tests or targeted dissolution analyses under representative water chemistry conditions to mitigate environmental risks. For materials with well-defined compositions, in-depth surface chemical state analyses, for example using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), after recycling can provide valuable insights into degradation pathways and failure mechanisms at the material–solution interface.</p><p>Mechanical stability represents another critical, yet often underexplored, dimension of recyclability. At present, no unified standard exists for evaluating the mechanical robustness of 3D-printed adsorbents, and experimental protocols vary widely depending on simulated hydraulic conditions such as stirring intensity or flow-induced scouring. Moreover, different material systems exhibit distinct failure modes, including brittle fracture, plastic deformation, swelling, or structural disintegration. Consequently, many studies rely primarily on qualitative observations, for example reporting that “the structure remains intact after adsorption,” which provides limited quantitative insight.</p><p>More advanced investigations have introduced quantitative mechanical assessments, including: (i) compressive strength or elastic modulus measurements, particularly suitable for monolithic structures to evaluate load-bearing capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_107">107</xref>]; and (ii) mass loss rate measurements before and after simulated flow or agitation tests to assess mechanical degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>]. From an engineering standpoint, fragmentation-induced secondary pollution poses a significant risk in environmental applications. Therefore, mechanical stability evaluation should be integrated into the early stages of material and structural design rather than deferred to later engineering validation. While comprehensive mechanical testing may not always be feasible, selecting at least one relevant and quantifiable mechanical metric tailored to the intended application scenario is strongly encouraged.</p>

            <title>4.3. Evaluation of engineering performance in dynamic adsorption processes</title>
          
          <p>In dynamic adsorption configurations, such as fixed-bed or monolithic adsorption devices commonly referred to as filters, operational conditions are inherently more complex than those encountered in batch systems. Beyond basic stability considerations, engineering parameters including pressure drop, adsorption rate or breakthrough behavior, and optimal operating flow rates play a decisive role in determining whether an adsorption device can function efficiently with acceptable energy consumption.</p><p>Existing studies indicate that 3D-printed fixed-bed adsorption devices generally exhibit improved pressure drop characteristics compared with conventional packed powder beds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_102">102</xref>]. Nevertheless, a high adsorption rate remains a fundamental prerequisite for effective dynamic adsorption. It should be noted that adsorption interactions vary in their binding strengths, and excessively high flow rates may lead to desorption or washout of weakly bound pollutants, thereby compromising overall removal efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>].</p><p>In addition, factors such as flow channel geometry, fluid–solid friction, and structural tortuosity significantly influence the hydraulic and adsorption performance of fixed-bed devices. The ability to customize complex geometries and material compositions represents a key advantage of 3D printing; however, many existing studies remain focused on printing and shaping demonstrations without fully exploiting this capability for systematic structure–performance optimization. Even minor variations in channel design or material ratios can markedly affect adsorption behavior, rendering exhaustive experimental trial-and-error approaches impractical.</p><p>A more efficient pathway involves the integration of computational tools, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and data-driven optimization methods, including artificial intelligence, to screen and refine structural designs and material configurations prior to fabrication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_128">128</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_129">129</xref>]. Such approaches offer the potential to accelerate the development of high-performance 3D-printed adsorption devices by establishing quantitative links between digital design parameters, manufacturing constraints, and engineering performance outcomes.</p>

      <title>5. Frontier expansion and paradigm innovation</title>
      <p>Beyond incremental improvements in adsorption performance and structural optimization, recent developments in 3D-printed adsorbents indicate the emergence of new application frontiers and manufacturing paradigms. These advances extend the role of adsorption devices from conventional pollutant removal toward risk mitigation, functional integration, and precision structural design. From a manufacturing perspective, such trends reflect a gradual shift from single-material, performance-driven fabrication toward multi-functional, architecture-driven, and paradigm-oriented design strategies. The following sections highlight several representative directions that exemplify this evolution.</p>

            <title>5.1. Adsorption and solidification of high-risk pollutants</title>
          
          <p>Compared with other water treatment technologies, adsorption exhibits a distinctive advantage when recycling is not a primary concern: its inherently non-contact nature. This characteristic becomes particularly valuable when handling high-risk pollutants, where direct interaction or secondary processing may pose significant safety hazards. Typical examples include radioactive iodine in medical wastewater, nuclear wastewater, and radioactive nuclides in nuclear-contaminated water, which present severe health risks while offering limited recycling value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_130">130</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_131">131</xref>].</p><p>For such pollutants, the prevailing treatment strategy involves their separation from the aqueous phase followed by solidification and long-term encapsulation. This approach has emerged as an important frontier for 3D-printed adsorbents and introduces new design requirements that extend beyond conventional adsorption metrics. In this context, adsorption devices must function not only as separation media but also as structural matrices capable of immobilizing hazardous species over extended timescales. Consequently, radiation resistance, long-term structural integrity, and reliable solidification capacity become critical performance criteria, posing substantial challenges for material selection and manufacturing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_95">95</xref>].</p><p>From a fabrication standpoint, these requirements call for the development of structurally robust, geometrically controllable, and chemically stable architectures that can be precisely manufactured and reliably sealed. The integration of adsorption and solidification functions within a single printed structure thus represents a paradigm shift from reversible adsorption systems toward safety-oriented, terminal containment devices.</p>

            <title>5.2. Multi-material printing as a paradigm for resolving the strength-porosity trade-off</title>
          
          <p>A long-standing challenge in the fabrication of 3D-printed adsorbents is the inherent trade-off between porosity and mechanical strength. High porosity is desirable for maximizing adsorption capacity and mass transfer efficiency; however, it often leads to compromised mechanical integrity, resulting in structural instability, fragmentation, and difficulties in recovery. Conventional solutions typically rely on empirical compromises, such as thickening printed filaments to compensate for strength loss, which in turn reduces material utilization efficiency due to limited fluid penetration.</p><p>Emerging multi-material printing technologies offer a fundamentally different strategy to address this contradiction by decoupling load-bearing and adsorption functions at the structural level. Core–shell 3D printing, for instance, employs concentric nozzles to simultaneously extrude two distinct materials at the same deposition rate, with one material encapsulating the other during printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_132">132</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_133">133</xref>]. In this configuration, a mechanically robust and low-cost material can serve as the internal skeleton, while a porous, adsorption-active material forms the external shell. Mechanical strength can be tuned by adjusting the inner core diameter, without increasing the thickness of the adsorption layer, thereby avoiding unnecessary material waste.</p><p>Similarly, multi-material rotational co-extrusion printing introduces two materials through a Y-shaped flow channel into a shared nozzle, where they converge and are extruded concurrently. Owing to the high viscosity and shear-thinning behavior of the inks, the materials remain in laminar flow and form distinct layers without intermixing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_134">134</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_135">135</xref>]. Through controlled rotation during extrusion, the spatial distribution of skeletal and adsorption phases can be tailored, enabling enhanced structural strength or impact resistance, depending on the application scenario.</p><p>Although these advanced printing strategies have been validated in other manufacturing fields, their systematic exploration in water treatment applications remains limited. Their adoption has the potential to establish a new fabrication paradigm in which mechanical robustness and adsorption performance are no longer competing objectives but are independently optimized through architectural design.</p>

            <title>5.3. 3d printing as a precision template strategy</title>
          
          <p>Prior to the advent of additive manufacturing, template-based methods were widely employed to fabricate 3D structured adsorbents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_136">136</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_137">137</xref>]. In contrast to conventional templates, 3D-printed templates offer substantially greater design freedom at the macroscopic scale, along with significant cost advantages for the reproducible fabrication of complex geometries.</p><p>As the spectrum of emerging pollutants continues to expand, specific adsorption based on molecular recognition is becoming increasingly important. However, many highly selective adsorption materials lack sufficient mechanical strength or processability for direct 3D printing. In such cases, the use of 3D-printed structures as precision templates, followed by physical or chemical surface modification to impart adsorption functionality, represents a promising alternative fabrication strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_109">109</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_138">138</xref>].</p><p>From a manufacturing perspective, this approach enables a clear separation between structural form generation and functional material deposition. By leveraging the geometric precision of digital fabrication and the versatility of post-printing modification, adsorption performance can be tailored without sacrificing structural integrity. This template-based paradigm thus extends the role of 3D printing from a direct manufacturing tool to a versatile platform for precision structural engineering and functional integration in advanced adsorption systems.</p>

            <title>6.1. Comprehensive summary of the review</title>
          
          <p>This review systematically surveys recent progress in the development of 3D-printed structured adsorbents for water pollution treatment, with a comprehensive discussion spanning additive manufacturing technologies, material systems, structural design strategies, and performance optimization pathways. By integrating insights from materials science, advanced manufacturing, and environmental engineering, the review highlights how digital fabrication is reshaping the conceptual and practical framework of adsorption-based water treatment.</p><p>As global water pollution challenges continue to intensify in terms of pollutant diversity, concentration variability, and treatment complexity, conventional adsorbents increasingly exhibit inherent limitations, including difficult recovery, inefficient mass transfer, and insufficient mechanical robustness. Additive manufacturing, particularly 3D printing, offers a fundamentally new engineering pathway for overcoming these constraints through precise structural customization, flexible fabrication, and broad material adaptability. Accordingly, this review first categorizes and analyzes three major classes of 3D printing technologies applicable to adsorbent fabrication—material extrusion (e.g., FDM and DIW), vat photopolymerization (e.g., SLA and DLP), and powder bed fusion (e.g., SLS)—with emphasis on their respective material compatibility, fabrication resolution, and process complexity.</p><p>From the perspective of material systems, a wide range of functional materials have been successfully integrated with 3D printing technologies, including polymeric materials (e.g., chitosan and SA), advanced functional materials (e.g., metal–organic frameworks, GO, and MXene), natural minerals and their derivatives (e.g., clays, zeolites, and geopolymers), as well as industrial and biological wastes (e.g., RM and biochar). Through strategies such as compounding, filler incorporation, and post-printing functionalization, these materials can achieve efficient adsorption of heavy metals, dyes, and emerging organic pollutants while maintaining sufficient printability and demonstrating promising cyclic utilization potential.</p><p>Structural design emerges as a central factor governing the performance of 3D-printed adsorbents. This review emphasizes the construction of hierarchical pore architectures via post-processing pore-forming strategies and the use of intrinsically porous active raw materials to synergistically enhance mass transfer efficiency and adsorption capacity. In parallel, chemical and mechanical stability are identified as decisive prerequisites for practical deployment. While current studies are gradually transitioning from qualitative observations toward quantitative assessments—such as compressive strength and mass loss measurements—a universally accepted evaluation framework has yet to be established.</p><p>Regarding engineering performance in dynamic adsorption processes, 3D-printed fixed-bed and monolithic adsorption devices demonstrate clear advantages, including reduced pressure drop and simplified recovery. However, the relationship between structure and performance remains highly complex, underscoring the need for precise design and optimization approaches that integrate CFD simulations and data-driven methodologies.</p><p>Overall, additive manufacturing is driving a paradigm shift in adsorption technology, transforming adsorbents from conventional powders or granules into structurally engineered devices. Through the coordinated design of macroscopic architectures and microscopic material functionalities, 3D-printed adsorbents not only enhance adsorption performance but also significantly improve operational reliability and engineering applicability. Nevertheless, critical challenges remain, including the trade-off between porosity and mechanical strength, inconsistent performance evaluation practices, and the absence of systematic cost–benefit analyses. Addressing these issues is essential for accelerating the translation of laboratory-scale demonstrations into real-world water treatment applications.</p>

                <title>6.2.1 Standardization of performance evaluation and data comparability</title>
              
              <p>In current literature, adsorption performance is commonly reported under optimal experimental conditions, which is effective for demonstrating material potential. However, substantial variability in parameters such as initial pollutant concentration, solution pH, and adsorbent dosage significantly limits the comparability of reported adsorption capacities across different studies.</p><p>Among these factors, the non-standardized and sometimes ambiguous reporting of adsorbent dosage represents a particularly critical issue. Adsorbent dosage, typically expressed as the mass-to-volume ratio (m/V), directly governs the effective adsorbent–pollutant ratio and exerts a decisive influence on the apparent adsorption capacity. Nevertheless, existing studies frequently exhibit inconsistent dosage selection within the same work, employ vague descriptors such as “pieces,” or omit the rationale for dosage determination altogether. Such practices undermine data reproducibility and hinder meaningful comparison.</p><p>Fundamentally, for materials exhibiting complex adsorption mechanisms involving both physical and chemical interactions, apparent adsorption capacity is intrinsically dosage-dependent. Under non-saturated conditions, variations in dosage alter the equilibrium pollutant concentration, thereby influencing adsorption outcomes. Consequently, discussing adsorption capacity in isolation from dosage parameters can be misleading.</p><p>Although accurately determining wet mass for certain materials, such as hydrogels, presents technical challenges, this further underscores the urgency of establishing clear and reproducible experimental and reporting standards. Future studies are therefore encouraged to: (1) uniformly and explicitly report all key experimental parameters, particularly adsorbent dosage using standardized units (e.g., g/L or mg/mL); (2) interpret adsorption performance in conjunction with adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and dosage-dependent behavior rather than relying solely on single optimal values; and (3) clearly justify dosage selection based on preliminary experiments or realistic application scenarios.</p>

                <title>6.2.2 Life-cycle cost considerations and sustainability-oriented design</title>
              
              <p>A traditional advantage of adsorption lies in its potential cost-effectiveness and operational simplicity. However, in the context of 3D-printed adsorbents, high adsorption performance is often pursued through complex pre-processing steps, energy-intensive printing technologies, or elaborate post-treatment procedures. While such approaches can enhance material performance and structural precision, they also increase fabrication complexity and economic cost, potentially conflicting with the fundamental appeal of adsorption as a simple and economical treatment method.</p><p>Importantly, the core value proposition of 3D-printed adsorbents resides not merely in material-level performance but in system-level engineering advantages—such as high flux, low pressure drop, and simplified recovery—that are difficult to achieve with conventional powder or granular adsorbents. From a life-cycle perspective, a reusable monolithic adsorbent that eliminates repeated solid–liquid separation steps may ultimately offer lower operational costs than disposable particulate materials.</p><p>Accordingly, comparisons based solely on preparation cost at the laboratory stage are often insufficient and potentially misleading. Future research should emphasize the integrated design of performance, cost, and sustainability by promoting the use of low-value or waste-derived raw materials, simplified fabrication routes, and mild processing conditions. Advancing from performance-driven demonstrations toward application-oriented optimization is essential for enabling engineering translation.</p><p>Furthermore, as an environmentally motivated research field, the ecological footprint associated with material selection, energy consumption, and by-product generation during the entire fabrication process should be explicitly considered. The adoption of environmentally benign materials and the valorization of industrial and agricultural wastes merit continued emphasis.</p>

                <title>6.2.3 Interdisciplinary integration and intelligent design paradigms</title>
              
              <p>Research on 3D-printed adsorbents is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging materials science, environmental engineering, advanced manufacturing, and fluid mechanics. Future breakthroughs are likely to depend on a fundamental shift from empirical trial-and-error approaches toward data-driven, simulation-first, and intelligently controlled manufacturing paradigms, necessitating deeper integration with computational sciences.</p><p>At the material and process optimization level, machine learning and artificial intelligence offer transformative opportunities. The compatibility between adsorbent materials and binders, as well as subtle variations in printing parameters such as extrusion pressure, printing speed, and layer thickness, can exert complex and coupled effects on structural fidelity, pore architecture, and final performance. Emerging studies have demonstrated the feasibility of predicting adsorption isotherm behavior and maximum adsorption capacity based solely on material composition and preparation parameters, pointing toward a future in which reverse design becomes possible. By constructing high-quality experimental databases and leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms to uncover hidden correlations among material, process, structure, and performance, optimal formulations and printing conditions can be intelligently recommended according to target treatment requirements.</p><p>At the device and system level, computational tools are transitioning from optional aids to essential components of the design workflow. As 3D printing evolves from producing simple adsorption blocks to fabricating integrated adsorption devices and reactors with complex internal flow architectures, traditional experimental fluid dynamics approaches become increasingly inefficient. CFD simulations enable the prediction and optimization of flow distribution, mass transfer efficiency, pressure drop, and channeling resistance for various channel geometries prior to fabrication. This “simulation–screening–printing–validation” cycle allows the theoretical freedom of digital design to be translated into tangible performance gains.</p><p>Beyond these aspects, intelligent manufacturing paradigms facilitate broader interdisciplinary integration. Potential directions include coupling adsorption structures with catalytic or oxidative functionalities through multi-material printing to realize adsorption–degradation synergy, embedding conductive sensing elements to develop intelligent adsorbents capable of real-time monitoring, and integrating life-cycle assessment tools at the digital design stage to guide sustainable manufacturing decisions.</p><p>In conclusion, future research on 3D-printed adsorbents should transcend isolated material modification and simplistic geometric replication. The long-term vision entails completing the entire virtual-to-physical workflow within a digital environment—from molecular-scale active site design and macro–micro structural topology optimization to system-level hydraulic performance prediction via multi-physics simulation and artificial intelligence—followed by accurate materialization of the optimized design through advanced multi-material and multi-scale additive manufacturing. Embracing this paradigm will enable 3D-printed adsorbents to evolve from an emerging fabrication technique into a central technological engine driving the next generation of water treatment solutions.</p>
