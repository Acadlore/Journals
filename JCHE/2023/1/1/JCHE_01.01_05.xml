      <abstract><p>In response to the mechanical performance alterations of PVC-P geomembranes due to improper handling or subgrade particle action during construction and operation, a series of axial tensile tests on PVC-P geomembranes with various scratch damages were conducted. Multifactorial variance analysis was performed using Python, and a multivariate regression model for the fracture strength and elongation at break of scratched PVC-P geomembranes was developed using SPSS. The precision of the regression model was evaluated using parameters such as the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results indicated that the fracture strength and elongation at break of PVC-P geomembranes are significantly affected by a combination of scratch angle, length, and depth. The impact on elongation at break is greater than on fracture strength, with the scratch angle having the most significant effect. The developed multivariate regression model yielded R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.98 and 0.97 for fracture strength and elongation at break, respectively. The MAEs were 0.62 kN/m and 7.96%, and the MAPEs were 3.06% and 5.13%, respectively. The RMSEs were 0.84 kN/m and 12.08%. The high fitting accuracy of the model suggests its utility for evaluating the mechanical performance of PVC-P geomembranes with scratch damage.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>PVC-P geomembranes, recognized for their low cost, strong adaptability to deformation, minimal climatic impact, and ease of construction, have been widely applied in impermeable projects such as reservoir dams, landfill sites, mining, and water conveyance tunnels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. According to the International Commission on Large Dams (2010), 86 out of 167 geomembrane-impermeable dams globally utilize PVC-P geomembranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. In China, the use of geomembrane for impermeability began in the early 1980s, primarily in reinforcement projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], and later extended to new small and medium-sized hydropower projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], predominantly employing HDPE/PE geomembranes. Early 21st-century projects revealed mechanical deficiencies in HDPE/PE geomembranes, such as poor adaptability to differential deformation and excessive hardness in thicknesses over 1.0mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. In contrast, PVC-P geomembranes with a thickness of no less than 2.5mm maintained superior flexibility, leading to their growing recognition and application in projects such as the VI Level of the Nam Ou River Cascade Hydropower Project and the Jiangpinghe Hydropower Stations. Extensive research by domestic scholars on the application of PVC-P geomembranes in face membrane rockfill dams has achieved significant progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], with findings being utilized in high-face membrane rockfill dam impermeability projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>During construction and operation, geomembranes are susceptible to structural damage from external disturbances, resulting in a decline in mechanical performance. Whether this meets the engineering design standards/specifications has been a subject of extensive research. Investigations by Gallagher et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] into landfill integrity found geomembrane damage such as wrinkles, holes, and scratches, primarily caused by construction equipment or techniques, but their focus was on holes and wrinkles, lacking precise mechanical analysis of scratch damage. Research by Giroud and Morel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] derived relationships between various parameters of wrinkled geomembrane damage and external conditions, yet only considering horizontally based wrinkle shapes and not analyzing different wrinkle forms. Study by Narejo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] on long-term and short-term puncture tests of HDPE geomembranes proposed empirical formulas for top puncture, applicable only to HDPE geomembranes, offering limited guidance for other types. Stark et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] conducted top puncture tests on PVC geomembranes, exploring relationships between top puncture height, force, and thickness, but failed to derive precise theoretical formulas. Research by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] on folded and perforated geomembrane axial tensile mechanical properties indicated a significant reduction in the mechanical performance of damaged HDPE geomembranes, accurately analyzing the mechanical performance changes of HDPE geomembranes with different numbers and diameters of holes, yet no theoretical formulas linking mechanical performance to hole parameters were derived. Study by Rowe and Fan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] on HDPE geomembranes with various sizes and shapes of defect holes in permeability tests concluded that the shape of the damaged hole is a major factor in increased permeability of the geomembrane, but did not analyze the permeability performance of HDPE geomembranes with scratch damage. Research by Cen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] on mechanical performance tests of HDPE geomembranes with pore-like, seam-like, and scratch-like damage found that defects and damage reduce mechanical performance; although the study analyzed the weakening of mechanical performance by scratch damage, it focused only on three depths of scratch damage, not considering the impact of different lengths and angles of scratch damage.</p><p>Due to improper laying methods during construction or the effect of sharp particles in the subgrade, PVC-P geomembranes can suffer scratch damage. Engineers cannot ascertain whether the mechanical performance degradation of scratched PVC-P geomembranes affects the safe operation of the project, with limited related experimental research and theoretical results available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Thus, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the mechanical performance degradation patterns of PVC-P geomembranes with varying degrees of scratch damage. Regression analysis, a mathematical method used to establish relationships between independent and dependent variables and construct strong correlations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], is widely applied in various fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Based on the results of axial tensile tests of scratched PVC-P geomembranes, this paper constructs a multivariate regression model to predict the degree of mechanical performance degradation under different levels of scratch damage. This provides a reference for assessing the mechanical performance of scratched PVC-P geomembranes, drawing attention from construction engineers to the importance of scratch damage in PVC-P geomembranes and from design engineers to the quality requirements of projects.</p>

          <p>In accordance with the SL235-2012 Specifications for Test and Measurement of Geosynthetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], narrow strip specimens for axial tensile tests were selected. During sample preparation, the 100 mm edge and any flawed or damaged parts of the entire geomembrane roll were discarded. Standard specimens were cut using a specially designed mold, with a gauge length of 100 mm and a width of 50 mm, as shown in subgraph (a) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The test temperature was set at 20±2°C, with a stretching rate of 10mm/min. The axial tensile testing instrument used was a universal testing machine for geosynthetic materials, with the following basic parameters: maximum load capacity of 30.0kN, maximum travel of 2.1 m, deformation detection range from 0.2% to 100% of the maximum travel, and error range within ±0.5%. During the tensile test of the specimens, the two clamps were adjusted to 100mm to keep the specimen clamped and flat. The universal testing machine was started at the set rate until the specimen broke. The start and stop of the testing machine were controlled by a computer, and the test data were collected by professional data acquisition software at a frequency of 15.0Hz.</p>

          <p>The sample preparation equipment utilized for this experiment was a self-developed scratch sampler. This instrument is made from a 0.5 mm-thick rectangular steel piece, with one end fashioned into a blade for creating scratch damage. When making the scratches, the blade is placed horizontally on the surface of the geomembrane specimen. The blade is marked with different depth scales to produce scratches of varying depths on the geomembrane. Additionally, the sampler has varying lengths corresponding to different scratch lengths. A protractor is used to measure and mark different scratch angles on the specimen. In this experiment, scratches of various angles, lengths, and depths were made in the central area of the standard specimen. To realistically reflect the different degrees of scratch damage that might occur in PVC-P geomembranes in engineering projects, the experiment was designed with a combination of seven scratch angles, seven scratch length ratios, and four scratch depth ratios. In subgraph (b) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows a specimen with one such combination of scratch damage, with the marked area indicating the location of the scratch damage. The scratch angle, denoted as <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mqadv8od7b">
    <mml:mi>α</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, is the angle between the direction of the scratch length and the axial tension direction, set at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90°. The damage length ratio, represented by <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mwvu88rijm">

  <mml:math id="m5p0vl3uqo">
    <mml:mi>γ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, is the ratio of the scratch depth to the thickness of the PVC-P geomembrane, set at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, corresponding to scratch depths of 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm, respectively. A total of 196 different combinations of scratch damage were tested in tensile tests. For each combination of scratch damage, five tests were conducted, yielding a total of 980 sets of test data.</p>

Subgraph (a) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> displays a three-dimensional scatter plot of the break strength (T) of PVC-P geomembranes with various combinations of scratch damage.

          <p>Preliminary analysis of the experimental results on the break strength and elongation at break of scratched PVC-P geomembranes indicates that <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mskpjbkxoa">
    <mml:mi>α</mml:mi>

</inline-formula>, <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, and <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m85w3ddv60">
    <mml:mi>γ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> collectively affect the mechanical properties of PVC-P geomembranes. To more accurately analyze the extent of the influence of these three factors on mechanical properties and their interactions, a multifactorial variance analysis considering interactions is employed. This analysis utilizes the P-value in the F-test to determine the significance of each factor's impact on break strength and elongation at break. A P-value greater than 0.05 suggests that the factor's impact on break strength and elongation at break is not significant, whereas a P-value of 0.05 or less indicates a significant impact. The smaller the P-value, the more significant the impact of the factor. The data were analyzed using the Python programming language, version 3.8.17, with the StatsModels library, specifically the anova_lm function. The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

  <mml:math id="m55bdhbbl5">
    <mml:mi>α</mml:mi>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> interaction, their impacts were also significant. Additionally, the P-values for all three dual-factor interactions were higher than for any single factor, indicating that the impact of dual-factor interactions is less than that of single factors. The results of the three-factor variance analysis also showed P-values less than 0.05, but these were still higher than the P-values for single and dual factors. This suggests that the combined interaction of the three factors has a less significant impact on the break strength and elongation at break of PVC-P geomembranes compared to single factors. In conclusion, the interactions between two and three factors reduce the extent of the impact exerted by single factors.</p>

            <title>4.2. Multivariate regression analysis</title>
          
          <p>To construct a regression model correlating the mechanical properties of PVC-P geomembranes with <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, and <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mxi1wym8be">
    <mml:mi>γ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between these three factors and both break strength and elongation at break. For this, the Pearson correlation coefficient method was used within the programming environment. Values for <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m45vsb9vwh">
    <mml:mi>α</mml:mi>

</inline-formula>, and <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m1fyrxuldt">
    <mml:mi>γ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, as well as the rates of decrease in break strength and elongation at break, were imported into Python, and the corr() method was called to calculate the correlation coefficients between columns. By specifying the “method=Pearson” parameter, the computation for the Pearson correlation coefficient method was carried out. The results are stored in ‘correlations’ and represented in the form of a heatmap (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>). According to the heatmap, it is evident that the break strength (T) and elongation at break (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mjqpxkn7nm">
    <mml:mi>ε</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>

    <mml:mi>γ</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> leads to a decrease in the mechanical properties of the PVC-P geomembrane, which is consistent with the experimental analysis results. Additionally, the correlation coefficients between any two of <inline-formula>

          <p>It should be noted that the models constructed are specifically for assessing the mechanical performance degradation due to scratch damage in PVC-P geomembranes. In practical engineering applications, when scratch damage occurs in PVC-P geomembranes, these models can accurately predict changes in mechanical properties. These predictions can then be compared and analyzed against the allowable values stipulated in the technical specifications for the use of geosynthetic materials. This assessment helps in determining whether the mechanical properties of scratched PVC-P geomembranes meet.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This paper conducted axial tensile mechanical tests on PVC-P geomembranes with various combinations of scratch angle, length, and depth. Based on the experimental results, regression analysis models were constructed, and the congruence between the model predictions and experimental values was analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows:</p><p>(1) Scratch damage significantly weakens the axial tensile mechanical properties of PVC-P geomembranes, with the most pronounced reduction in elongation at break. In practical engineering, efforts should be made to minimize the possibility of scratch damage to PVC-P geomembranes. It is recommended to improve construction techniques and refine construction methods, such as avoiding human and mechanical disturbances during geomembrane installation and designing appropriate particle gradation curves for subgrade layers.</p><p>(2) The mechanical properties of PVC-P geomembranes are significantly influenced by the interaction of scratch angle, length, and depth, among which the scratch angle has the most significant impact. This aspect should be given attention during construction.</p><p>(3) A multivariate regression analysis model for the break strength and elongation at break of scratched PVC-P geomembranes has been developed. This model is specific to PVC-P geomembranes and can provide a reference for assessing the mechanical performance of geomembranes with scratch damage.</p>

      <title>6. Works in the future</title>
      <p>Although the model constructed in this paper can determine the degree of mechanical performance degradation in PVC-P geomembranes with varying degrees of scratch damage, it is not convenient for practical engineering applications. Therefore, future research should focus on developing a method to accurately assess the mechanical performance of scratched PVC-P geomembranes and determine threshold values for scratch damage in terms of angle, length, and depth that affect the mechanical properties of PVC-P geomembranes.</p>
