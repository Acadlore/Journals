      <abstract><p>The Ponan tradition, deeply rooted in Poto Village, Moyo Hilir District, Sumbawa Regency, Indonesia, exemplifies a unique form of local wisdom with significant social, cultural, and economic potential. Despite its cultural prominence, the integration of this tradition into tourism development has been hindered by inadequate infrastructure, insufficient promotional strategies, and limited community engagement. This study addresses these challenges by exploring the role of the cc tradition as a form of social capital in fostering sustainable tourism development. A qualitative case study approach was employed, incorporating in-depth interviews, participatory observations, and focus group discussions (FGDs). The findings highlight that the sustainable development of tourism in Poto Village is contingent upon three critical factors: the enhancement of infrastructure, the implementation of targeted promotional campaigns, and the active participation of the local community in preserving and promoting their cultural heritage. Furthermore, it was observed that the Ponan tradition serves as a vital mechanism for community empowerment, fostering a sense of ownership and pride among villagers while simultaneously attracting cultural tourism. The study underscores the importance of adopting a holistic approach to tourism management that harmonizes economic objectives with cultural preservation and community well-being. By offering actionable insights, this research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable tourism and cultural studies, providing a framework for policymakers and practitioners to develop inclusive and culturally sensitive tourism strategies. However, the study is limited by its regional focus and qualitative methodology, suggesting the need for future research to explore broader applications of local wisdom in tourism development across diverse cultural contexts.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The Ponan tradition represents a vital form of social capital and local wisdom within the farming community of Poto Village, Moyo Hilir District, Sumbawa Regency. This tradition is practiced following the planting season when the rice plants reach one month of age, serving as a symbolic expression of gratitude for the harvest and hope for a bountiful yield. The enduring uniqueness of this tradition showcases the rich local culture that has been preserved over time, underscoring the significance of customary and cultural values in the daily lives of Poto Village residents. The collective participation in the Ponan tradition reflects strong social cohesion and a deep sense of community, highlighting the valuable social capital that supports the sustainability of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Rocca &amp;amp; Zielinski, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, this tradition has become a notable tourist attraction, appealing to local and international visitors eager to observe and experience its distinctive cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Pérez-Priego et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The implementation of the Ponan tradition engages the entire village community, underscoring the enduring values of unity and cooperation in everyday life. Each resident, from the youth to community leaders and farmers, plays a specific role and assumes responsibilities in the preparation and execution of the tradition. This collective participation not only enhances social solidarity but also strengthens interpersonal bonds, fostering a high level of harmony and social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Inglehart &amp;amp; Baker, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the tradition serves as a vehicle for preserving cultural values and customs that have been transmitted across generations, ensuring the continued vibrancy and relevance of the local culture in contemporary society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Taute et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The Ponan tradition is distinguished by its unique and symbolic execution, which embodies a harmonious relationship between humans and nature. This tradition is typically marked by various ceremonial practices, traditional dances, and significant religious rituals, showcasing the integration of spiritual and social elements in community life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Mayseless &amp;amp; Kizel, 2022</xref>). Its distinctive nature not only captivates tourists but also attracts researchers and scholars seeking deeper insights into local cultural practices. Visitors to the Ponan tradition not only experience a visual spectacle but also gain an understanding of its underlying values, enhancing their awareness and appreciation of the local culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The Ponan tradition has garnered widespread acclaim and attracts domestic and international tourists eager to experience its unique cultural elements firsthand. Its status as a cultural tourism attraction has significantly increased visitor numbers to Poto Village, bringing notable economic benefits to the local community. Tourists not only enjoy cultural performances but also participate in daily community activities, such as visiting weaving centers and sampling local cuisine. This engagement generates new economic opportunities for residents, particularly for micro-entrepreneurs like weavers and food vendors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Rembulan et al., 2023</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Sulthony et al. (2023)</xref> suggests that culture-based tourism can drive sustainable economic development and improve the well-being of local communities.</p><p>The Ponan tradition incurs substantial costs, which, from an economic perspective, elevate the production expenses for farmers. These costs encompass various aspects, including ceremony preparation, materials, and the involvement of local labor. Such financial demands often impose an additional burden on farmers, who must invest extra resources to maintain the tradition. Nonetheless, the tradition persists due to its significant cultural and social value. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Raz et al. (2024)</xref> suggests that, despite the high economic costs, the cultural and social importance of a tradition frequently serves as a critical factor in its continued practice. Despite these challenges, the Ponan tradition is maintained due to its significant cultural and social importance. It is considered an essential element of the cultural identity of the Poto Village community, embodying the enduring values of unity and mutual support. These values, although not quantifiable in monetary terms, greatly contribute to social cohesion and community stability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Ding &amp;amp; Doan (2023)</xref> suggested that the cultural and social benefits of such traditions can offer long-term advantages to the community, even if they present short-term economic burdens.</p><p>The central issue is finding a balance between cultural preservation and the economic costs associated with it. While it is essential to preserve the Ponan tradition as a cherished cultural heritage, the associated high costs can place a financial strain on the community, particularly on farmers facing economic difficulties in their agricultural pursuits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Zhou et al. (2022)</xref> highlighted the necessity of a balanced approach to cultural preservation—one that maintains traditional values while also addressing the economic challenges confronted by the community.</p><p>The Ponan tradition holds considerable potential as a cultural tourism attraction with the capacity to generate positive economic impacts for the local community. Cultural tourism has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in boosting local revenue and promoting cultural heritage. By marketing the Ponan tradition as a tourist attraction, Poto Village could draw more visitors, thereby enhancing income from the tourism sector. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Moayerian et al. (2022)</xref> suggested that cultural tourism development can provide a sustainable solution for supporting the local economy while simultaneously preserving traditional practices. This situation creates a need for further research to comprehensively understand the economic and social impacts of implementing the Ponan tradition. Detailed studies are necessary to evaluate how the tradition can be developed as a tourism attraction while preserving its cultural and social values. Additionally, research should investigate strategies to reduce the economic burden on farmers while enhancing the economic benefits derived from tourism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Wang &amp;amp; Zhang (2020)</xref> argued that a holistic approach, engaging various stakeholders, is crucial to overcoming these challenges and ensuring that the tradition can make a positive contribution to sustainable development.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to explore and analyze the social and economic impacts of the implementation of the Ponan Tradition in Poto Village, Moyo Hilir Sub-district, Sumbawa Regency, focusing on its role as social capital and cultural tourism attraction. This research aims to understand how the tradition contributes to the preservation of local cultural values, strengthens togetherness and social solidarity, and improves the economic welfare of the local community through the tourism sector. In addition, the research also aims to identify strategies that can be used to reduce the economic burden borne by farmers in carrying out this tradition, while ensuring its preservation as an important cultural heritage.</p><p>This study aims to provide new insights into the integration of the Ponan tradition into sustainable economic and social development strategies. The findings are anticipated to offer actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders to foster the development of the Ponan tradition as a cultural tourism attraction. Additionally, the research seeks to determine the optimal balance between cultural preservation and economic development, ensuring that the Ponan tradition is preserved and continues to benefit the community of Poto Village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Ma &amp;amp; Ouyang, 2023</xref>).</p><p>For these reasons, this research contributes significantly to the fields of economics and tourism, as well as to the preservation of local culture and the improvement of community well-being. It is expected to enhance the understanding of how the Ponan Tradition can be effectively incorporated into sustainable development strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Zawilińska et al. (2023)</xref> emphasized that a holistic approach involving diverse stakeholders is crucial for ensuring that cultural traditions deliver sustainable economic and social benefits. Moreover, the findings of this study may serve as a model for other regions with similar cultural tourism potential.</p><p>Through a comprehensive analysis and well-grounded recommendations, this research has the potential to assist other regions in leveraging and preserving local traditions as a focal point for cultural tourism. Consequently, the outcomes of this study are not only advantageous for Poto Village but also contribute significantly to the broader development of cultural tourism across Indonesia. As posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Cranmer et al. (2023)</xref>, case studies on cultural tourism development offer critical insights for crafting sustainable and inclusive tourism strategies. The investigation into the Ponan tradition in Poto Village is particularly pivotal, addressing a crucial gap in research concerning social capital and indigenous wisdom among farming communities in Indonesia. The Ponan tradition—a ceremonial expression of gratitude for the harvest and a hopeful invocation for future abundance—embodies rich cultural values and underscores the profound integration of spiritual and social dimensions within the fabric of the local community.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>In a pivotal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Gutierrez (2023)</xref>, the intricate relationship between participation and empowerment within community-based tourism (CBT) was meticulously examined. The research introduces a refined participation-empowerment model, positing that sustained interactions are crucial in amplifying community participation and empowerment. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Moayerian et al. (2022)</xref> delved into the role of community-driven cultural practices in bolstering community capacity and the sustainability of tourism. Their research, set in an industrial town in Central Appalachia, underscores the imperative of robust local engagement in the decision-making processes related to tourism.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abouelmagd (2023)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Khizar et al. (2023)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Skanavis &amp;amp; Sakellari (2008)</xref> critically explored the formulation of eco-cultural trails within the paradigm of sustainable tourism. The study adopts a qualitative methodology underpinned by stakeholder engagement, incorporating two focus groups and workshops with a diverse array of participants, including representatives from governmental bodies, private enterprises, academia, students, and environmental organizations. Utilizing the “Seven Hanging Valleys” trail as a case study, the research delineates strategies for the development and management of eco-cultural trails. Informed by stakeholder perspectives, the study proposes a comprehensive development and management plan that synergizes environmental objectives aimed at conserving cultural and natural heritage with the enhancement of the overall experiential quality for both travelers and local communities.</p><p>The aforementioned studies offer a range of methodologies for addressing sustainability challenges within the framework of community-based tourism. A unifying theme across these investigations is their emphasis on community capacity building and the sustainable stewardship of resources. However, each study is distinguished by its unique context and focus, spanning from community engagement to waste management strategies. This discourse exemplifies how diverse methods and approaches can be employed to address the particular challenges that communities encounter within the domain of sustainable tourism.</p><p>The principal commonality between this study and prior research lies in its focus on the development of culture-based and community-centric tourism, with a particular emphasis on the pivotal role of social capital and the preservation of local cultural heritage. However, the distinguishing factors pertain to the geographical and cultural contexts, as well as the methodologies employed. This research specifically examines the Ponan tradition in Poto Village, adopting a qualitative approach that underscores case studies and local community participation. This approach diverges from the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Rahman et al. (2020)</xref>, which utilized structural equation modeling, and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Wang &amp;amp; Zhang (2020)</xref>, which employed hierarchical analysis.</p><p>Accordingly, this study addresses a critical gap in the literature by illuminating how the Ponan tradition can be cultivated as a sustainable cultural tourism attraction, while also offering novel insights into the role of social capital and community involvement in cultural preservation and local economic development. The findings of this research are anticipated to provide substantive recommendations for the advancement of sustainable and inclusive cultural tourism, thereby enhancing the well-being of the Poto Village community.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>The Results section may be divided into subsections. It should describe the results concisely and precisely, provide their interpretation, and draw possible conclusions from the results.</p><p>This study adopts a qualitative method with a case study approach to investigate the potential of the Ponan tradition as a cultural tourism attraction and its economic implications for Poto Village, Moyo Hilir District, Sumbawa Regency. This method was chosen to facilitate a profound understanding of the phenomenon, emphasizing the contextual and social dynamics that shape the Ponan tradition. Qualitative research methods further enable the exploration of meanings and perceptions from a diverse range of stakeholders involved in the tradition, including residents, stakeholders, and tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Haq et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The research employs qualitative data, encompassing primary and secondary sources. Primary data was acquired through in-depth interviews with selected informants, participatory observation during the Ponan tradition, and FGDs with the local community. Secondary data was sourced from a variety of documents, including relevant reports, prior research, journal articles, and pertinent literature. The integration of primary and secondary data aimed to yield a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the Ponan tradition and its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Mayseless &amp;amp; Kizel, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The utilized data collection methods encompassed in-depth interviews, participatory observation, and FGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alemu, 2023</xref>). In-depth interviews were conducted with a diverse array of stakeholders possessing expertise in the Ponan tradition, including community leaders, youth, local entrepreneurs, and regional government officials. Participatory observation involved immersive engagement with the Ponan tradition to gain insight into the procedural, activity-based, and social dynamics at play during the event. Additionally, FGDs were organized to elicit varied perspectives and opinions from different community factions regarding the potential of the Ponan tradition as a cultural tourism attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Moayerian et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this research, in-depth interviews and FGDs were conducted to explore the perspectives of various stakeholders regarding the potential and impact of the Ponan tradition as a cultural tourism attraction. Interview questions that can be asked include ‘How do you perceive the role of the Ponan tradition in the social and economic life of the Poto Village community?’ and ‘What are the biggest challenges faced by the community in maintaining the Ponan tradition as part of the local culture?’ In FGDs, the prompts included ‘What benefits do you feel from implementing the Ponan tradition, both socially and economically?’ and ‘How do you think the Ponan tradition can be developed to attract more tourists without sacrificing cultural values?’ Thematic analysis was applied by identifying themes that emerge from interviews, observations, and FGDs to find relevant patterns and meanings, such as community perceptions towards tradition preservation, the economic impact of tourism, and the social values preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Rocca &amp;amp; Zielinski, 2022</xref>). This process involves data reduction to filter out relevant information, data presentation to systematically display the findings, and verification to ensure the reliability of the findings, using NVivo software to organize the data and R Studio and Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize maps of the research sites, aiming to improve the rigor and reliability of the analysis.</p>

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>This research provides important insights for the development of sustainable tourism in Poto Village by highlighting several challenges and opportunities that must be addressed to optimize the potential of culture-based tourism. One of the key findings is the importance of strengthening infrastructure and more effective tourism promotion, two factors that strongly influence tourist attraction. The results of this study underscore the need for close collaboration between the local government, local communities, and the private sector to develop adequate basic infrastructure, as well as to introduce Poto Village more widely through innovative promotional strategies. Furthermore, the research shows that quality tourism education and local community empowerment, particularly in the preservation of Ponan traditions, are important aspects of creating an authentic and sustainable tourism experience. Training programs that focus on tourism skills can empower communities to be actively involved in destination management while preserving cultural values.</p><p>The contribution of this research to community-based tourism theory and practice lies in a deeper understanding of how the tourism sector can integrate cultural development and local economic empowerment without undermining traditional values. The findings enrich sustainable tourism theory by identifying the importance of maintaining a balance between cultural preservation and tourism development. In practice, this research provides clear guidelines for policymakers and industry players in designing strategies that support inclusive and sustainable tourism development, which can improve the welfare of local communities, create jobs, and maintain environmental and cultural sustainability. A holistic approach, involving infrastructure strengthening, cultural promotion, and community empowerment, is expected to position Poto Village as a superior and competitive tourism destination in the future.</p>

      <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, the potential diagram for Poto Village elucidates that the agricultural sector stands out as one of the most viable in terms of its vast potential and the challenges it confronts. Within this framework, agriculture necessitates particular scrutiny due to its pivotal role in the village’s economic structure. The predominant challenges in this sector encompass deficiencies in irrigation infrastructure, limited availability of high-quality seeds, and scant agricultural technology. Scholars observe that advancing agricultural development in Poto Village could substantially enhance the socio-economic well-being of the local populace. Accordingly, strategic recommendations for this sector include fortifying the irrigation infrastructure, provisioning superior seeds, and facilitating training in contemporary agricultural technologies.</p><p>Furthermore, the arts-and-culture sector in Poto Village reveals considerable potential, especially concerning the preservation and enhancement of indigenous traditions. The village’s cultural heritage, abundant with traditional values and native wisdom, offers a distinct allure for the advancement of cultural tourism. The sector faces challenges including inadequate cultural promotion, scant supporting infrastructure, and minimal involvement of younger generations in sustaining traditions. The researchers advocate for the augmentation of cultural promotion initiatives and the establishment of supportive facilities, such as local museums or cultural centers, to amplify the cultural prominence of Poto Village. Moreover, fostering active participation from the local community, particularly the youth, in cultural conservation efforts remains a pivotal element of these endeavors.</p><p>The Poto Village community plays a pivotal role in underpinning various economic and social sectors. The community’s potential is evidenced by the robust solidarity among its members, which fosters collaboration across a spectrum of domains, from agriculture to environmental stewardship. Nevertheless, the community encounters challenges such as restricted access to education, healthcare, and economic prospects. Researchers underscore the necessity of bolstering community capacity through empowerment initiatives aimed at augmenting educational and vocational skills. Furthermore, the establishment of synergistic networks between the community and local governance is considered indispensable for addressing these multifaceted issues.</p><p>The culinary sector in Poto Village harbors considerable potential, particularly in the advancement of local gastronomic products that could function as tourist attractions. The village’s unique culinary offerings possess significant economic value that can be leveraged through small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Challenges confronting this sector include constrained market access, inadequate capital, and a deficiency in knowledge regarding effective product packaging. The researchers advocate for the establishment of training programs for local entrepreneurs, emphasizing business management and marketing acumen. Moreover, the creation of cooperatives or collaborative business ventures is posited as a means to bolster the competitiveness of Poto Village’s culinary products in broader markets.</p><p>The environmental conditions in Poto Village necessitate focused attention, particularly concerning the preservation of natural habitats and resources. The village’s environmental potential is characterized by its rich biodiversity and relatively intact natural resources. Nevertheless, challenges arise from deleterious agricultural practices and illicit deforestation. The researchers advocate for adopting sustainable agricultural techniques and reforestation initiatives to uphold ecological equilibrium. Furthermore, fostering heightened community awareness about environmental conservation is imperative, which can be achieved through comprehensive environmental education programs within schools and local community groups.</p><p>Finally, the infrastructure and economic sectors of the village exhibit a confluence of challenges and opportunities. Essential infrastructure—such as roads, bridges, and public amenities—requires substantial enhancement and further development. These infrastructural deficits exert a direct influence on the village’s economic progression, particularly concerning accessibility and the distribution of agricultural outputs. The researchers emphasize the necessity of investing in fundamental infrastructure improvements to catalyze economic development in Poto Village. Recommendations for this sector include the fortification and upkeep of infrastructure, as well as the augmentation of access to technology and information to bolster the economic productivity of the local populace.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> shows the potential and priority scale for tourism development in Poto Village, respectively. Tourism development in Poto Village encounters predominant challenges in infrastructure and promotion, accounting for nearly 20% of the total identified impediments. The deficiency in adequate infrastructure, including roads, public amenities, and accessibility, constitutes a significant barrier to augmenting the tourist influx to Poto Village. Furthermore, suboptimal promotional strategies impede the village’s potential for broader recognition at both national and international levels. To overcome these obstacles, concerted efforts from both local authorities and the community are imperative to enhance infrastructure and devise more cohesive promotional strategies. Consequently, Poto Village can bolster its competitiveness as an enticing and accessible tourist destination.</p><p>In addition to the challenges of infrastructure and promotion, tourism education and the cultivation of local attractions also emerge as pivotal areas of focus, each representing approximately 15% of the total identified issues. Tourism education is indispensable for imparting the requisite knowledge and skills to the local populace, ensuring their effective participation in the tourism sector. Due to the absence of adequate educational frameworks, the latent potential of Poto Village as a tourist destination may remain inadequately harnessed, thereby precluding residents from seizing active engagement opportunities within the industry. Furthermore, local tourist attractions, encompassing both natural splendor and distinctive cultural elements, necessitate further enhancement to evolve into significant draws for visitors. Consequently, the advancement of tourism education and the strategic development of local attractions should be prioritized and executed with alacrity.</p>

      <p>The preservation of cultural heritage in Poto Village, with a particular emphasis on safeguarding Ponan heritage and traditions, constitutes a fundamental aspect of the village’s tourism development strategy. Cultural heritage represents a significant asset capable of augmenting the appeal of tourism; however, its sustainability frequently faces threats from modernization and societal transformations. The challenge inherent in preserving local culture involves not only the conservation of traditions but also their integration within the framework of sustainable tourism. Ponan traditions, as integral components of Poto Village’s cultural identity, should be both preserved and showcased as distinctive tourist attractions. Through the implementation of strategic measures, the preservation of cultural heritage can advance concurrently with tourism development, thereby promoting a symbiotic relationship that benefits both spheres.</p><p>In addition to the conservation of cultural heritage, the advancement of Ponan traditions is also a principal priority for the enhancement of tourism in Poto Village. Ponan traditions, which encompass a myriad of social and cultural dimensions, possess the potential to evolve into captivating tourist attractions. However, their development necessitates a nuanced approach that honors local values and cultural sagacity. It is imperative to ensure that the advancement of these traditions does not compromise the essence and integrity of the preexisting culture. The researchers underscore the importance of engaging the local community at every phase of development to preserve the authenticity of Ponan traditions, thereby enabling tourists to experience them without diminishing their intrinsic significance.</p><p>The economic and communal empowerment of the Ponan community is also recognized as an important domain in the advancement of tourism in Poto Village, reaching 30-40%. Economic empowerment through tourism has the potential to confer tangible benefits to the local populace, including augmented income and employment prospects. However, achieving this necessitates substantial support in the form of specialized training, access to financial resources, and the cultivation of SMEs centered on local products. The Ponan community, which plays an integral role in the preservation of traditions and culture, must be empowered to engage actively in tourism development. With appropriate backing, this community can emerge as a principal contributor to the creation of authentic and sustainable tourism experiences in Poto Village.</p><p>Overall, the development of tourism in Poto Village necessitates a comprehensive and synergistic approach, given the multifaceted nature of the challenges at hand. Each critical domain—ranging from infrastructure, promotion, and tourism education to cultural conservation and community empowerment—is interconnected and demands equitable attention. The efficacy of tourism development in Poto Village hinges substantially on the capacity to adeptly navigate these challenges. With judicious strategies and the proactive involvement of all stakeholders, Poto Village has the potential to transform into an eminent tourist destination that not only augments the economic prosperity of the local populace but also safeguards its cultural patrimony. The insights derived from this study offer strategic directives that can be utilized by policymakers and industry professionals to optimize the tourism potential of Poto Village sustainably.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study elucidates that the advancement of tourism in Poto Village encounters a spectrum of interrelated challenges, particularly in the realms of infrastructure, promotion, tourism education, cultural preservation, and community empowerment. Deficient infrastructure and suboptimal promotional strategies represent the principal impediments that necessitate prompt rectification to augment the tourism appeal of Poto Village. Furthermore, enhancing tourism education and cultivating local attractions are pivotal for empowering the local populace and fully harnessing tourism potential. Prioritizing cultural preservation and the protection of Ponan traditions is imperative to mitigate the erosion of the village’s cultural heritage caused by modernization. Economic and communal empowerment of the Ponan people is also vital to ensure that the advantages of tourism development are distributed equitably among the local community.</p><p>This research revealed that tourism development in Poto Village faces a variety of interrelated challenges, such as limited infrastructure, ineffective promotion, and an urgent need to improve tourism education and local cultural preservation. In this context, infrastructure development and a more integrated promotional strategy are key to enhancing Poto Village's tourism appeal. In addition, the development of local attractions that capitalize on Ponan's rich culture and traditions, as well as the empowerment of local communities, were identified as important factors to ensure economic sustainability through tourism. These findings provide a significant theoretical contribution in community-based tourism management, where aspects of infrastructure, promotion, cultural preservation, and community empowerment must be managed simultaneously to achieve optimal success.</p><p>Theoretically, these findings constitute a substantial advancement in the domain of tourism management and cultural preservation. This research augments the corpus of literature concerning the interplay between infrastructure development, promotional strategies, and tourism education, and their impact on the efficacy of local cultural preservation within the framework of tourism development. The results also highlight the imperative of adopting a holistic paradigm for tourism advancement, wherein disparate elements must be managed synergistically to attain optimal outcomes.</p><p>Practically, these insights offer valuable guidance for policymakers, local authorities, and tourism industry practitioners in formulating sustainable tourism development strategies for Poto Village and its adjacent areas. Recommendations derived from this study, including infrastructure amelioration, cohesive promotional tactics, and enhanced tourism education, should be enacted to surmount prevailing challenges. Furthermore, the findings underscore the critical importance of engaging the local community throughout all phases of tourism development, thereby empowering them to actively participate in the preservation and promotion of their cultural heritage.</p><p>This research identifies the challenges faced by Poto Village in tourism development, which include limited infrastructure, ineffective promotion, poor tourism education and local attraction development. Poor infrastructure, such as inadequate roads and a lack of public facilities, is a major obstacle to the village's tourism development. In addition, suboptimal tourism promotion hinders the introduction of Poto Village to the domestic and international traveler market. The research also found that the preservation of local culture, especially the Ponan tradition, needs to be prioritized to ensure that unique cultural values are maintained despite the influence of tourism. In addition, the economic empowerment of local communities, particularly the Ponan community, is crucial to ensure that the economic benefits of tourism can be enjoyed equitably. The findings provide strategic guidance for sustainable tourism development, with recommendations that include infrastructure improvements, more effective promotion strategies, improved tourism education, attraction development and cultural preservation that are sensitive to the needs of local communities.</p>

      <title>7. Research limitations and future research directions</title>
      <p>Although this study imparts significant insights, several limitations warrant recognition. Primarily, the research is confined to Poto Village, which may render the findings less broadly applicable to other regions with disparate conditions. Additionally, the study predominantly focuses on qualitative analysis, which, while providing profound understanding, may lack the comprehensive scope offered by quantitative methods. Consequently, future research should consider broadening the geographical scope or integrating more meticulous quantitative methodologies to enhance and corroborate these findings.</p><p>For future research, it is recommended to delve deeper into the interplay between technological advancement and cultural preservation within the realm of tourism. Additionally, studies could concentrate on devising effective community engagement models that sustain equilibrium between economic development and the conservation of environmental and cultural heritage. Subsequent investigations are expected to yield a more nuanced understanding and pioneering solutions to the challenges encountered in tourism management and cultural preservation.</p><p>This study has elucidated that the advancement of tourism in Poto Village necessitates a holistic approach, integrating diverse facets such as infrastructure, promotion, education, cultural preservation, and community empowerment. The identified predominant challenges include inadequate infrastructure and suboptimal promotional strategies, which may constrain the expansion of the tourism sector. To mitigate these challenges, it is imperative to devise strategies that encompass infrastructure enhancement and the fortification of promotional efforts sustainably. Furthermore, the elevation of tourism education is essential to empower the local populace, facilitating their active engagement in tourism development. Consequently, the progression of tourism in Poto Village can be rendered more efficacious and confer greater benefits to the local community.</p><p>Conversely, the preservation of Ponan culture and traditions should be an unequivocal priority in the tourism development strategy for Poto Village. This study accentuates the necessity of engaging the local community at each phase of development to ensure that cultural traditions and heritage are meticulously preserved while leveraging tourism potential to bolster the community’s economic prosperity. Although this research is subject to certain constraints, such as its regional focus and qualitative methodology, the findings still provide a substantial contribution to the evolution of theoretical and practical approaches within the tourism domain. Future investigations are encouraged to delve deeper into the nexus between technological innovation and cultural preservation, as well as to devise more efficacious models of community engagement. Such exploration is anticipated to yield more inventive and sustainable solutions to the challenges encountered in tourism management and cultural preservation in Poto Village and analogous locales.</p><p>This study offers a substantial contribution to the corpus of literature on tourism management and cultural preservation, particularly within the context of rural locales such as Poto Village. The findings accentuate the necessity of a comprehensive approach that amalgamates various dimensions of tourism management, encompassing infrastructure, promotion, cultural preservation, and community empowerment. In the academic sphere, this research enhances the comprehension of the interconnections among these elements and establishes a groundwork for subsequent investigations that may examine analogous methodologies in diverse settings. Furthermore, the study underscores the pivotal role of tourism education in fortifying the local community, thereby augmenting their competitiveness in the perpetually evolving tourism sector.</p>
