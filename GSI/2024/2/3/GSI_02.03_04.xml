      <abstract><p>Corrosion-induced damage significantly impairs the seismic performance of steel frame columns, leading to an increased vulnerability during earthquake events. To address this issue, a restoring force model was developed to accurately describe the seismic behaviour of corroded steel columns. Low-cycle repeated loading tests were conducted on corroded steel frame columns to evaluate the effects of corrosion and earthquake-induced damage on their seismic performance. The results revealed distinct degradation patterns, which were systematically analyzed. A cyclic degradation index was proposed to quantify the impact of corrosion on critical parameters, including yield strength, hardening stiffness, unloading stiffness, and reloading stiffness. This index was incorporated into a damage model, which facilitated the formulation of a comprehensive restoring force model for corroded steel frame columns. The developed model was validated through case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the seismic response of corroded columns. The findings underscore the importance of considering corrosion damage in the assessment and design of steel frame columns subjected to seismic loading, providing a more accurate and reliable approach for seismic performance evaluation.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Corrosion is one of the primary factors affecting the durability of steel structures. It degrades the mechanical properties of steel, reduces the cross-sectional area of components, and ultimately leads to a significant deterioration in the load-bearing capacity and seismic performance of steel structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Despite many anti-corrosion measures, the aging steel frames exposed in an aggressive corrosion environment still suffer serious corrosion, especially the exterior components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] investigated the hysteretic behavior of corroded steel under cyclic loading and ultimately established a plastic constitutive model for corroded steel. The results showed that corrosion reduces the strength, ductility, and hysteretic energy of steel. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] also studied the seismic performance of corroded steel columns. The results showed that corrosion causes the steel columns to enter various stages prematurely, worsening the buckling deformation range and reducing the load-carrying capacity and energy dissipation. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] and Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] studied the seismic performance of corroded steel frame columns in marine atmospheric environments. The results showed that corrosion significantly reduces the bending capacity and ductility of the columns, leading to a more severe degradation of strength and stiffness. Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] conducted low-cycle fatigue loading tests to study the seismic performance of corroded steel columns. The results showed that as the degree of corrosion increases, the deformed area of the flange and web decreases, leading to a reduction in the ultimate bearing capacity and stiffness of the steel columns.</p><p>A restoring force model refers to a model that simplifies the key properties of the restoring force curve obtained from experiments using mathematical methods. This model is an essential tool for performing elastic-plastic analysis and dynamic time-history analysis of structures or components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Currently, the research on restoring force models for steel structures or components is well-established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], but studies focusing on the restoring force characteristics of existing or corroded steel structures or components remain scarce. Several studies have examined the restoring force characteristics of corroded steel frame beams in acidic atmospheres and established a hysteresis skeleton curve model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Compared to beams, columns play a more crucial role in the seismic performance of steel frame structures. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a restoring force model for steel frame columns that can reflect damage due to corrosion. Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] investigated the seismic behavior of steel frame columns with varying degrees of corrosion through cyclic loading tests. It was found that the seismic resistance of corroded steel frame columns decreases as the degree of corrosion increases. Moreover, the hysteretic curves and those curves of skeleton, strength degradation, stiffness degradation, and hysteretic energy dissipation of corroded frame columns differ significantly from those of the non-corroded frame. To more accurately describe the seismic behavior of corroded steel frame columns, there is an urgent need for a restoring force model that specifically addresses these structures. This model would help in understanding how corrosion affects the seismic performance of steel columns, including changes in their strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capabilities.</p><p>In light of this, based on the conclusions drawn from the low-cycle loading tests of steel frame columns with varying degrees of corrosion reported in the study by Zheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], the effects of coupled seismic and corrosion damage on the seismic behavior of steel frame columns were considered. This study builds upon the damage index-based restoring force model proposed by Takeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. A method for determining the cyclic degradation index of corroded steel frame columns was developed based on the damage model of such columns. Subsequently, the bilinear restoring force model was refined, leading to the establishment of a restoring force model specifically for corroded steel frame columns. This advancement aims to provide a more precise tool for evaluating the seismic performance of corroded steel structures, taking into account the complex interactions between corrosion and seismic forces.</p>

          <p>Steel frame columns with HW250×250×9×14 cross-section were designed in the test. In order to ensure the failure of the frame columns during the test, a bottom beam with larger rigidity was made at the bottom of the columns. Q235 steel was used for section steel specimens and steel plates. The section size of the specimens is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>In order to obtain the steel frame columns with different corrosion degrees, the columns need to be corroded. Due to the long period of the actual atmospheric exposure test, in order to shorten the test time and truly predict the steel corrosion to a certain extent, indoor accelerated corrosion method was used in the test. The acid atmospheric corrosion test of all specimens in this test was conducted in the ZHT / W 2300 climate simulation experiment system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

      <title>4. Establishment of the restoring force model considering damage</title>
      <p>The damage restoring force model, which has gained recognition and widespread use, is a restoring force model based on a damage index proposed by Takeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] in 1978, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. This model is characterized by the yield point not being constant but decreasing as the damage degree increases, pointing to the latest yield point under reverse loading. This feature allows the model to effectively describe the impact of seismic damage on the seismic performance of structures.</p>

      <p>Using the characteristics of the above-mentioned damage restoring force model for reference, based on the experimental results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] and the damage model of corroded steel frame structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], the bilinear restoring force model was improved from two aspects of skeleton curve and hysteretic rule. Finally, the restoring force model of corroded steel frame columns considering damage was established.</p>

            <title>4.1. Determination of skeleton curve</title>
          
          <p>By comparing the skeleton curves of steel frame columns with different corrosion degrees, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], it can be observed that while the skeleton curves of corroded and non-corroded components are similar, the extent of performance degradation under cyclic loading differs, leading to variations in the model parameter values. The differences in the skeleton curve model parameters between corroded and non-corroded components are reflected below. Compared to non-corroded components, the strength and stiffness of corroded components degrade more rapidly under seismic loads. The deformation capacity and the energy dissipation ability of corroded components are reduced. As the degree of corrosion increases, these phenomena become progressively more pronounced. Ultimately, the failure mode of the component shifts from ductile to brittle failure.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> shows the hysteresis curves of steel frame columns with different degrees of corrosion. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, the hysteretic loops of all steel frame columns are basically close to the spindle shape. The hysteretic curves under cyclic horizontal loading are essentially symmetrical and can be basically divided into two parts: the yielding stage and the limit stage. Compared with non-corroded steel frame columns, the hysteretic loops of the corroded ones are flatter, and the energy dissipation capacity is lower. Before yielding, the loading and unloading curves of the specimens are almost close to the straight line, and the slope of the straight line is almost constant. The slopes of the loading and unloading curves are the initial stiffness and the unloading stiffness, with the initial stiffness being basically the same as the unloading stiffness. When the specimens are yielding, the loading and unloading curves of the hysteresis loops have the following characteristics:</p><p>a) Loading curve: When the specimen is yielding, the slope of the loading curve (i.e., the load stiffness) decreases with the increase of the cycle number and the increase of the displacement amplitude, and the magnitude of the decrease increases gradually. Comparison of the hysteretic curves of specimens with different corrosion degrees shows that the curve slope decreases with the increase of corrosion degree under the same loading cycle times, which indicates that the attenuation rate of the specimen’s stiffness increases with the increase of corrosion degree.</p><p>b) Unloading curve: When the specimen is yielding, the slope of unloading curve (i.e., unloading stiffness of specimen) decreases with the increase of the cycle number and the increase of the displacement amplitude. After complete unloading, there is a residual deformation in the specimen. In the unloading curve of the same direction, the residual deformation after the latter unloading is larger than the residual deformation after the previous unloading. Compared to the non-corroded steel column, the residual deformation of corroded steel frame columns is larger.</p>

          <p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>, the steel column has undergone three processes throughout the loading and unloading cycle, namely, elastic (0-1, 3-4, 6-7, 9-10), strengthening (1-2, 5-4, 7-8, 10-11), and unloading (2-3, 5-6, 8-9, 11-12). The corresponding stiffness of the above three stages is the initial stiffness (or loading stiffness), hardening stiffness and unloading stiffness.</p><p>As can be seen from the hysteresis curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, with the increase of loading cycle times and the increase of horizontal displacement amplitude, the loading stiffness, hardening stiffness, unloading stiffness, yield load and peak load of the specimens are continuously reduced. Therefore, in order to obtain the complete hysteretic curve of corroded steel frame columns, the degradation of the specimens' properties should be determined.</p>

          <p>Through the description of the degradation law of corroded steel frame columns, the restoring force model of corroded steel frame columns based on damage was obtained, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>.</p>
          <p>The hysteretic rule of corroded steel frame columns is as follows:</p><p>(a) The loading and unloading of corroded steel frame columns are carried out along the elastic section of the skeleton curve (i.e., 0-1 stage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>) before yielding.</p><p>(b) The first loading cycle of corroded steel frame columns after yielding is presented below. The loading stiffness of the 0-1 stage is taken as the loading stiffness at the elastic stage during forward loading, and the corresponding load value at point 1 and the hardening stiffness of the 1-2 stage, respectively, take the corresponding yield load and hardening stiffness of the specimen when it is first yielding. When unloading, the unloading stiffness of the 2-3 stage is the same as the loading stiffness of the 0-1 stage. In reverse loading, according to Formula (10), the reverse loading stiffness of the 3-4 stage is the same as the unloading stiffness of the 2-3 stage, and the yield load value of point 4 is the same as the loading value of point 1. However, the direction is opposite. The hardening stiffness of the 4-5 section is the same as that of the 1-2 section. In the reverse unloading stage, the unloading stiffness of the 5-6 stage is equal to the unloading stiffness of the 2-3 stage.</p><p>(c) The second loading cycle after yielding is presented below. According to Formula (11), the loading stiffness of the 6-7 stage is the same as that of the 5-6 unloading stage in the previous cycle loading. The damage model proposed by Karina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] was used to calculate the damage value increment <inline-formula>

The yield load at points 7 and 10, the hardening stiffness of 7-8 and 10-11 stages, and the unloading stiffness of 8-9 and 11-12 stages were calculated by Formulas (7), (8) and (9), respectively.</p><p>The loading cycle of the 3rd, 4th, … , n-th after yielding is the same as that of the second after yielding. When the maximum horizontal bearing capacity of the specimen drops to 0.85 times the ultimate bearing capacity, the loading is stopped.</p>

Specifically, modified tetrahedral solid elements (C3D10M) were chosen, and the element shape is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_14">Figure 14</xref>. This element type is suitable for contact and elastoplastic problems, offering high precision, although it comes with a higher computational cost. It is a commonly used element type for simulating the elastoplastic state of structural members. Ultimately, the element meshing of the test specimens is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_15">Figure 15</xref>.</p><p>The same loading method was employed in this study for the finite element simulation of the test specimens used in the experimental section of the study by Takeda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p>

          <p>Steel materials may experience certain initial deformations during production and transportation, which can be referred to as initial defects of the steel. To perform more accurate finite element simulations of the test specimens and to accurately model the local yielding deformation of the columns, it is necessary to incorporate defect data into the model. The buckling modes of the model were calculated using the Buckle solver command in ABAQUS, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref>. Then, the *IMPERFECTION keyword was used to add imperfection data to the model.</p>

              <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_18">Figure 18</xref>, the trends of the experimental curves and the finite element numerical simulation curves are largely consistent. Upon comparing the hysteresis curves from the finite element simulations, it is evident that the positive and negative hysteresis loops are symmetric about the origin, whereas the experimental curves exhibit discrepancies. In quasi-static tests, as the number of loading cycles increases, the specimens may gradually develop damage and deformation. These damages and deformations can affect the mechanical behavior of the specimens, leading to asymmetry in the hysteresis loops. For example, plastic deformation in the specimens can lead to different energy dissipation capacities during positive and negative loading. Additionally, friction and slip between the loading device and the specimens can affect the stress state and deformation patterns, further contributing to the asymmetry in the hysteresis loops. The hysteresis rules in the finite element simulations presented in this study consider only the effects of earthquake and corrosion damages on the seismic performance of the components, and do not account for potential asymmetry in the positive and negative loading cycles.</p>

From the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>, it can be seen that the relative error between the computed and experimental values for all characteristic points is less than 6.19%, meeting the precision requirements.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>After analyzing and summarizing the skeleton curves of steel frame columns under different corrosion degrees, a restoring force model for corroded steel frame columns was established in this study. Compared to existing models, the innovation of the proposed restoring force model lies in that it is based on the damage model of corroded steel frames by establishing a cyclic degradation index formula. This formula describes the degradation patterns of yield strength, hardening stiffness, unloading stiffness, and reloading stiffness using the cyclic degradation index. The results from case studies demonstrate that the restoring force model developed in this study can effectively describe the seismic performance of corroded steel frame columns under earthquake loads. </p><p>By investigating the performance degradation patterns of corroded steel frame columns, this study revealed the significant impact of corrosion on the seismic performance of structures. These findings are crucial for engineers involved in seismic design, as they highlight the importance of considering corrosion factors in their designs. Engineers can use these insights to implement necessary seismic measures, thereby enhancing the overall seismic capacity of structures.</p><p>The bilinear skeleton curve model and the cyclic degradation index formula developed in this study, which consider corrosion damage, are not only applicable to steel frame columns with specific corrosion degrees but also exhibit broad applicability. By adjusting the parameters in the model, it can be applied to steel frame columns with varying degrees of corrosion and different cross-sectional dimensions and material properties. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the seismic performance of steel structures in corrosive environments. The research methodology presented in this study is not limited to steel frame columns but can be extended to other types of steel structural components, such as steel beams and joints. Using similar research methods, corrosion damage models can be established for various components, thereby further refining the evaluation system for the seismic performance of steel structures in corrosive environments.</p><p>The limitation of this study lies in the fact that the finite element simulation techniques did not adequately account for factors causing asymmetry in the positive and negative hysteresis loops of steel frame columns. Therefore, improvements to the finite element simulation techniques could consider additional influencing factors, such as non-uniform corrosion distribution and variability in material properties, to further investigate how to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the models.</p>
