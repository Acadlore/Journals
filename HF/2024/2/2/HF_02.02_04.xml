      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The literature review presented in this study highlights the transformative impact of AI on healthcare and medical education. Key findings include the necessity of integrating AI literacy into medical curricula, the importance of standardized education programs, and the significant ethical challenges associated with AI implementation, such as algorithmic bias and patient data security. Additionally, this review underscores the potential of AI to enhance healthcare delivery and the critical need for equitable access to AI technologies. Practical strategies for addressing ethical concerns, such as using diverse datasets and transparent algorithmic development, are also emphasized. Moreover, based on the thematic analysis, this study proposes an ethical framework to guide the development and deployment of AI-driven predictive analytics in healthcare. By following these strategies, healthcare systems can uphold ethical standards while leveraging the potential of AI to improve patient care.</p>

      <title>6. Limitations</title>
      <p>This study has the following limitations:</p><p>(a) Scope limitation: Focusing primarily on the intersection of AI-driven predictive analytics, healthcare, and education, the literature review may overlook other important aspects of AI in healthcare or education that are not directly related to predictive analytics.</p><p>(b) Restriction of the publication date: The inclusion criteria specify articles published from 2017 onwards, potentially excluding relevant research published before this period that could provide valuable insights into the topic.</p><p>(c) Language bias: Only articles published in English were considered for inclusion, which may lead to language bias and the exclusion of valuable research published in other languages.</p><p>(d) Publication bias: The emphasis on peer-reviewed sources might introduce publication bias, as it may overlook valuable insights from non-peer-reviewed sources, such as grey literature, conference papers, or reports.</p><p>(e) Geographical bias: The literature review does not mention any specific efforts to include research from diverse geographical regions, which may limit the generalizability of findings and overlook important perspectives from different healthcare and educational systems worldwide.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="">
      <title>7. Recommendations</title>
      <p>This study makes the following recommendations:</p><p>(a) Ethical guidelines could be developed and refined for AI integration in healthcare.</p><p>(b) New ways could be explored to responsibly integrate AI in healthcare settings.</p><p>(c) Empirical studies could be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of standardized AI curricula in various educational settings.</p><p>(d) Longitudinal studies could be performed to assess the long-term impact of AI literacy on healthcare professionalsâ performance and patient outcomes.</p><p>(e) The integration of AI into under-resourced settings could be studied to develop strategies for equitable access.</p><p>(f) Methods to mitigate algorithmic bias and enhance transparency and explain ability in AI systems could be investigated.</p><p>(g) Research could be expanded to include non-English publications for a comprehensive understanding of global advancements and challenges in AI integration in healthcare and education.</p>
