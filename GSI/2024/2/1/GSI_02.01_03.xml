      <abstract>Traditional analyses of tunnel reliability, which employ deformation values, such as surface settlement, crown settlement, and arch shoulder settlement, as instability indicators, fail to accurately depict the failure state of tunnel lining structures. In addressing tunnel instability induced by the failure of lining structures, the limit strain theory is introduced, designating shear strain penetration failure of the lining structure as the criterion for tunnel instability. A novel method for studying tunnel reliability, integrating neural network response surface methodology and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed. The feasibility of the limit strain theory in reliability analysis is validated through the calculation of instability probabilities for specific tunnel projects, offering a fresh perspective on tunnel reliability assessment. Sensitivity analysis of rock mass parameters reveals that an increase in the variability of these parameters elevates the probability of tunnel instability and the shear strain value at the arch waists. Among these parameters, the variability of the modulus of elasticity (E) exerts the most significant impact on the probability of tunnel instability.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The construction of tunnel projects entails significant costs and long service periods, making the study of their stability a subject of widespread interest among scholars both domestically and internationally. A multitude of uncertainties exist in the construction process of tunnel engineering, for which reliability methods offer an effective means of quantitative analysis. Currently, the principal methods for reliability analysis of tunnel engineering include the response surface method, stochastic finite element method, and Monte Carlo method. For instance, Park and Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] proposed a back-analysis method based on the continuous response surface method for identifying geomechanical parameters of rock masses near underground chambers, which boasts high accuracy and computational efficiency in parameter identification. Li and Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] applied the response surface method to study the failure mechanisms of subway tunnels, identifying the impact patterns of both non-random and random variables on the failure probability. Li and Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] introduced an improved response surface method for the reliability analysis of the working face in fractured soft rock tunnels, demonstrating that the stability of the tunnel face is more sensitive to the internal friction angle than to cohesion. Wang and Li [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] developed a stochastic response surface method that considers non-Gaussian random variables under incomplete probability information in tunnel excavation reliability analysis, extending the application scope of the stochastic response surface method. Lyu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] evaluated the failure probability of each failure mode in tunnel systems using the Monte Carlo method and response surface method, finding that reliability primarily depends on the timing of support installation. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] investigated the application of combining multiple response surface methods with the Monte Carlo method in analyzing the reliability of tunnel structures across different failure modes. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] explored the application of the non-intrusive stochastic finite element method in the reliability analysis of deformations in underground chambers. Liu and Low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] employed the neural network response surface method for the reliability analysis of circular tunnels, which proved to be more efficient and accurate compared to the second-order response surface method.</p><p>Currently, scholars commonly employ deformation response values of tunnels, such as crown settlement, arch shoulder settlement, and surface settlement, as indicators for tunnel reliability analysis studies. It is determined that tunnel structures become unstable when deformation values exceed permissible limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. During the operational phase of tunnels, stress concentration occurs around the tunnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. When the surrounding rock stress gradually surpasses the tunnel's load-bearing capacity, the lining may undergo partial or total failure, weakening the tunnel's load-bearing capacity and consequently leading to instability. Therefore, tunnel failure generally lags behind the failure of the lining, and using surface or crown settlement values exceeding permissible limits as the criterion for instability does not effectively represent the tunnel instability phenomena induced by lining failure. Based on the limit strain theory, this article adopts shear strain penetration at the tunnel haunches as the criterion for tunnel structural instability. A new method for tunnel reliability study, integrating neural network response surface methodology and Monte Carlo simulation, is proposed and its feasibility is validated through an engineering case study.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the stress-strain relationship curve for ideal plastic materials. As stress increases, the material initially enters the elastic stage within its load-bearing limit, where strain grows linearly, and the majority of energy absorbed by the material is transformed into elastic energy stored internally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. With further increase in stress, the material exits the elastic stage and enters the initial phase of the plastic stage, at which point the material's stress reaches its peak strength. This state retains certain elastic characteristics, known as the elastic limit state, and the strain at this point, <inline-formula>

However, due to the restraining effect of adjacent elements, the failure of a single element does not lead to macroscopic damage of the material. It is only when the strain values of all elements within a certain area reach the limit strain, thus forming a zone of plastic limit strain penetration, that the material is truly considered to have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].

            <title>2.2. Reliability analysis combining neural network response surface and monte carlo simulation methods</title>
          
          <p>The rationale behind the response surface method involves constructing an easily manageable response surface to substitute the actual complex true function, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Presently, the response surface method primarily comprises polynomial response surface methodology and neural network response surface methodology. The polynomial response surface methodology calculates the true function values for a certain number of regularly selected input variable samples, then fits a mathematical polynomial, using the polynomial function to progressively approximate and substitute the true function as the response surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Neural network response surface methodology calculates the true function values for a large number of input variable samples, utilizing a back propagation (BP) neural network to construct the relationship between variables and the true function values, with the neural network serving as the response surface in place of the true function. When the true function is complex and involves numerous input variables, the neural network response surface offers higher fitting precision and more accurately simulates the true function compared to the polynomial response surface.</p><p>The Monte Carlo method obtains a large number of samples, N, through random sampling and calculates the true function for each sample, tallying the number of unstable samples, M. The ratio M/N represents the probability of instability, P. Compared with traditional Monte Carlo reliability methods, substituting the true function calculation with a neural network response surface allows for the computation of a large volume of samples in a short time, significantly improving Monte Carlo operation efficiency. The research approach involves: numerically simulating a large number of samples to obtain the actual values of the characteristic parameters of the function, then constructing hidden layer neurons, using the computed samples to train the established neural network, obtaining the neural network mapping relationship between input and output parameters. This neural network response surface substitutes the real function's response surface, and finally, reliability analysis is conducted using the Monte Carlo method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], with the specific process as follows:</p><p>(a) The number of random variables for tunnel surrounding rock and their statistical characteristics are determined, obtaining the parameter samples required for constructing the response surface.</p><p>(b) A numerical model of the tunnel is established. For each sample parameter, calculations are conducted individually within the numerical model to obtain the corresponding true response values of characteristic parameters. The training samples for constructing the response surface consist of the random variable values of each sample and the true response values of the characteristic parameters.</p><p>(c) Based on the training samples, a neural network response surface between random variables and characteristic parameters is constructed.</p><p>(d) According to the statistical characteristics of random variables, N random samplings of the random variable values are performed.</p><p>(e) Each set of sampled values is substituted into the constructed neural network response surface to calculate the response values of characteristic parameters.</p><p>(f) Based on the permissible values of characteristic parameters, the number of samples among the N random samplings whose response values exceed permissible values, i.e., the number of unstable samples M, is tallied, with the instability probability being P=M/N.</p>

          <p>The Shilong Tunnel in Chongqing City traverses a ridge mountain range, primarily through Grade IV surrounding rock. The tunnel has a width of 12 m and a height of 10 m, with a burial depth of 150 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. FLAC3D software is employed for the reliability analysis of the tunnel structure, simplifying the tunnel excavation issue into a two-dimensional plane strain model, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. The model dimensions are 140 m in length, 80 m in height, and 2 m in width, with a set burial depth of 40 m. The weight of the overlying 110 m rock mass is applied as an equivalent load on the model's top. C20 concrete is used for the lining, with a thickness of 0.3 m. Specific parameters are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p>

            <title>3.2. Tunnel instability criteria based on limit strain theory</title>
          
          <p>Following the limit strain theory introduced in Section 2.1, a criterion for limit strain failure was proposed, stating, "The failure of certain units in geotechnical engineering indicates local failure of the structure; when limit strain units are interconnected, total failure is achieved." This criterion was applied to the failure of concrete cubic specimens, validating its feasibility for practical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>This study extends the application of this limit strain failure criterion to the failure of tunnel-lining structures. It is considered that a tunnel becomes unstable when the overall shear strain value across the thickness of a certain area of the lining exceeds the limit strain value. The lining in the arch waist area of the tunnel is most prone to damage. Hence, the criterion of limit strain penetration in the tunnel lining's arch waist area is adopted as the indicator of tunnel instability.</p><p>The lining material used for the tunnel is C20 concrete, for which the corresponding limit strain value is identified as 1.06‰ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. According to the established numerical analysis model, strain monitoring points are uniformly placed at the lining's arch waist position. If the shear strain values at any point across the thickness exceed the limit strain of 1.06‰, it is determined that the lining has failed, leading to the tunnel becoming unstable.</p>

            <title>3.3. Comparison between limit strain penetration instability criterion and crown settlement instability criterion</title>
          
          <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> presents a comparison between the shear strain of the tunnel lining and the vertical (Z-direction) displacement for a subset of the calculation samples. In the shear strain contour map, the red areas indicate parts where the shear strain value exceeds the ultimate shear strain of 1.06‰ for C20 concrete, signifying the shear strain failure zone; the blue areas represent sections where the shear strain does not exceed 1.06‰, indicating the non-failure zones. The vertical displacement contour map reveals that the crown settlement of the four samples gradually increases from 0.67 cm to 1.52 cm. Concurrently, the shear strain failure zone begins to develop downwards from the arch waist, eventually extending through the entire area between the arch waist and the arch foot, indicating total shear strain penetration failure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> lists the corresponding lining failure areas and crown settlement values for each sample.</p>

          <p>According to the standard, a control value of 1.5 cm for crown settlement is stipulated for tunnel support structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. In Sample 1, where the tunnel lining did not undergo shear strain penetration failure, the crown settlement was 0.67 cm, not reaching the deformation control value of 1.5 cm. For Sample 2, shear strain penetration failure occurred in the arch waist area at a height of 2-4 m, indicating the onset of tunnel instability, with a crown settlement of 1.05 cm, which did not reach the 1.5 cm deformation control value. In Sample 3, the range of lining damage expanded further, with shear strain penetration failure occurring in the arch waist area at a height of 1.5-5.1 m, indicating a more severe state of tunnel instability, where the crown settlement was 1.24 cm, still below the 1.5 cm deformation control value. For Sample 4, extensive shear strain penetration failure occurred in the arch waist area at a height of 0.9-5.8 m, resulting in a significant loss of the original load-bearing capacity of the lining and severe tunnel instability, with the crown settlement reaching 1.52 cm, exceeding the 1.5 cm tunnel deformation control value. Based on the "1.5 cm deformation control value" stipulated by the standard, only Sample 4 of the tunnel was determined to be unstable, while the other three tunnel samples were considered stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. However, according to the limit strain criterion, the tunnel linings of Samples 2, 3, and 4 all underwent shear strain penetration failure, indicating that Tunnels 2, 3, and 4 were all unstable. Clearly, using the crown settlement control value defined by the standard as the criterion is potentially hazardous, as it incorrectly judges the unstable Tunnel Samples 2 and 3 as stable, a misjudgment that could lead to engineering settlement disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is considered that the limit strain penetration instability criterion is superior to the instability criterion based on the crown settlement control value stipulated by the standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. The limit strain penetration instability criterion not only can predict the safety state of the tunnel in advance but also identifies potential tunnel damage areas, thereby providing a reference for the support design of tunnel engineering.</p>

As the number of samplings increased from 20,000 to 50,000, the fluctuations decreased and gradually stabilized. When the number of samplings exceeded 50,000, the calculated values essentially remained unchanged, indicating convergence. To ensure accuracy of the results, the number of samplings was set to 100,000, ultimately determining the probability of tunnel instability to be 10.90%.</p>

          <p>In actual tunnel engineering, the spatial variability of rock and soil parameters, such as modulus of elasticity, cohesion, and angle of internal friction, is relatively significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. To study the sensitivity of the shear strain values at the tunnel arch waist to these three parameters, 15 working conditions as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref> were designed. The instability probability for each was calculated, and the distribution of shear strain values was analyzed.</p>

Under working condition E_1 (COV=0.1), the distribution range of shear strain values is from 0.4‰ to 1.5‰, with median and 95th percentile values of 0.692‰ and 0.962‰, respectively. Under working condition E_3 (COV=0.2), the distribution range expands to 0.4‰ to 2.3‰, with median and 95th percentile values of 0.698‰ and 1.301‰, respectively. For working condition E_5 (COV=0.3), the range further extends to 0.4‰ to 2.8‰, with median and 95th percentile values of 0.700‰ and 1.832‰, respectively. As the coefficient of variation of the modulus of elasticity E increases, the changes in the size of the shear strain values in the tunnel’s arch waist lining become more pronounced, with the distribution range shifting from the initial 0.4‰ to 1.5‰ to 0.4‰ to 2.8‰.

As the coefficient of variation for cohesion c increases, the distribution of shear strain values across the three conditions does not show significant changes, with the overall distribution range remaining between 0.4‰ and 2.3‰. The median values are respectively 0.691‰, 0.698‰, and 0.706‰, while the 95th percentile values are respectively 1.292‰, 1.313‰, and 1.341‰. This indicates that the size of shear strain values in the tunnel’s arch waist lining is minimally affected by changes in the rock mass's cohesion c. Variations in the rock mass's cohesion c do not significantly alter the size of the shear strain values in the arch waist lining.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The following conclusions have been drawn from this study:</p><p>(a) Based on limit strain theory, with the shear strain penetration of the lining structure as the criterion for tunnel instability, a novel method for tunnel structure reliability analysis combining neural network response surface methodology and Monte Carlo simulation is proposed.</p><p>(b) Compared to using tunnel deformation values as the control indicator for tunnel instability, employing shear strain penetration failure of the tunnel lining as the criterion for instability more effectively determines the unstable state of tunnels, enhancing the accuracy of tunnel reliability analysis.</p><p>(c) The probability of tunnel structure instability increases with the rise in the coefficient of variation of rock mass parameters. Among these, the modulus of elasticity E has the most significant impact on the probability of tunnel structure instability.</p><p>(d) The criterion of shear strain penetration failure for tunnel lining instability more accurately represents phenomena of tunnel structure instability induced by events such as earthquakes and blasting. This offers a new perspective for the reliability analysis of tunnel structures.</p>
