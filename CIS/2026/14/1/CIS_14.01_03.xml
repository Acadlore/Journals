      <abstract><p>Industrial symbiosis (IS) represents a strategic framework for collaboration among companies through innovative partnerships, which aimed at optimizing resource utilization, reducing environmental impact, and promoting sustainable development in line with the principles of circular economy. This study conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of IS tools in resource management. Publications from January 2020 to December 2024 were retrieved from the established databases such as SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and DOAJ, with a focus on industrial engineering, environmental management, circular economy, sustainable development, resource conservation, and recycling. Advanced methodologies including the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) were applied to evaluate four key dimensions, i.e., Decision-Making (DMD), Geographical Location (GLD), Strategic Planning (SD), and Lean Manufacturing (LMD), along with 21 subcriteria. The results indicated that DMD and GLD functioned as causal dimensions influencing SD and LMD, while alternatives such as Intelligent Waste Recycling Systems (IWRS) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were considered to be highly efficient in resource utilization. The identification of dominant relationships via the threshold value of α = 0.58 highlighted strategic leverage points for implementing sustainable manufacturing practices. These findings emphasize that effective DMD, combined with strategic planning based on geographical considerations and application of technological tools, is critical for optimizing resources, enhancing environmental protection, and fostering economic and social development, thus providing clear guidance for the implementation of IS strategies in industrial settings.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Climate change and rapid population growth have intensified the need to transition from traditional linear production models to circular economy (CE) frameworks, which emphasize sustainability and efficient resource use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Mura et al., 2020</xref>). With the global population expected to surpass 10 billion by 2050, pressures on food, energy, and water systems are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Samberger, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Dodson et al., 2020</xref>), while climate change poses systemic risks that demand fundamental shifts in production and consumption patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Durán-Romero et al., 2020</xref>). The CE paradigm offers promising strategies to address these challenges, particularly in developing urban contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Bellezoni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Filho et al., 2022</xref>), by promoting organized and waste-reducing systems that align with sustainable development goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Singh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Knäble et al., 2022</xref>). CE is conceived as a model that enables economic development, while preserving environmental integrity through responsible and cyclical use of resources, supported by partnerships and governance structures that facilitate long-term resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Corona et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Moraga et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Companies traditionally operating under the linear “take-make-consume-dispose” model have increasingly recognized the relevance of sustainability principles in their strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Superti et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, CE has gained prominence as a key approach to achieving sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Prieto-Sandoval et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Neves &amp;amp; Marques, 2022</xref>). Forming the basis for resource efficiency and environmental preservation, CE is commonly associated with the principles of reducing, reusing, and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Kirchherr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Bongers &amp;amp; Casas, 2022</xref>). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, established in 2010, is one of the most influential initiatives in promoting this transition and it has played a critical role in accelerating the global adoption of CE practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Korhonen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The transition from linear economic models to sustainable production systems has placed CE at the forefront of global environmental strategies. Within this framework, regulatory approaches and operational tools such as sustainable resource extraction, eco-design, functional economy, responsible consumption, efficiency of life cycle, and industrial symbiosis (IS) are increasingly recognized as key enablers of resource sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Hallioui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Hotte et al., 2022</xref>). In particular, technological advancement acts as a fundamental driver of material savings and supports more informed and strategic decision-making processes which aimed at mitigating environmental degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Heshmati &amp;amp; Rashidghalam, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recent literature has highlighted the strategic relevance of circular product design in fostering material recovery and reuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Diaz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Mortensen &amp;amp; Kørnøv, 2019</xref>). IS, through the establishment of inter-firm synergies, facilitates the exchange and reintegration of by-products, thus contributing to more efficient resource utilization and extending product life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Smol et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Carolin C et al., 2023</xref>). These collaborative practices serve not only to reduce waste generation but also to prevent further depletion of natural resources, thereby supporting biodiversity and environmental resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Mura et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>IS represents a core component of the CE paradigm, defined by the physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and by-products between industrial actors located within a defined geographic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Fraccascia &amp;amp; Giannoccaro, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Azevedo et al., 2021</xref>). These interactions enable firms to lower production costs, improve resource efficiency, and capture mutual economic and environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Shahid et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Aamer &amp;amp; Al-Awlaqi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Galvan-Cara et al., 2022</xref>). However, the implementation of IS requires robust coordination mechanisms across technical, economic, informational, and regulatory domains to ensure stable and effective partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Saraceni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Mallawaarachchi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite its great potential, IS faces significant challenges due to the uneven distribution of benefits, which incur higher costs or lower gains of some companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Wadström et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, IS remains a prominent strategy for promoting circularity and enhancing industrial productivity. It facilitates the conservation of finite resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Alakaş et al., 2020</xref>), fosters value retention across the production chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Holgado et al., 2018</xref>), and supports the transition from linear to circular business models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Demartini et al., 2022</xref>). In particular, IS has shown successful applications in urban contexts, where collaborative exchanges and shared infrastructure can generate significant energy savings and environmental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Godina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Low et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, the effective implementation of IS remains complex and depends on the ability to accurately identify and prioritize opportunities of reusing resources. Despite advancement in research, there is still a lack of robust methodologies that can adequately address the interdependencies and inherent uncertainties in industrial systems. The absence of appropriate decision-making tools to prioritize these opportunities limits companies’ ability to fully leverage the advantages of IS. In this regard, the combined use of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approaches emerges as a promising solution to effectively model and evaluate the causal and hierarchical relationships among the various factors influencing the implementation of IS.</p><p>The objective of this study is to apply the FAHP and the DEMATEL approaches to prioritize IS and resource reuse opportunities, based on a detailed analysis of industrial case studies. Through this methodology, the study aims to identify the barriers and key opportunities for the successful implementation of IS across various industrial sectors. This approach will enable companies to make more informed and strategic decisions, optimizing resource use, minimizing environmental impacts, and enhancing their competitiveness, thereby contributing to the transition towards a more sustainable and efficient CE.</p>

            <title>2.1. Systematic literature review (slr)</title>
          
          <p>SLR is a rigorous and structured methodology that enables the collection, evaluation, and synthesis of available evidence on a specific topic, aiming to provide a comprehensive and coherent understanding of the current state of knowledge within a particular field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Mengist et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike traditional reviews, which may be biased or selective, SLR is characterized by a methodological framework that ensures greater objectivity and transparency in the selection and analysis of studies, thereby increasing the validity and reliability of the conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">MacLure et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This methodology is essential for identifying patterns, trends, and gaps in the literature, making it a key tool for advancing knowledge in complex and multidisciplinary areas. In the context of IS and resource reuse, SLR enables the integration of diverse approaches—such as circular economy models, industrial waste management, and sustainable development—to better understand systemic interactions and identify opportunities for improvement in the implementation of such strategies.</p><p>For this study, an extensive literature search was conducted for publications dated between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024, using well-established academic databases: SPRINGER LINK, SCIENCEDIRECT, EBSCO, and DOAJ. The search was refined through thematic filters related to industrial engineering, natural resources, circular economy, sustainable development, and conservation, and limited to studies published in the last five years in the English language.</p><p>Moreover, in SPRINGER LINK and SCIENCEDIRECT, advanced search strategies were implemented using key terms such as:</p><p>“Industrial Symbiosis” AND “Sustainable Development”“Industrial Symbiosis” AND “Resource Use”“Industrial Symbiosis Framework” AND “Natural Resource Use” AND “Industrial Re-waste”</p><p>These search strategies yielded a robust body of relevant literature addressing the relationships between IS, efficient resource use, and sustainable practices. To ensure the methodological rigor and scientific relevance of this review, inclusion criteria were defined to select only studies that explicitly addressed IS, circular economy, or sustainable resource management. The selected studies in English language were peer-reviewed and published between 2020 and 2024, thereby ensuring alignment with the study’s conceptual framework, scientific validity, and consistency in result interpretation. This approach focused the analysis on current and high-quality evidence, in order to avoid biases from outdated or less rigorous sources. Complementarily, to ensure analytical coherence, reproducibility, and methodological integrity, exclusion criteria were established and studies were removed if they were not relevant to the focus of the research, non-peer-reviewed, published prior to 2020, or written in other languages. The systematic application of these criteria enabled the construction of a reliable and up-to-date literature corpus to provide a solid foundation to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in the implementation of IS and resource reuse strategies. The synthesized evidence reflects scientific rigor, contemporaneity, and relevance for both practice and future research.</p>

            <title>2.2. Application of decision-making methods: fahp and dematel</title>
          
          <p>Based on the findings obtained from SLR, this study adopted a hybrid analytical approach that integrated the FAHP and DEMATEL methods. This methodological combination is particularly suitable for contexts involving multiple qualitative criteria and complex causal relationships.</p><p>The FAHP method is employed to assign relative weights to various sustainability criteria under conditions of uncertainty, effectively capturing the ambiguity inherent in human judgments through fuzzy logic. This technique enhances the accuracy and robustness of factor prioritization compared to traditional deterministic approaches. Meanwhile, the DEMATEL method identifies and models cause–effect relationships among critical factors, thus revealing the structural interdependencies within the system and allowing the determination of which elements could act as drivers or consequences in the framework of IS. The integration of FAHP and DEMATEL provides a comprehensive and strategic assessment of the elements involved in the adoption of sustainable practices, in order to support policy design, industrial decision-making, and transition toward circular and sustainable models.</p>

                <title>2.2.1 Data collection process</title>
              
              <p>The data collection process was designed to ensure the reliability, consistency, and relevance of expert judgments, following a multi-stage approach:</p><p>Expert Selection: Nine experts with recognized experience in IS, resource optimization, and manufacturing sustainability were selected. The participants included (1) senior engineers; (2) academic researchers; and (3) industrial managers from diverse sectors to ensure a balanced representation of technical, managerial, and strategic perspectives. Each expert had a minimum of ten years of experience in sustainability projects and prior participation in industrial optimization initiatives.</p><p>Questionnaire Design: Two instruments, one for the FAHP and another for the DEMATEL, were developed. The FAHP questionnaire focused on pairwise comparisons of 21 sub-criteria grouped into four dimensions: decision-making, strategic, geographical location, and lean manufacturing. Experts evaluated the relative importance of each criterion using a linguistic scale, which was subsequently converted into triangular fuzzy numbers to capture uncertainty. The DEMATEL questionnaire assessed causal relationships among dimensions and sub-criteria, asking experts to rate the influence of each element on the others using a five-point scale (0 = no influence; 4 = very high influence).</p><p>Data Collection Procedure: Data were obtained from structured online surveys and follow-up interviews to clarify ambiguous responses and ensure consistency. Detailed instructions and illustrative examples were provided to minimize interpretation errors. After the initial collection, responses were checked for completeness and consistency using the FAHP consistency index and cross-validation in the DEMATEL.</p><p>Data Processing: The fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices were aggregated using the geometric mean to generate a consensus judgment. For the DEMATEL, the direct influence matrices from each expert were normalized and averaged, in order to construct a combined matrix that was used to calculate the total influence and cause–effect relationships among dimensions.</p><p>This rigorous process ensures that the FAHP and DEMATEL analyses are grounded in expert knowledge, adequately capturing uncertainty and providing robust inputs for multi-criteria decision-making and subsequent causal analysis.</p>

Shared economics is a vision of IS and new businesses for the supply of trades, reuse and repair of recycled or waste products. The limitation of individual consumption is to envisage individual changes in consumption style, together with the services and purchase of products for repair and reuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Ortega-Alvarado et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> presents a strategic management perspective on design activities, to propose a process model focused on facilitating the adoption of virtual reality (VR) strategies during product development. The implementation of the VR strategy is organized into distinct categories, based on the theory of essential factors for successful strategies. These categories include the strategic context, the strategic process, and the strategic outcomes. Management factors play a crucial role in enabling circular product design at various stages of product planning and development, in order to ensure that VR strategies are effectively integrated throughout the design process. This model highlights how strategic management principles can guide the incorporation of VR technologies into product development, thus promoting sustainability and circularity in design activities.</p>

The strategies outlined include establishing industry standards, designing products tailored to customer needs to prevent overproduction, implementing energy-efficient manufacturing processes, and promoting voluntary community involvement in consumption and repair activities.

This value was obtained by calculating the average of all elements in the total relationship matrix, thus providing an objective reference point for identifying the strongest connections. In this analysis, only relationships with values equal to or greater than 0.58 were considered significant, as they represent strong and direct influences between dimensions. Conversely, relationships with lower values were excluded due to their limited impact on the system. This procedure allowed the refinement of the interaction network and facilitated the interpretation of results by clearly highlighting the dimensions with dominant influence and those with higher dependence. The use of the threshold value contributed to a more coherent and comprehensible representation of the DEMATEL model, hence reinforcing the causal relationships among the studied dimensions.</p>

      <p>In the acquired databases, the importance of tools for the use of resources in the implementation of sustainability improvement was determined. This research was comprised of the dimensions of decision making, geographic location, strategies, and lean manufacturing with their respective criteria, in order to solve problems. </p><p>Likewise, virtual reality technology has been determined as an important information technique in product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Diaz et al., 2022</xref>), with respect to the competitive analysis of the company in the redesign of products with the purpose of promoting sustainability in the development of new manufacturing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Ortega-Alvarado et al., 2021</xref>)</p><p>The life cycle assessment is a methodology that determines the environmental impacts and aspects of a company’s product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Muyulema-Allaica &amp;amp;amp; Ruiz-Puente, 2022</xref>). The assessment is part of the determination throughout the life of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Reyes-Soriano et al., 2022</xref>); that is, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal of the products. The purpose of this tool is the quantitative evaluation of materials, energy, and environmental impacts. </p><p>The other tools are adapted to the needs of the companies according to the prospects of solving the problems.

The application of the threshold value <italic>α</italic> = 0.58 could help identify the most significant relationships among the analyzed dimensions, by filtering out those with lower impact and highlighting the most influential ones. This value, calculated from the average of direct and indirect relationships, allowed a more accurate interpretation of dependencies and a better prioritization of strategic actions.

Further progress should also be made toward integrating more advanced multi-criteria methods or predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools to enhance the anticipation and change management in complex production environments. Finally, it would be beneficial to include new dimensions related to digitalization, circular economy, and organizational resilience, thereby broadening the scope of the model and reinforcing its role as a practical instrument for continuous improvement and sustainability in industrial management.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>IS constitutes a strategic framework for collaboration among companies through innovative partnerships aimed at optimizing resource use, minimizing environmental impact, and promoting sustainable development, in alignment with circular economy principles. Based on the SLR of publications from January 2020 to December 2024 in established databases like SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and DOAJ as well as quantitative analysis of IS tools, this study observed that effective implementation of IS relied on the integration of critical dimensions, such as DMD, GLD, SD, and LMD, along with 21 specific subcriteria. The application of advanced methodologies, including the FAHP and the DEMATEL, revealed that DMD and GLD acted as causal dimensions and exerted significant influence on SD and LMD. Meanwhile, alternatives such as IWRS and LCA offered high efficiency in resource management and utilization. The use of a threshold value (<italic>α</italic> = 0.58) facilitated the identification of dominant relationships among dimensions, to highlight critical strategic leverage points for implementing sustainable manufacturing practices. These findings emphasize that targeted decision-making, combined with strategic planning based on geographic positioning and the adoption of appropriate technological tools, is essential for optimizing resource efficiency, enhancing environmental sustainability, and fostering economic and social development. Consequently, this study not only provides a robust conceptual framework for adopting IS strategies but also offers practical guidance for integrating circular economy principles into industrial processes, thus contributing to the design of innovative policies and practices that promote comprehensive sustainability in global industrial contexts.</p>
