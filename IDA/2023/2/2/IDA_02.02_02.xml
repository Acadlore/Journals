      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The limited and inefficient data storage and exchange in the Computer System and Network (CSN) Laboratory at Ibn Khaldun University of Bogor has necessitated a more cost-effective and efficient solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>In light of these issues, a solution was formulated to develop an additional storage service. One of the most viable alternatives was selecting hardware capable of supporting data storage services. Network Attached Storage (NAS) addresses the issues of expensive storage devices and ineffective USB usage for data exchange. NAS does not require substantial hardware resources to exchange files. NAS refers to a server with an operating system specifically designed to meet data file needs. NAS is accessible over a local area network via the TCP/IP protocol. NAS can be conceptualized as a computer system primarily built to perform file storage server functions. Compared to file storage servers, NAS offers faster and more efficient data access, simpler and easier management, and configuration.</p><p>NAS allows access through selectable protocols such as Network File System (NFS) or Common Internet File System (CIFS). The NAS in this study utilized the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, selected as the access protocol, which operates on the Windows Operating System [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Developing a server specifically designed to handle data file needs and utilizing Network Attached Storage (NAS) could resolve file distribution problems. The advantages of NAS as a network storage, media processing, and data exchange server are well suited to replacing USB usage so that it becomes effective. The resources available in the CSN laboratory would be helpful in developing NAS for storing and accessing files [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Open Media Vault is a program used to create NAS servers based on Debian Linux. OMV is a NAS system that offers Secure Shell (SSH), FTP, CIFS/SMB, Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP) audio server, Remote Sync (RSync), BitTorrent client, and other services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ was used as a cost-effective alternative device for NAS implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ enables NAS operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Using existing components and network resources backed by the Informatics Engineering Study Program CSN Laboratory environment at Ibn Khaldun University Bogor.</p><p>Switches, routers, and access points were required as internet media devices on the local network utilizing Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) for CSN laboratory users to easily access data using technological means such as smartphones or laptops on the same network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. The Raspberry Pi mainboard was used as the NAS data storage media implementation target.</p><p>A study was conducted on using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ as an NAS data storage medium target. The study included upload and download tests from client to server and server to client, as well as NAS performance tests. NAS using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ could be developed, which this study aimed to do: determining if the Raspberry Pi 3B+ could operate NAS services; parameters testing NAS access rights from client to server and server to client; accessing various platforms; ascertaining upload and download file transfer rates from client to server and server to client; and testing NAS performance on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ using an HDD as a data storage medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Successfully creating an NAS service using a Raspberry Pi in the CSN laboratory offers an alternative for choosing NAS devices and software in operating NAS services, given the difficulty in studying file servers and expensive license availability, increasing data exchange process efficiency replacing the inefficient role of USB and purchasing expensive PC computers, providing ease of NAS management operation in a small space. The outcomes of this study could have significant implications for data exchange and storage effectiveness and efficiency in educational settings.</p>

      <p>A. Identification</p><p>At this initial stage, any requirements to design the system were identified. The identification steps were divided into two parts: identifying software requirements and hardware requirements.</p><p>B. Design</p><p>The system design and network topology used in this stage were based on those used in the CSN laboratory in the Rise-Center building of the Informatics Engineering study program, Faculty of Engineering, Ibn Khaldun University, Bogor, with the addition of the Raspberry Pi as a Network Attached Storage (NAS) feature.</p><p>C. Implementation</p><p>Implementing each step from planning to execution was necessary during this phase. Specifically, the Open Media Vault (OMV) program was installed and configured on the Raspberry Pi, along with the NAS.</p><p>D. Testing</p><p>Testing implemented in the previous stage was conducted at this stage:</p><p>(1) Testing WinSCP NAS access.</p><p>The WinSCP program for Windows 8 was used to test NAS and determine each client's access permissions to the NAS according to the configuration in the OMV software.</p><p>(2) Access testing using Windows, Ubuntu Linux, and a smartphone.</p><p>Multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Android cellphones, were used for testing.</p><p>(3) Measuring client to server file transfer rate.</p><p>The DiskBoss program tested the speed of file transfers from client to server using one client and five different file sizes. The speed (s) formula, data (A) divided by transfer time (T), was manually calculated to determine whether the received speed value was accurate.</p><p>(4) Measuring server to client file transfer rate.</p><p>To assess file download speed from the server to the client, the DiskBoss software test used one client and five different file sizes. The speed (s) formula, data (A) divided by transfer time (T), was manually calculated to determine whether the received speed value was accurate.</p><p>(5) Network Attached Storage (NAS) performance testing.</p><p>NAS performance testing on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ determined the speed stability of the NAS using the Raspberry Pi 3B+ by running the NAS on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ for 7 days. To determine the speed stability of the NAS, a file transfer scenario from client to server using the same file was performed each day by one client using one folder. The speed (s) formula, data (A) divided by transfer time (T), was manually calculated to determine whether the received speed value was accurate.</p>

If the OMV application was configured correctly, the client could effectively upload and download files to the server. If not, the OMV application needed to be reconfigured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> shows the design of the system stages.</p>

Switch 01 (Penelitian NCC) of the Cisco SF90-24 was linked to the router and Raspberry Pi NAS server. The client could access the NAS running on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ in the CSN lab room using Category 5e UTP cable connected to the D-link DIR-612 access point. The internal IP was accessed for SMB/CIFS services and the public IP from the router for the OMV GUI manager.

The NAS application layer is software that makes NAS easy for users to access. NAS allows users to avoid directly connecting storage devices like USB media to computers. NAS connects via TCP/IP network protocols, allowing users to access the same storage from multiple devices and minimizing redundancy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_17">Figure 17</xref> shows the Network Attached Storage layers.</p>

          <p>This test described the state of the Network Attached Storage (NAS) device using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The NAS server was on the CSN Laboratory shelf, displaying the DHCP IP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Information from the RB 951UI-2nd router O LED was helpful for users accessing NAS storage in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. CPU utilization was expressed as a percentage so the Raspberry Pi temperature could be regulated to avoid overheating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. The CSN Laboratory implemented all network devices by booting the Raspberry Pi micro SD operating system data traffic and booting the entire micro SD disk embedded in the Raspberry Pi SD card port. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_18">Figure 18</xref> shows the overall tool test results.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study led to several conclusions:</p><p>Successfully creating a Network Attached Storage service using a Raspberry Pi in the CSN laboratory offered an alternative NAS device and software selection for operating NAS services, considering the difficulty of studying file servers and the availability of expensive licenses. It increased the data exchange process efficiency, replacing the inefficient role of USB and purchasing expensive PC computers. The aim was faster and more effective data access for CSN lab students, eliminating reliance on USB media while enabling ease of operation in controlling NAS on small and large scales. The results could significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of data storage and exchange in a learning environment. The available NAS services allowed CSN laboratory students to improve the data exchange process efficiency and reduce dependence on USB media.</p><p>Given the availability of expensive licenses, using NAS with OMV software could be selected as one of the free (open source) software choices for building a NAS server. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ could be an alternative device selection to reduce costs in building a NAS server.</p><p>Based on the test results, accessing NAS files on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ corresponded to the access permissions carried out according to the OMV software user management settings. Different cross-platform systems, including Windows, Linux, and Android, accessed the NAS.</p><p>The average NAS performance speed stability on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ was 2.37 Mbps, with an average download speed from server to client of 2.01 Mbps and an average file upload transfer speed from client to server of 1.66 Mbps under various file size test scenarios. The speed results could change depending on the file size tested, the choice of Ethernet port connected to the switch, and MicroTik router. The average test results achieved were obviously faster than the results analyzed if using hardware with higher speeds, such as 1 Gbps routers and switches.</p>
