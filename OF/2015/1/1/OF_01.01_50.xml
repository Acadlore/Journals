      <abstract><p>Current regulations for organic pig and poultry production systems permit feed ingredients of<span> </span>non-organic origin at an inclusion rate of up to 5 per cent. This is primarily due to concerns that there is<span> </span>an insufficient supply of organic protein on the European Union market, in terms of quality and quantity,<span> </span>to meet the nutritional requirements of pigs and poultry raised on organic farms. However, 100 per cent<span> </span>organic<span> </span>diets<span> </span>for<span> </span>monogastric<span> </span>livestock<span> </span>will<span> </span>become<span> </span>compulsory<span> </span>in<span> </span>the<span> </span>EU<span> </span>from<span> </span>1<span> </span>January<span> </span>2018,<span> </span>and<span> </span>there<span> </span>is therefore a need to develop sustainable feeding strategies based on organic feeds. This feed trial con-<span> </span>ducted in the UK explores the feasibility of using a silage-based feeding system for Gloucester Old Spot<span> </span>pigs, and compares the inclusion of soya, beans and peas as protein sources in terms of pig growth per-<span> </span>formance.<span> </span>No<span> </span>significant<span> </span>difference<span> </span>in<span> </span>the<span> </span>pen<span> </span>mean<span> </span>daily<span> </span>live<span> </span>weight<span> </span>gain<span> </span>was<span> </span>observed<span> </span>during<span> </span>the<span> </span>grower<span> </span>phase (pen mean age of 11–14 weeks) between the diet groups.

          <p>Forty-six and fifty-six home-reared Gloucester Old Spot weaner gilts and entire boars entered the summer and win- ter trials, respectively. Gloucester Old Spot pigs are a traditional English breed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark28"><span style="color: windowtext">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], </span></a>and are relevant to organic pig production in the UK. This breed of pig has been utilised in FAI’s home-reared, closed herd for ten years, thus offering pigs of a known high health status to this study. Pigs were sex segregated and randomly assigned to one of three groups using a blocked randomisation list <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark29"><span style="color: windowtext">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]</span> </a>(refer to Table <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark0"><span style="color: windowtext">1).</span></a> The control treatment groups, consisting of one male and one female pen in each of the summer and winter trials, received a daily ad-lib total mixed ration (TMR) comprising home-grown lucerne silage chopped to a length of 5–8 cm using a Kennan mixer wagon (Richard Kennan UK Ltd, Warwickshire, UK), home-grown rolled barley, minerals and soybean meal. The two treatment groups, each consisting of one male and one female pen in each of the summer and winter trials, received a daily ad- lib TMR composed of home-grown lucerne silage chopped to a length of 5–8 cm using a Kennan mixer wagon, home-grown rolled barley, minerals and milled field beans (<italic><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">Vi</span>cia faba</italic>; group 1) or milled peas (<italic><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">Pisum</span> sativum</italic>; group 2). The proportions by fresh weight of the lucerne silage, barley, minerals and the protein source comprising the diets were equal across all three treatment groups and remained constant throughout the trial period, as shown in Table <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark1"><span style="color: windowtext">2.</span></a> Diets were formulated as such to meet the nutritional requirements of pigs according to Whittemore et al. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark30"><span style="color: windowtext">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]</span> </a>(Table <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="#_bookmark2"><span style="color: windowtext">3)</span> </a>as closely as possible in all three diets.</p><p>The pigs were housed in groups of between seven and eleven, in indoor straw yards of dimensions 8.3m×4.3m (35.7 m2 in area), with woodchip-straw bedding in the rear third of the pens and concrete floors to facilitate floor feeding. Water was continuously available from three drinking valves in the front of the pen. Temperature was not controlled, although the pens were sheltered from rain and wind. All piglets recruited into the trial were home-reared with access to the same forage-based diet in family pens from two weeks of age. Mean pen age at recruitment into the trial ranged from eight to ten weeks.</p>

          <p>Pigs were fed each morning on an adlib basis. The weight of feed provided per pig was increased incrementally over the trial, and leftover feed was removed and weighed each day to ensure that pigs were offered an amount in excess of consumption, and to ensure the provision of fresh feed each day.</p><p>Nutritional analyses of the ration components (home- grown forage was analysed by Independent Soil Services, Norfolk, UK) were used to calculate the nutritional values of the three mixed rations per kilogram fresh weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>), allowing any feed deficiencies to be identified based on the nutrient requirements of pigs defined by Whittemore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. All three diets were balanced in their supply of crude protein and energy, fulfilling the requirement of the pigs at each stage, but lysine deficiencies were noted in all rations, which is a common constraint in organic production. All pigs were weighed individually using calibrated weighing scales (Pharmweigh, Bury St. Edmunds, UK) on a weekly basis, and the pen mean daily live weight gain was calculated. Daily live weight gains ‘d’ of individual pigs were derived on a weekly basis using the following formula, and a pen mean was calculated.</p>

Using the mean age of the pigs in each pen rounded to the nearest week, mean daily gain for ‘growers’ was calculated between 11 and 14 weeks of age, and mean daily gain for ‘finishers’ was calculated from 15 weeks of age to the end of the experimental periods (day 91, 22 weeks of age).</p><p style="text-align: justify">Pen mean daily live weight gains for each growth phase, grower and finisher, for each diet were compared by use of General Linear Modelling, assessing trial and sex as factors, and pen mean starting weight, number of piglets per pen and pen mean age as covariates. Planned contrasts were performed to compare differences between diets. All data analyses were performed using the statistical package SPSS version 19 (SPSS, Chicago).</p>

      <p>The results of the gastric health assessment in the abattoir showed that seven of the twelve pigs from the current study had no visible lesions, two pigs had evidence of parakeratosis indicative of early inflammation and three pigs had focal, shallow erosions. Six pig carcasses in the abattoir that were not included in the feeding trial and that had received a commercial organic pelleted feed were also examined for gastric lesions. Three of these carcasses had focal shallow erosions and three had diffuse or deep ulcerations. It should be noted that these cannot be treated as a direct control for the trial pigs as they had not been reared under the same management conditions, but they do provide a preliminary comparison for pigs on a commercial diet.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion</title>
      <p>During the pigs’ grower phase (11–14 weeks of age), there were no significant differences between the daily live weight gains of pigs on rations containing soya, beans and peas. However, during the finisher phase (15–22 weeks of age), the pen mean daily live weight gain of the pigs on beans was significantly lower than that of the pigs on soya. During the finisher phase, no significant difference was observed between the growth performance of the pigs on the pea ration and those on the soya ration. However, in a practical context it is speculated that the slight short-fall in growth rate observed in the pigs fed the bean ration may be offset by the lower cost of production of beans in the UK. Overall, these results suggest that providing 100 per cent organic feed for pigs combining locally grown protein sources, particularly peas, as part of a lucerne silage-based ration is feasible, although further research to explore the use of these feeds with commercial pig breeds is required. Beans and peas may represent economically viable alternatives to soya, as they can be cheaper to grow than soya is to buy in the UK. However, a comprehensive assessment of the economic implications of replacing soya with peas and beans as part of a forage based ration for pigs is required.</p><p>The gastric health assessments in the abattoir suggest that TMR forage-based diets for pigs may be beneficial for gastric health. These preliminary findings are consistent with those of Kortelainen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] who conducted digestibility trials and suggested that grass silage could pro-vide some available protein and other nutrients for growing pigs, and could prevent the development of gastric ulcerations. A trial is warranted to investigate these effects further by comparing forage-fed pigs to pigs fed a commercial grain-based ration under the same management conditions, in terms of gastric health.</p><p>Comparisons between the amounts of energy and nutrients provided by the TMRs per pig each day during this trial, and the daily nutritional requirements of the grower-finisher pigs, revealed a dietary deficiency in lysine throughout the trial in all diets. This is one of the main challenges in organic ration formulation, which may restrict the growth rate and feed conversion efficiency of pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. It is proposed that if this feeding system was utilised for conventional pigs, synthetic amino acids could be added to the TMR formulation to mitigate deficiencies.</p><p>During this trial, it was noted that as the pigs were occupied with foraging for the majority of their time, very low lev-els of aggressive and adverse behaviours were observed (Anna Wharton, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. Conversation with Laura Higham, 27 January 2015.). These observations were made for the purposes of a separate study in three ten-minute blocks weekly, for the duration of the trial, using behavioural indices adapted from Andersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] (Anna Wharton, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. Conversation with Laura Higham, 27 January 2015.). Aggression in established groups can be caused by competition for food [28] and misdirected foraging behaviour towards pen mates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. These aggressive motives may be abated in this system by providing forage-based feed over a large floor area allowing synchronous feeding behaviour for most of the day, as well as manipulable bedding materials. In conjunction with the outcomes of the gastric health assessments, the behaviours observed in this study suggest that there may be positive welfare effects of providing forage-based rations for pigs. </p><p>The use of home- grown silage-based rations incorporating locally grown protein sources may be economically more efficient than purchasing commercial organic feeds for growing and finishing pigs. Work is required to evaluate the total cost of production of pigs on forage-based rations, taking in to account the necessary labour and equipment for preparing the rations. The observations in this study have been made despite differences in the crude protein intakes of pigs in the different groups. Future work including the effects of protein source and intake on carcass grades, back fat measurements and other carcass traits would be valuable.</p><p>In this paper, we discuss a number of potential welfare, environmental and economic (‘3Es’) benefits of a novel forage-based feeding system for organic pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The use of Gloucester Old Spot pigs in a straw yard system demon-strates the feasibility of this feeding system for a traditional breed, which may be applicable to diversifying mixed or arable farms with a mixer wagon and suitable housing fa-cilities. However, it is acknowledged that further work is required to explore the feasibility of this feeding system in commercial pig production facilities. This study could in-form future research in the growth performance of pigs of commercial breeds fed forage-based rations, and to com-pare ‘3Es’ outcomes of forage-based feeds and commer-cial, conventional rations. Future research may seek to compare the effect of the protein sources on weight gain by balancing the crude protein intakes, thereby providing isonitrogenous diets to the pigs in each group. In addi-tion, work is required to further investigate the effects of forage-based rations on gastric health in pigs as part of a controlled trial.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In light of the environmental impacts of soybean production, increasing price and concerns for the future availability of soya, UK-grown grain legumes including peas and beans were hypothesized to offer sustainable alternatives as part of a TMR for pigs. A two-part trial in 2012 and 2014 was implemented in Oxford, UK, to test this hypothesis. Notwithstanding the limitations of the current feasibility study that utilises a traditional pig breed in a straw-based unit, results suggest that the inclusion of locally grown sources of protein, particularly peas, may be used to re-place soya as part of a forage-based diet feeding strategy for organic pig production from 1 January 2018. This novel feeding strategy may be particularly of interest to farmers seeking options for diversification within mixed or arable farms with suitable facilities.</p>
