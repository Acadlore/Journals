      <abstract><p>In a global context where buildings account for approximately 30% of final energy demand and 26% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, improving the building envelope is a key strategy for achieving sustainability goals. This study investigates the energy, environmental and visual performance of a dynamic Second Skin Fac¸ade (SSF) system applied as a passive retrofit solution for a typical office building located in Trondheim, Norway. The SSF integrates adaptive technologies and is composed of 3D-printed panels in Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA): solid panels for opaque walls and perforated panels for windows. A simulation-based methodology using TRNSYSsoftware was implemented to compare the performance of the retrofitted building against a reference case. Additionally, a gate-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment was performed to assess the environmental impact of the 3D-printed components. Results highlight a reduction in primary energy demand by up to 25.5% and an annual decrease of approximately 1.4 tCO<sub>2eq</sub>, particularly when the dynamic shading control is based on vertical solar radiation. Although the Global Warming Potential of ASA panels is higher than that of conventional materials, the local production and Norway’s low-carbon electricity grid contribute to a favorable environmental profile. The f indings underline the potential of 3D printing for adaptive envelope solutions.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Currently, buildings are responsible for nearly 30% of global energy consumption and account for approximately 26% of worldwide carbon emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. To address this issue, the European Union has introduced long-term goals aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. A substantial portion of the non-residential buildings across the EU were constructed before 1990, and approximately 55% of this stock remains unrenovated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. In Norway, about half of the existing commercial buildings were constructed between 1981 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. This implies that the majority of commercial structures in these regions are neither very old nor brand-new, but of medium age (often corresponding to the era of building codes from the 1980s, 90s, and 2000s). It should be noted that when considering floor area or volume, the influence of post-1980 buildings could be even greater, as newer commercial buildings (such as large shopping malls or office complexes built in the 2000s) generally have a larger floor space than early 20th-century shops or warehouses. Regionally, the breakdown by county aligns with the above: for instance, Trøndelag (Central Norway) has about 55% of its commercial buildings built 1981–2010, while Agder (Southern Norway) is around 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. In Northern Norway, which comprises the counties of Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark, approximately 45% to 50% of the current commercial building stock was constructed between 1981 and 2010. Since major cities in these regions followed suit and saw extensive development in the late 20th century, a large proportion of their commercial building stock dating from the same period. Overall, official statistics confirm that the commercial building stocks in central and southern Norway are dominated by structures built between 1981 and 2010, accounting for roughly half to a little over half of all commercial buildings in each region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Consequently, there is growing government support for retrofit strategies aimed at enhancing building energy efficiency. These retrofit interventions can be categorized into two broad categories: active and passive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Active strategies incorporate technologies that enhance energy efficiency, whereas passive strategies aim to reduce energy consumption by regulating thermal exchanges and maximizing the benefits of natural lighting, heating, or cooling. Among passive methods, the building envelope is a crucial component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. However, retrofitting the envelope by replacing glazing or improving insulation is not always feasible due to heritage constraints or cost limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. In such cases, the application of a non-invasive, lightweight, and low-maintenance external Second-Skin Façade (SSF) system can serve as a viable alternative to improve thermal performance. SSF systems offer an efficient balance between cost, performance, and installation simplicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. These systems typically consist of a secondary external layer separated from the main façade by an air gap. Due to their structural simplicity, SSF system can easily incorporate various materials, including innovative light-weight components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Nonetheless, research into SSF systems in cold climates remains limited, particularly regarding the use of 3D-printed materials in such regions. Despite this, these innovative materials are becoming increasingly popular in modern architectural applications thanks to their lightweight, adaptability, and aesthetic flexibility in both new construction and renovations, offering thermal benefits that support passive heating and cooling, which in turn helps to reduce energy usage and carbon emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>This paper aims to evaluate the impact of passive retrofit actions on a typical office building in terms of energy, environmental, and visual comfort from a Nordic climate perspective, aiming to address the gaps in this region. The analysis was carried out using the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] comparing the results of a reference office building with those achievable by adopting a passive retrofit action on the building envelope across a whole year. In particular, the refurbishment consists of installing a dynamic Second-Skin Façade system realized with two types of 3D-printed panels: (i) opaque solid panels on wall surfaces and (ii) perforated ones on openings, both realized in Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p>

      <title>2. Material and methods</title>
      <p>This section outlines the methodological framework used to evaluate the integration of the SSF system into the selected building model, including its energy and environmental impacts. The approach is structured into three main phases. First, a representative building model is defined and characterized (Section 2.1), serving as the baseline for simulation and comparative analysis. Second, the SSF system, its design, configuration, and operational principles, is described in detail (Section 2.2). Lastly, energy, environmental and visual comfort analyses are described in detail (Section 2.3).</p>

          <p>The study focuses on an office building. It aims to propose a general operational methodology and highlight a best practice for retrofit actions in the Norwegian context. The software TRNSYS 18 has been used to evaluate the potential benefit achievable in an office building refurbishment using a 3D-print material (ASA) as the outer layer in an SSF system in terms of primary energy saving and reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The reference building investigated in this research has been modeled in SketchUp 3D-modeling software based on a “typical” office building from the IEA Annex 27 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. It is a seven-story building 45.9 m wide, 14.4 m deep, and 28.9 m tall. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> reports the simulated building, highlighting the Thermal Zones (TZs) per floor. In particular, the geometrical model was realized using SketchUp 3D-modeling software, dividing each floor into five TZs upon varying the space typology, office or stairs, and the orientation, east or west.</p><p>The windows were implemented only on the two main façades, considering the optimal Windows-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] and equal to 33% and 34% for the East façade and the West façade, respectively.</p><p>The geometrical model was then imported into TRNSYS to characterize the envelope (all surfaces are modeled as massless), the internal gains, and the setpoints for the cooling and heating systems. The study was carried out considered the building located in Trondheim (63°26’24”N, 10°24’0”E), central Norway.</p><p>The most common building typology of the Norwegian building stock has been modeled as a reference building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], classified as a medium-aged building (built between 1981 and 2010). The envelope of this building typology has been characterized differently in terms of thermal transmittance (U-value), according to its age and contemporary building regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the implemented U-values. In TRNSYS, the reference building has been simulated through Type 56.</p>

            <title>2.2. Dynamic ssf system</title>
          
          <p>In the refurbishment cases, a dynamic SSF system (consisting of the SSF external layer, a 10 cm wide air cavity, and an insulation layer on the outer surface of the existing exterior wall) integrating the 3D-print material as the external layer has been implemented on the whole reference building’s walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>). Two types of ASA 3D-printed panels (the size of each panel is 60 cm × 60 cm × 1.5 cm) were considered for installation on the opaque and transparent building envelope: a solid panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, red marker) and a perforated panel with 28% porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, blue marker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>The SSF system was implemented in TRNSYS through Type 1230. This TRNSYS Type, coupled with Type 56 reproduces the behavior of the external second-skin layer with the 10 cm wide air cavity. In particular, the external layer of the building wall (modeled with Type 56), usually an insulation layer, acts as an interface layer between the two Types by coupling its temperature and thermal resistance to model the wall heat transfer. Type 1230 takes into account the following factors: (i) solar radiation, long-wave radiation, and air convection on the external surface of the outer layer; (ii) energy storage and conduction within the outer layer; (iii) radiation exchange between the outer layer and the air cavity; (iv) convective exchanges from all surfaces that face the air cavity; and (v) conduction through the interface layer. More details about Type 1230 can be found in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. In particular, in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] the authors calibrated and validated the numerical model of the SSF system used in this research based on experimental data collected in the southern Italian climate. The comparison between the experimental and the numerical data demonstrated good reliability of this numerical model, with an RMSE of 0.4℃ and 0.2℃ for the indoor air temperature and the temperature of the air cavity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. In this paper, the insulation layer (Expanded PolyStyrene—EPS, l = 0.041 W/mK) was set equal to 0.051 m in order to meet the U-value threshold of 0.22 W/m<sup><sub>2</sub></sup>K specified by current legislation on the performance of the building envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>].</p><p>The 3D printed panels were realized by using the Stratasys F900 3D printer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] with the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, considering a 20% Gyroid filling. The thermal properties of the solid panel were experimentally derived by using the Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyser (TPS 1000) as described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. In particular, the experimental results showed a thermal conductivity equal to 0.0249 W/mK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>].</p>

These assumptions could be the main limitation of this work.</p><p>According to reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>], air infiltration through the building envelope, driven by pressure differences between the interior and the façade, can be significantly affected by changes in the envelope’s geometry and material composition. In this context, the study presented here represents an initial step toward a broader experimental investigation. Currently, only experimental weather data for a northern location was available, whereas the numerical model of the SSF system incorporating 3D-printed materials was developed and validated in Southern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Further experimental analysis is required in the Nordic Region to assess the influence of different boundary conditions and the effects on the overall balance from a fluid-dynamic perspective.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> presents the operative states in the two different control strategies adopted for opening/closing the dynamic shading system of the SSF (first letter of the state, O = open and C = closed) and the shutters of the air cavity (second letter of the state, O = open and C = closed).</p>

When this index is positive, refurbishment actions allow for a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions compared to the reference case.</p><p>In addition, in this study, a gate-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] was performed to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with the manufacturing and assembly phase of a façade cladding panel produced using FDM with ASA polymer. The analysis includes the preparation time, printing time, energy consumption, and material usage (ASA and SR-30 support), as realized on a Stratasys F900 3D printer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. The assessment follows the ISO 14040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>] standards and is limited to the product stage modules A2–A3, in line with EN 15804. Upstream raw material production (A1) and downstream stages such as transport, installation, use, and end-of-life (A4–C4) are excluded from the system boundary. The Global Warming Potential for a single 3D-printed panel (GWPpanel) is calculated using the following equation:</p>

Beyond carbon metrics, 3D printing offers considerable functional benefits: the ability to produce customized geometries, embed passive climate-responsive features, and integrate multiple roles (e.g., structural, aesthetic, and environmental) within a single component. It also supports modularity, on-demand production, and design for disassembly, aligning with the circular economy principles.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref> lists the minimum and maximum CDA and UDI values associated with all the TZs on the third floor of the office building for all simulation cases.</p>

      <p>This study examines the energy, environmental, and visual comfort performance of a dynamic SSF system that incorporates 3D-printed panels as a retrofit measure for a typical office building in Norway. Two different control logics were analyzed, considering the outdoor vertical solar irradiation and the indoor horizontal illuminance values on the desks. The results showed that the proposed retrofit action was able to improve the overall performance of the building in terms of daylight uniformity on the floor (up to 77.2%), PES, and <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, respectively). Nonetheless, some limitations remain. The carbon footprint remains higher than that of standard materials, which is a significant limitation, particularly in regions with carbon-intensive electricity sources. In conclusion, while the 3D-printed ASA panel does not outperform conventional materials from a purely carbon standpoint, its value emerges in projects prioritizing customization, digital fabrication, local production, and smart envelope integration. In such cases, its broader sustainability potential may justify its adoption, especially when embedded in a low-impact, system-oriented architectural strategy.</p>
