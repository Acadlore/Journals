      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Road networks are fundamental to facilitating transportation, economic progress, and public safety. They serve as the backbone of modern societies, enabling the movement of goods, services, and people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The durability and efficiency of these networks are essential for sustaining economic growth and ensuring the well-being of communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. However, roadways face constant threats from wear and tear due to heavy traffic loads, fluctuating environmental conditions, and aging infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Over time, these factors contribute to the formation of cracks, which, if not detected and repaired promptly, can expand and lead to severe damage. Such deterioration compromises the structural integrity of roads, escalates repair costs, and disrupts transportation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. The resulting damage not only increases maintenance costs but also poses significant safety hazards, including accidents and delays. For instance, road cracks, if left unaddressed, can cause tire blowouts or accidents, and in some cases, lead to road closures, halting economic activities. Therefore, developing effective methods for detecting and addressing cracks is critical to preserving road functionality and extending their operational lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, identifying road cracks has heavily relied on manual inspection methods. Workers physically assess road surfaces by walking or driving along them to identify visible cracks and evaluate their severity. While simple, this approach is fraught with limitations. It is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error, relying heavily on the experience and judgment of inspectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Subtle or faint cracks often go unnoticed during manual inspections, especially those located in hard-to-see areas or obscured by debris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. These missed cracks can grow over time, leading to significant structural failures and costly repairs. Moreover, the subjectivity inherent in manual inspections results in inconsistencies, meaning that critical areas in need of attention may not be prioritized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. As road networks expand, manual inspections become increasingly impractical. For example, monitoring extensive highway systems in large cities or remote areas becomes inefficient, highlighting the urgent need for more scalable and reliable alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>To address the shortcomings of manual methods, recent technological advancements have led to the development of automated road crack detection systems. These systems incorporate techniques from computer vision, image processing, and artificial intelligence to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Automated methods aim to provide more consistent, accurate, and scalable solutions for crack detection. For example, machine learning (ML) models have been utilized to classify cracks based on engineered features, such as texture, shape, and intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Image processing techniques, such as contrast enhancement, improve crack visibility by filtering out irrelevant background noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. While these systems have demonstrated potential in improving detection efficiency, they face several challenges that hinder their effectiveness in real-world applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>A major limitation of many automated crack detection systems is their sensitivity to variations in road textures, lighting conditions, and crack geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Roads often exhibit diverse surface patterns and environmental conditions, such as shadows, glare, and debris, which can obscure crack features and hinder accurate detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. For instance, in urban environments, road surfaces may be affected by uneven lighting from streetlights or sun exposure, which can create false positives or missed cracks in shaded areas. Many current systems rely on static or predefined rules to detect cracks, making them less adaptable to these changes. Furthermore, noise in captured images and complex backgrounds can lead to false detections or missed cracks, further diminishing the reliability of these systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. For example, automated systems may mistakenly identify tire marks or dirt as cracks. The reliance on manual feature engineering to distinguish cracks from non-cracks is also error-prone and labor-intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the performance of these systems often degrades when applied to new datasets or road conditions that differ from their training data, limiting their generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p><p>Deep learning (DL) models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been explored for road crack detection due to their ability to learn features directly from raw data. These models have shown promise in reducing the need for manual feature engineering and improving detection accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. However, DL approaches also present challenges. They are highly dependent on large labeled datasets for training, which may not always be available or diverse enough to cover all possible road conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the computational complexity of DL models often makes them unsuitable for real-time applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. For example, in areas with limited access to high-performance hardware, real-time detection may not be feasible. Even with powerful hardware, DL models may struggle to detect faint or irregular cracks, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. This highlights the need for a more adaptable and comprehensive approach to road crack detection.</p><p>In response to these challenges, this study proposes an innovative solution: the ANFIS-based road crack detection model, aimed at overcoming the limitations of both traditional and existing automated methods. The proposed framework combines the adaptability and robustness of fuzzy logic with the learning capabilities of ANFIS to dynamically handle variations in crack patterns, intensities, and geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>). Unlike conventional methods, this model integrates advanced fuzzy membership functions and Einstein fuzzy operators, enabling precise aggregation and segmentation of crack features under diverse and challenging conditions. For instance, in environments with varied lighting or surface textures, the model’s adaptability allows it to accurately distinguish cracks from non-crack features.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The field of road crack detection has evolved significantly in recent years, with numerous methods being proposed to address the challenges of accurate, efficient, and scalable crack identification. Early approaches primarily relied on manual inspection and basic image processing techniques, such as edge detection and thresholding. These methods, while simple, are limited by their inability to handle complex road textures and environmental conditions, leading to frequent false positives and missed cracks.</p><p>Recent advancements have seen the integration of ML and DL techniques. Traditional ML methods, such as support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, have been employed to classify road cracks based on engineered features like texture, shape, and intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. These models, however, often require extensive feature engineering and may struggle to generalize to different datasets or road conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Moreover, their performance can be compromised by variations in lighting, surface conditions, and noise in the images.</p><p>DFP-Net, proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], is an advanced model for road crack segmentation based on a feature pyramid network (FPN). By utilizing multi-scale feature extraction, DFP-Net captures cracks of varying sizes and orientations, enhancing segmentation accuracy even in the presence of noise and complex crack patterns. This approach enables better crack detection across diverse road conditions, making it highly beneficial for real-world applications.</p><p>However, DFP-Net has limitations, including its reliance on large labeled datasets, which may be difficult to obtain. Additionally, the model’s computational complexity could hinder real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. It is also sensitive to environmental factors such as lighting and road surface texture, potentially affecting detection accuracy. Moreover, DL models like DFP-Net are prone to overfitting and may struggle to generalize to new road conditions, limiting their effectiveness in practical, large- scale road maintenance tasks.</p><p>In recent years, fuzzy logic has been employed in road crack detection due to its ability to handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in crack characteristics, such as “faint” or “irregular” cracks. Fuzzy logic provides a flexible framework for modeling these imprecise concepts, making it a valuable tool in situations where traditional methods fall short [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. This approach leverages fuzzy logic to handle uncertainties in crack detection, improving accuracy and adaptability to varying road conditions. The multi-stage process progressively refines detection, and the inclusion of structural analysis helps assess crack severity, aiding in maintenance prioritization. However, the framework has limitations, such as the complexity of designing and calibrating fuzzy logic membership functions. It may not capture intricate crack details as effectively as advanced techniques like DL. The multi-stage process also increases computational overhead, which can be challenging for real-time applications. Additionally, sparse or inconsistent labeled data and the need for adaptation to different road conditions may hinder its scalability.</p><p>Fuzzy systems have been integrated with image processing techniques to improve crack visibility and contrast while reducing noise and background clutter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. These methods, however, typically lack the ability to learn directly from data, limiting their application to new road conditions or unseen crack patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. One such model is the ANFIS, which integrates fuzzy logic with neural networks to provide a more robust and adaptable solution for road crack detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. ANFIS has shown promise in overcoming some of the limitations of traditional fuzzy systems by enabling learning from data while retaining the flexibility of fuzzy logic. The proposed ANFIS-based model in this study builds upon this concept by incorporating advanced fuzzy membership functions and Einstein fuzzy operators, offering a more adaptable and comprehensive solution to the challenges faced in real-world crack detection applications.</p><p>The proposed approach significantly addresses several limitations inherent in traditional and automated road crack detection methods, as demonstrated through a comparative analysis with existing technologies. Traditional methods, such as edge-detection algorithms and ML-based models, often struggle with variability in road conditions, including changes in lighting, diverse textures, and irregular crack geometries. The dynamic nature of the ANFIS framework allows the proposed model to adapt seamlessly to these variations. By leveraging fuzzy logic, the model effectively handles uncertainty and variability in input data, overcoming a major limitation of the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], which rely on rigid thresholds and exhibit inconsistent performance.</p><p>Low-contrast cracks and faint features, commonly overlooked by traditional methods such as Fuzzy Logic for Road Crack Detection (FL-RCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], are effectively detected by the proposed model due to the integration of Einstein fuzzy operators. These operators enhance sensitivity to subtle features, ensuring comprehensive detection even under challenging conditions. Moreover, the advanced preprocessing techniques employed in the proposed method, including Gaussian fuzzification and Einstein aggregation, significantly reduce the impact of noise and irrelevant variations, enabling reliable detection in noisy environments. These innovations contribute to an F1-score of 95.2%, far surpassing the 88.5% and 87.3% achieved by the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and FL-RCD, respectively.</p><p>Scalability is another critical advantage of the proposed framework. Current methods often lack the flexibility to generalize across larger road networks and require frequent parameter adjustments for different datasets. In contrast, the modular design and adaptability of the ANFIS framework ensure seamless performance across diverse conditions without extensive retraining. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, processing images in an average of 2.5 seconds, significantly faster than the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] (3.2 seconds) and FL-RCD (4.1 seconds), making it highly suitable for real-time road maintenance applications.</p><p>By addressing these limitations, the proposed model offers significant advancements in adaptability, sensitivity, robustness, and scalability. These improvements make it a reliable and efficient solution for road crack detection and segmentation, outperforming existing technologies across key performance metrics and ensuring suitability for real-world applications.</p>

              <p>This operator focuses on smaller membership values, making it ideal for capturing subtle or weak features that might otherwise be overlooked. By highlighting these low-intensity details, the Einstein product ensures that even faint cracks are represented in the aggregation process.</p><p>The integration of the Einstein sum and product operators provides several key advantages to the fuzzification layer:</p><p>• Accurate feature combination: The Einstein sum ensures effective aggregation of features with varying levels of importance or contrast. This is particularly useful for combining strong and weak crack signals without losing critical information.</p><p>• Enhanced sensitivity: The Einstein product enhances the sensitivity of the model to low-intensity crack features, which are often missed by traditional methods. This makes the framework highly effective for detecting faint or barely visible cracks.</p><p>• Noise reduction: Both operators work together to minimize the impact of noise or irrelevant variations in the input data. The result is a robust representation of crack-related features that is resilient to environmental and imaging inconsistencies.</p><p>In this study, the combination of advanced Gaussian membership functions and Einstein operators represents a cornerstone of the fuzzification process. This integration achieves:</p><p>• Dynamic adaptation: By leveraging the Einstein sum and product, the fuzzification layer dynamically adapts to variations in crack intensity, geometry, and noise. This ensures that the input features are represented with high fidelity, regardless of the complexity of the crack patterns.</p><p>• Strong foundation for aggregation and segmentation: The robust feature aggregation facilitated by Einstein operators sets the stage for accurate rule-based reasoning in subsequent layers. This ultimately enhances the overall accuracy and reliability of the ANFIS-based segmentation.</p><p>• Improved crack detection performance: The enhanced sensitivity to both strong and weak features ensures that the model captures all relevant details of the crack structures, leading to superior detection performance compared to traditional approaches.</p><p>The incorporation of Einstein operators into the fuzzification layer is a significant innovation in the proposed framework. This approach not only addresses the limitations of conventional fuzzification techniques but also elevates the ANFIS model’s ability to handle diverse and challenging crack conditions.

          <p>After the initial segmentation was performed, post-processing techniques were applied to further refine the results, ensuring robust detection of crack continuity and minimizing noise. These techniques leverage fuzzy set theory to address the inherent uncertainty in road crack detection.</p><p>To enhance the clarity and connectivity of the segmented cracks, fuzzy-weighted morphological operations were applied. These operations were designed to smooth the boundaries of detected cracks, close small gaps, and remove noise while preserving the structural integrity of the cracks. The refinement process is defined as:</p>

            <title>3.4. Key advantages of the proposed framework</title>
          
          <p>The proposed framework offers several key advantages:</p><p>• Novel fuzzy aggregation: The dynamic weighting of Einstein operators ensures that the aggregation of crack features is robust under diverse conditions, adapting to variations in crack intensity, size, and geometry.</p><p>• Adaptive segmentation: The use of advanced fuzzy logic allows the system to dynamically adapt to variations in crack features, making it capable of handling cracks with different characteristics.</p><p>• Enhanced connectivity analysis: The fuzzy adjacency matrix and Einstein refinement ensure that continuous cracks are accurately detected, even if they are faint or disconnected.</p><p>• Robust performance: The framework is resilient to noise, lighting variations, and complex road textures, making it suitable for real-world crack detection applications where conditions often vary.</p><p>These advantages make the proposed framework highly effective for crack segmentation and detection, offering significant improvements over traditional methods. The integration of Einstein sum and product operators into the fuzzification process offers several advantages over traditional fuzzy aggregation methods. The Einstein sum accurately combines features with varying importance, balancing weak and dominant features, which is crucial in crack detection. The Einstein product operator enhances sensitivity to low-intensity crack features, ensuring subtle signals are captured. Additionally, the Einstein operators reduce noise by dynamically adjusting feature contributions, resulting in more stable and robust representations compared to conventional methods that may amplify noise.</p><p>In the proposed framework, combining advanced Gaussian membership functions with Einstein operators ensures dynamic adaptation to variations in crack intensity and noise, leading to high-fidelity feature representation. This robust aggregation improves the accuracy and reliability of the ANFIS-based segmentation, capturing both strong and weak features for superior crack detection. Overall, the Einstein operators address the limitations of traditional techniques, enhancing the model’s ability to handle complex crack conditions and providing accurate, robust segmentation results.</p>

      <title>4. Experimental results</title>
      <p>The experimental results presented in this section evaluate the performance of the proposed road crack detection model. The dataset used for evaluating the proposed ANFIS-based road crack detection model consisted of 300 annotated road images, encompassing various crack types such as transverse, longitudinal, block, and alligator cracks. These images were sourced from publicly available datasets. The images were divided into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. The experimental setup utilized MATLAB R2015a on a high-performance CPU with 8 GB RAM and Windows 10 (64-bit). Preprocessing included contrast enhancement and noise suppression using a Gaussian filter. The model utilized entropy-weighted features and dynamic fuzzy membership functions to adapt to variations in crack intensities and geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

      <p>Key parameters used in the crack detection process, along with their corresponding values and placements within the code, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> to ensure accurate crack boundary detection. The performance of the proposed model was compared with the competing model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and the FL-RCD model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], which represent traditional image processing-based approaches. The ANFIS-based model outperformed both in terms of detection accuracy, recall, and precision, as shown in the experimental results.</p><p>The proposed road crack detection model effectively identifies and traces crack paths with high precision. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the model’s results. The first image presents the original cracked surface, providing the input data for the analysis. The second image represents the simulated intensity profile of the cracks, showcasing the variations in crack intensity across the analyzed region. The final image demonstrates the output of the proposed model, effectively segmenting the cracks with high precision and clarity. This visual comparison highlights the model's capability to accurately detect and isolate cracks, even in the presence of complex patterns and intensity variations.</p><p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> further demonstrates the model’s performance in segmenting road cracks. The first image shows the original cracked images, while the second image displays the intermediate processed results generated by the model. The third image highlights the refined crack segmentation results. These results demonstrate the model’s ability to enhance the contrast between cracks and the surrounding pavement effectively. The refined results confirm the proposed model’s ability to isolate and highlight crack regions with high precision, minimizing the inclusion of non-crack features. This reflects the robustness of the ANFIS-based road crack detection model in capturing fine details and maintaining the structural continuity of cracks, even in complex textures.</p><p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> presents a comparative analysis of the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and the FL-RCD model. The first column includes the original cracked images. The second column shows the results obtained using the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], which exhibits moderate crack detection but often includes background noise and fails to maintain the structural integrity of the cracks. The third column demonstrates the performance of the FL-RCD model, which improves upon noise reduction but struggles with discontinuities in crack detection. Finally, the fourth column displays the results of the proposed model, showcasing a superior ability to accurately segment cracks with minimal noise and enhanced structural consistency. These results emphasize the efficacy of the proposed approach in addressing limitations observed in existing methods, particularly in the handling of noise, intensity variations, and crack connectivity.</p>

          <p>This section provides a detailed statistical evaluation of the proposed road crack detection model compared to competing models, i.e., the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] (A) and FL-RCD (B). The analysis highlights the strengths of the proposed methodology through performance metrics, confidence intervals (CIs), and statistical tests, affirming its superiority in detecting road cracks effectively and efficiently.</p>

              <p>The evaluation of the models is based on the following standard performance metrics, defined mathematically for precision:</p><p>Accuracy measures the ratio of correctly identified cracks to the total cases.</p><p>\[\text { Accuracy }=\frac{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{TN}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{TN}+\mathrm{FN}}\]</p><p>Precision represents the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.</p><p>\[\text { Precision }=\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FP}}\]</p><p>Recall (sensitivity) evaluates the proportion of actual cracks correctly detected.</p><p>\[\text { Recall }=\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FN}}\]</p><p>F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.</p><p>\[\text { F1-Score }=2 \cdot \frac{\text { Precision } \cdot \text { Recall }}{\text { Precision }+ \text { Recall }}\]</p><p>Execution time measures the average processing time per image for each model.</p>

The integration of Einstein operators within the ANFIS framework, coupled with advanced preprocessing and post-processing techniques, establishes a new benchmark for road crack detection.The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed ANFIS-based road crack detection model in addressing challenges such as noise, intensity variations, and crack continuity. By outperforming models like the model proposed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and FL-RCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], the proposed approach demonstrates its applicability for real-world scenarios, ensuring accurate and efficient crack detection.</p><p>The broader implications of this research lie in its potential to enhance road safety and infrastructure management. Accurate crack detection enables timely maintenance, reducing costs and improving road longevity. The proposed model can be integrated into autonomous systems, drones, or surveillance networks for real-time monitoring and proactive maintenance. This contributes to sustainable infrastructure development by minimizing environmental impact and promoting smart city initiatives. This research provides a foundation for advancing intelligent road monitoring systems, including integration with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Such systems could predict road degradation, optimize repair schedules, and allocate resources efficiently, paving the way for safer and more sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>Potential biases in the experimental setup include limited dataset diversity, as publicly available images may not represent all road conditions. This was mitigated by dataset augmentation and cross-validation to improve generalizability. Preprocessing techniques, such as contrast enhancement and noise suppression, were designed to be adaptive, ensuring fair treatment across crack types. However, future work should explore more diverse datasets and real-world conditions to validate the model further.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The proposed road crack detection model, integrating the ANFIS with Einstein operators, offers a novel and robust solution for precise road crack detection and segmentation. By leveraging advanced fuzzy aggregation techniques and dynamic Einstein operators, the model effectively addresses challenges such as varying crack intensities, geometries, and environmental conditions, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to traditional methods. The integration of preprocessing techniques like contrast enhancement and noise suppression further enhances feature extraction, enabling reliable crack detection even under challenging conditions. This research makes significant contributions to the field by introducing a hybrid approach that combines ANFIS and Einstein operators for enhanced adaptability and sensitivity. These advancements have practical implications for road safety and infrastructure management, enabling timely and cost-effective maintenance. The model’s scalability and efficiency make it a promising candidate for integration into real-time monitoring systems and smart infrastructure solutions.</p><p>However, certain limitations exist. The model’s performance may be affected by low-quality images or high computational demands in large-scale applications. Its current focus on detection and segmentation, without crack type classification, limits its scope for comprehensive road assessment. Future research could address these challenges by incorporating advanced noise reduction techniques, optimizing computational efficiency for real-time applications, and expanding adaptability to diverse road types and environmental conditions. Additionally, integrating crack type classification into the framework could further enhance its utility, supporting detailed maintenance planning and advancing intelligent road monitoring systems.</p><p>In summary, this study provides a foundational step towards intelligent and scalable solutions for road infrastructure management, with the potential to revolutionize maintenance strategies and improve long-term road safety and performance.</p>
