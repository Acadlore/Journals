      <abstract><p>Traffic congestion in urban commercial districts presents a critical challenge to sustainable mobility, particularly in developing cities. This study addresses this issue by developing and calibrating a mesoscopic simulation model to optimize traffic performance parameters in the commercial district of Ayacucho, Peru. The methodology was based on extensive fieldwork to gather traffic volume, travel time, and parking data. Using this data, a PTV Vissim model was developed and rigorously calibrated, with its accuracy validated through the Geoffrey E. Havers (GEH) statistic. Various traffic management strategies, including signal timing adjustments and parking supply regulation, were simulated and evaluated. The results indicate a substantial improvement in network performance: Average intersection delay was reduced from 10.72 seconds to 7.40 seconds, and a significant decrease in queue lengths was observed. The findings confirm that calibrated mesoscopic simulation serves as a robust and effective tool for quantitatively assessing traffic interventions, thereby providing municipal authorities with reliable data for evidence-based urban planning.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Urban vehicular traffic represents one of the most critical challenges facing developing cities, with economic losses exceeding $87 billion annually at the global level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Commercial areas, as nerve centers of economic activity, generate complex traffic patterns due to the convergence of private vehicles, public transport, pedestrians, and commercial activities, creating bottlenecks that extend beyond their immediate perimeter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>In Peru, intermediate cities such as Ayacucho face exponential growth in their automotive fleet, with an annual increase of 8.2% at the national level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. The Nery García Zarate market, which functions as the main wholesale and retail distribution center for Huamanga city, exemplifies this challenge, experiencing congestion that affects approximately a 2–3 block radius during peak hours, resulting in estimated economic losses and air quality deterioration.</p><p>Traditional traffic management approaches in Latin American contexts have shown limited effectiveness due to aggressive driving behaviors, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient regulatory enforcement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Recent advances in traffic microsimulation, particularly mesoscopic modeling using PTV Vissim, offer promising alternatives for analyzing complex urban scenarios and evaluating regulatory interventions before implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Existing literature addresses market-area traffic management primarily in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], with limited research focused on Latin American intermediate cities with specific characteristics: mixed vehicle types (motorcycles, mototaxis, buses), informal street commerce, and limited parking infrastructure. Vehicular flow parameters on multilane highways require specific calibration for local conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], while queue length estimation at signalized intersections demands adaptive models that consider the characteristic vehicle-following behavior of each region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>This study addresses this gap by developing a mesoscopic traffic model calibrated for the Nery García Zarate market area. The selection of PTV Vissim over alternatives (AIMSUN, SUMO, CORSIM) was based on its superior handling of mixed traffic conditions, robust calibration capabilities using GEH statistics, and proven performance in similar Latin American contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p>

              <p>Calibration incorporated Ayacucho traffic characteristics, representing disorderly operation caused by drivers leading to vehicular chaos. These aspects are integrated within PTV Vissim to better represent conflicts within the study area. Mesoscopic parameters influencing vehicle behavior include reaction times, stopping separation, and speeds. Free-flow speed represents the speed vehicles desire when facing no delay constraints, typically exceeding average travel speed. Field measurements of vehicle speeds were conducted at various network points, ensuring vehicle paths were free of delay constraints during speed recording, with results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>. Note that linear motorcycles and mototaxis demonstrate greater maneuverability within the network. Trucks maintain higher speeds due to space availability, expecting smaller vehicles to advance by using available lanes and completing segments in shorter time. Cars and buses move at lower speeds due to passenger pickup requirements during displacement.</p>

          <p>The 31.0% delay reduction achieved through integrated traffic management confirms that parking-seeking behavior, not road capacity constraints, is the primary congestion driver in market areas. The low road utilization (18.8%) supports demand management over infrastructure expansion as the optimal intervention strategy.</p><p>The contraindication of traffic signals (54.9% performance degradation, $p$ = 0.776) provides critical insight for traffic engineering in low-volume, mixed-traffic environments. This finding suggests that conventional traffic control assumptions may not apply in developing urban contexts where natural traffic flow patterns are more efficient than rigid signal control.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study demonstrates that calibrated mesoscopic simulation effectively optimizes traffic performance in commercial districts of developing cities. The comprehensive analysis around Nery García Zarate Market provides evidence-based insights for municipal traffic management while establishing a replicable methodological framework.</p><p>The research confirms that parking-seeking behavior, rather than road capacity constraints, drives traffic congestion in market areas. Field observations revealed a critical deficit of 286 equivalent vehicles during peak hours, while road utilization averaged only 18.8%. These finding challenges conventional infrastructure expansion approaches, demonstrating that effective solutions must address behavioral patterns rather than physical capacity.</p><p>Statistical validation provides definitive guidance for resource allocation. Traffic regulatory instruments achieved significant delay reduction from 10.72 to 7.40 seconds (31.0% improvement, $p<inline-formula>

These constraints reflect trade-offs between analytical feasibility and real-world complexity typical in municipal traffic studies.</p><p>Future research priorities include temporal extension to daily cycles and seasonal variations, multi-city comparative analysis, and long-term sustainability assessment. Methodological development opportunities encompass pedestrian-vendor interaction modeling, simplified tools for resource-constrained municipalities, and integration of emerging monitoring technologies.</p><p>The findings contribute to limited literature on traffic management in developing urban commercial districts while establishing an evidence-based municipal decision framework. The statistical validation approach enables intervention prioritization based on quantitative effectiveness rather than conventional assumptions, supporting efficient allocation of scarce resources. This research demonstrates that context-specific, statistically validated traffic engineering approaches can achieve substantial performance improvements in developing urban environments, providing a foundation for sustainable mobility solutions in rapidly growing cities.</p>
