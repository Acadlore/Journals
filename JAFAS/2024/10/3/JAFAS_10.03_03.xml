      <abstract><p>In the contemporary digital era, individuals are afforded the convenience of instantaneous transactions through electronic wallets (e-wallets) when engaging in online shopping. This study aims to investigate the extent to which the adoption of e-wallets influences impulsive purchasing behavior, with a particular focus on the moderating effects of low distribution costs (LDC) and short transit times. A descriptive quantitative methodology was employed, targeting users of Indonesian e-wallets. A non-probability research design was utilized, specifically employing snowball sampling techniques. Data were collected through a Google Forms questionnaire, yielding 297 responses. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis was conducted to evaluate the data. The results revealed that perceived risk, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) significantly and positively impacted the adoption of e-wallets. However, the adoption of e-wallets did not necessarily result in impulsive purchases driven by utilitarian needs. Moreover, LDC and short transit times did not moderate the relationship between e-wallet usage and impulsive buying (IB) behavior. This suggests that most respondents did not use e-wallets for purchases motivated solely by practical considerations, even when LDC and quick transit times were available. These findings contribute to the existing literature on digital money and e-wallets, offering insights for online merchants and digital wallet providers. It is recommended that digital wallet providers enhance accessibility, improve transparency regarding customer data protection, and disseminate information about the benefits and utility of e-wallets to foster wider adoption. Online retailers are encouraged to offer diverse payment options to attract customers. This study provides valuable implications for the optimization of customer service in the context of Indonesia.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The development of the times and progress of technology have changed the behavior of the of the public in various aspects of life, thus resulting in the emergence of financial technology, or FinTech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">Zada &amp;amp; Sopiana, 2021</xref>). FinTech arose as a result of shifts in the lifestyles of individuals who are predominantly reliant on information technology, driven by the need for a fast-paced existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Bank Indonesia, 2018</xref>). Adoption of technology has led to a strict lifestyle where the individual depends on digital services as a fast tool and is comfortable doing activities every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">Yuneline &amp;amp; Rosanti, 2023</xref>), including online shopping. We Are Social's research reveals that 56.1% of regular global internet users shop online every week, with Indonesia ranking 9th among 10 countries with a proportion of 59.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Annur, 2024</xref>). This matter exists because people are still very interested in shopping online even after the pandemic is over. There are several reasons, namely: 1) consumers don't need to leave the house; 2) online businesses offer lots of promotions; 3) consumers can avoid COVID-19; 4) it's cheaper; and 5) there are lots of choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">Zakawali, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Populix (2023)</xref>, as many as 72% of Indonesian people use the internet to shop using smartphones. Smartphones provide easy access to online shopping platforms, facilitating people's impulse purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Sari &amp;amp; Laksmidewi, 2021</xref>). Consumers who make online impulse purchases have a tendency towards shopping enjoyment, atmosphere, heart, and situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Febrilia &amp;amp; Warokka, 2021</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">Zheng et al. (2019)</xref>, more than fifty percent of online transactions are impulsive.</p><p>Digital wallets have gone wrong. One form of technology in finance has received significant attention because of its role in facilitating digital payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">Sutticherchart &amp;amp; Rakthin, 2023</xref>). An e-wallet is a service for conducting non-cash payment transactions to enhance efficiency and convenience, and it may be conveniently and securely utilized on smartphones without limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Rizkiyah et al., 2021</xref>). E-wallet is the most frequently chosen payment method for online shopping, namely 84.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Muhamad, 2023</xref>). This makes e-wallets a factor in influencing people towards impulsive purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Febria &amp;amp; Oktavio, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The selection of an e-wallet as a method payment for online purchases is influenced by several factors, such as risk factors, which refer to problems with using digital transactions to purchase products and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Rahayu &amp;amp; Prasetyatama, 2021</xref>). Then, ease of use and utility also influence intentions for use and adoption of wallet electronics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Mujahidin et al. (2020)</xref>, transactional convenience may lead to impulsive purchasing habits. Furthermore, LDC also refers to the prices consumers must pay for goods and services from companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Le &amp;amp; Lei, 2018</xref>). According to research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Hameed et al. (2018)</xref>, consumers prioritize products, services, and delivery time for both impulse purchases and other types of purchases. This aligns with perspective of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Imran et al. (2019)</xref>.</p><p>Understanding this connection regarding the use of digital wallets and impulse purchases is critical for businesses and consumers for several key reasons: e-wallet adoption has been shown to significantly influence impulse buying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Businesses can benefit from this knowledge by offering mobile payment services that enhance user experience and enjoyment, thereby encouraging impulse purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the adoption of e-wallets can lead to impulse purchases, which is very important for businesses to consider when strategizing marketing and sales approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Then, understanding the influence of delivery times and shipping prices is crucial for both organizations and consumers due to the significance of dependable delivery., safe packaging, and timely delivery of products, which are crucial determinants of consumer happiness in online shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">Vasic et al., 2019</xref>). Gaining insight into the compromise between the time it takes to deliver a product, the convenience of the delivery process, the overall price of the product, and the costs associated with shipping is crucial for creating a successful e-fulfillment strategy in online retail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Gawor &amp;amp; Hoberg, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Study-related influence of e-wallet adoption towards purchase impulsiveness has been extensively researched in several countries; however, low cost distribution and low transit time as moderation are still minimal, especially in Indonesia. In order to test the perceived ease of decision to use a digital wallet and its influence on impulse purchases when people use digital money by using a low level of reduced transit time and distribution as moderation, the researcher wishes to investigate the influence of the of the adoption of e-wallets on impulse purchases with shorter transit times and reduced distribution costs as moderation. This study will also expand on prior research by adding one independent variable, namely the PEOU of e-wallets. Besides that, this research uses different samples with previously Because of this study, we used a sample user Indonesian digital wallet. Study This expectation can make a contribution to the development of literature related to the role of digital money and wallet electronic to ensure the best service for sellers and buyers, especially in Indonesia.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al. (2022)</xref>, digital wallets are payments that allow users to carry out electronic transactions using cellphones and replace physical wallets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Sari et al. (2021)</xref> in their research indicate that a variety of factors influence the frequency of e-wallet use, including security, dangers, customer attitudes, perceived benefits, attractiveness of advertising, service features, and discounts. Then, the perceived simplicity of use and utility of e-wallets also have an impact on their utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al., 2022</xref>). Then, understanding and being aware of the dangers connected to digital wallets is also very important, because this is an obstacle to implementing digital wallets as a secure method of payment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">Sofi &amp;amp; Najar, 2018</xref>). The potential risks associated with e-wallets, such as unauthorized access to personal information and data breaches, make it important to have strong security features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Harishanthan &amp;amp; Neruja, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Hassan &amp;amp; Shukur, 2021</xref>). This is because users can lose trust in electronic payment transactions if privacy and security features are inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">Undale et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, digital wallet payments do not substitute cash transactions but rather serve as a supplementary option alongside cash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Sari et al., 2021</xref>). Usability refers to the extent to which individuals perceive that utilizing e-wallets can enhance their performance, and individuals are more likely to adopt a technology if they find it beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al., 2022</xref>). Those that use e-wallets have the ability to transfer funds digitally between individuals as well as between businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). PEOU refers to an individual's perception of the simplicity of using technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al., 2022</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Toh et al. (2022)</xref>, the ease of using a digital wallet is due to the absence of complications and problems when interacting with the electronic wallet platform. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">Perez (2022)</xref> believes that this perception directly impacts users' interest in using e-wallet technology. Perception of convenience in this research uses indicators in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Effendi et al. (2020)</xref> argue that impulsive purchases are purchases made without planning, with decisions tending to be quick and ambitious to own. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Lee et al. (2023)</xref> impulse purchases result in an abrupt, intense, and persistent need to act without deliberation. Online impulse buying occurs when consumers are highly stimulated during a shopping experience, leading to unexpected purchasing decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Thuong, 2020</xref>). E-commerce platforms often encourage impulse purchases, which can sometimes be detrimental to consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">Moser et al., 2019</xref>). The rise in impulse purchases has been linked to the adoption of non-cash payment methods, including e-wallets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). The convenience and interactivity of digital wallet applications may lead to impulse online purchases, especially among younger consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Lee et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In online shopping, shipping and delivery expenses significantly influence customer behavior and their overall experience. Distribution, as defined by Article 1 Paragraph 2 of Regulation of the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia No. 22 of 2016 about General Provisions for the Distribution of Goods, is the act of distributing goods to customers, straight or indirectly. Meanwhile, low levels of dissemination costs allude to the cash spent by consumers while making purchases of products or services from business entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al., 2023</xref>). LDC is very important because customers are more satisfied if business entities provide services with LDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akram et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, low transit time is how quickly services and products reach consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al., 2023</xref>). For people who buy products or services, low transit time is very important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">Yaqub et al., 2022</xref>). This is because people are worried about product distribution times due to their desire to fulfill the need for rash shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Bellini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). Apart from that, company management must also consider transit time so that people get the product as early as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Hameed et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The impact of risk is significant in determining the desire to adopt e-wallets, particularly in the context of online transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Krisnawati et al., 2021</xref>). Perceptions of security significantly influence consumers' intentions to use e-wallet systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Andrew et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, understanding the dangers of using digital wallets is also very important because this is an obstacle to implementing digital wallets as safe payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Ahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">Sofi &amp;amp; Najar, 2018</xref>). If a technology has high risks, it can make people reluctant to use it. Numerous research studies have emphasized how critical it is to comprehend the hazards associated with adopting e-wallets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Apriani &amp;amp; Wuryandari (2022)</xref> found that there was a positive and substantial relationship between risk and the intention to utilize e-wallets. Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abdull Rahman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Janteng &amp;amp; Dino, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">Purnamawati et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al., 2023</xref>) are consistent with this. Therefore, it can be concluded that the inclination to utilize electronic wallets is influenced in a favorable manner by the presence of risk.</p><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): The risk of digital wallets is significantly and positively correlated with e-wallet adoption.</p><p>Lack of understanding regarding the uses and benefits of technology can make someone not understand existing information technology and cause people to tend not to adopt it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, usefulness is important so that people can adopt e-wallets. Based on previous research, perceived usefulness has a positive effect on interest in using electronic money service wallets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Genady, 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Chawla &amp;amp; Joshi (2019)</xref> found that perceived usefulness significantly influences consumers' attitudes and intentions to use digital wallets. This is in line with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Lee &amp;amp; Thoo (2022)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Soelasih &amp;amp; Sumani (2022)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref>. Thus, it can be said that the adoption of electronic wallets is positively impacted by usability.</p><p>Hypothesis 2 (H2): There is a significant positive relationship between usefulness and e-wallet adoption.</p><p>The convenience of utilizing an electronic wallet can lead consumers to exhibit consumptive behavior in their purchasing habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Mujahidin et al., 2020</xref>). Multiple studies have examined the influence of PEOU on the adoption of digital wallets. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Chawla &amp;amp; Joshi (2019)</xref> demonstrated that PEOU significantly affects consumer attitudes and intentions towards using digital wallets. This study aligns with previous research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Romadhotul (2020)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">Seng et al. (2023)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref>, which indicates that the level of convenience associated with e-wallet usage has a substantial impact on IB behavior. Therefore, it may be deduced that the use of electronic wallets has a positive impact on impulsive purchasing.</p><p>Hypothesis 3 (H3): There exists a statistically significant correlation between the PEOU and e-wallet adoption.</p><p>In impatient purchases, people do not have the intention to buy products and services online, but one of the triggers for impatient purchases is the use of digital wallets. Digital wallets allow consumers to purchase goods and services from home, removing the need for physical store visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Habib &amp;amp; Qayyum, 2018</xref>). Increased use of e-wallets is associated with higher levels of IB behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Aulia et al., 2023</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref> found that decisions made by e-wallet users significantly influence impulsive purchases, aligning with findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Aulia et al. (2023)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">Panasea et al. (2022)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Sanny et al. (2023)</xref>. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of electronic wallets positively impacts IB.</p><p>Hypothesis 4 (H4): There is a significant positive relationship between e-wallet adoption and impulse purchases.</p><p>According to a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">Sari et al. (2021)</xref>, the utilization of e-wallets has a favorable impact on customers' impulsive purchasing behavior in online shopping. This is attributed to the enjoyable and satisfying shopping experience for consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, consumer satisfaction in online shopping is also influenced by the characteristics of cost and delivery time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Saha et al., 2020</xref>). Ensuring dependable transportation, secure packaging, and punctual delivery can enhance customer contentment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">Vasic et al., 2019</xref>). Prior studies indicate that businesses that offer free shipping and incorporate shipping costs into their pricing strategy experience higher sales compared to retailers that impose relatively high shipping fees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Hackl et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">Rabbani et al. (2023)</xref> demonstrate the impact of free shipping on consumer choices in the context of online shopping. Affordable and convenient shipping and handling costs are crucial for improving customer experience and loyalty in e-commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Amulya, 2019</xref>). Supplying consumers with information regarding delivery timeframes and freight prices might assist them in making informed decisions when shopping online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Cheah &amp;amp; Huang, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Choi et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrate that the caliber of e-commerce delivery services has a substantial impact on customer satisfaction and can promote IB tendencies. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">Yulianto et al. (2021)</xref>, it was found that reduced distribution costs had a substantial impact on IB behavior. This is in line with research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref> regarding the acceptance of virtual currency (e-wallets) in the era following COVID-19 on impulsive purchases and states that LDC moderation and reduced transit times have a major positive effect on impulsive purchases using wallets. So, it can be concluded that the moderator effect of scarcely dispersed costs and travel time has a positive influence on electronic wallet adoption and impulsive purchases.</p><p>Hypothesis 5 (H5): LDC moderation is significantly and positively correlated with e-wallet adoption and impulse purchases.</p><p>Hypothesis 6 (H6): Low transit time moderation significantly and positively correlated with e-wallet adoption and impulse purchases.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows the proposed model as below.</p>

            <title>2.1. Data and sample collection</title>
          
          <p>This study uses descriptive quantitative methods to investigate the moderate impact of inexpensive distribution costs and short transit times on digital wallet adoption and impulse purchases. Data was collected using a Google Forms questionnaire that included a Likert scale assessment consisting of five points. The characteristics of e-wallet acceptance, risk, usefulness, impulsive purchases, inexpensive distribution costs, and short transit time were obtained from a study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref>. Additionally, the scale items assessing ease of use were adopted from the research carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Didied et al. (2022)</xref>. The respondents in this study used Bahasa Indonesia as their language of choice. Therefore, the survey form was translated from English to Bahasa Indonesia in order to gauge their level of comprehension. The study was carried out in the regions of Cirebon, Indramayu, Majalengka, and Kuningan. This study specifically targets those who use e-wallets as a payment method. However, the exact number of digital wallet users in the region remains unknown. The population size in this study is unspecified; hence, a sample of around 30-500 respondents is collected to determine the appropriate sample size for the study, and it is necessary to multiply the number of variables by the sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">Sekaran &amp;amp; Bougie, 2016</xref>). A grand total of 297 individuals were assembled for the purpose of this inquiry.</p><p>A snowball sample is utilized as a sample method to target people that are difficult to access because of their unknown characteristics in this study. This method employs social networks to identify individuals who are hard to reach using traditional sampling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Aris &amp;amp; Othman, 2022</xref>).</p>

            <title>2.2. Analysis method</title>
          
          <p>The researchers examined the hypotheses in this study using PLS equation modeling. They utilized SmartPLS 4 software, specifically version 4.0.9.6. To assess the outer model, they conducted validity and reliability tests, while the inner model was evaluated structurally. Bootstrap resampling was performed to determine the path coefficients and the moderation effects between variables.</p><p>For the outer model evaluation, the validity and reliability of the research instruments were tested. Validity was assessed through the outer loading and average variance extracted (AVE). Reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability (CR). The inner model was assessed using the R-Squared test and the significance of the structural path coefficients.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref>, data validity is established if the outer loading value exceeds 0.70. However, a loading value above 0.60 is deemed acceptable based on studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Henseler &amp;amp; Fassott (2010)</xref>. Researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">Ramayah et al. (2018)</xref> propose that the CR should be above 0.70, while the AVE should surpass 0.50. recommend a reliability coefficient of at least 0.70 for Cronbach's alpha, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">Taherdoost (2016)</xref> considers a value above 0.60 to be appropriate and reliable. Variables are eliminated during validity testing to ensure their accuracy.</p><p>Discriminant validity testing can be done using three methods: the Fornell-Larcker criterion, cross-loading analysis, and the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref> state that the Fornell-Larcker criterion requires a latent construct to explain its own measures' variance better than that of other constructs. For HTMT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref> recommend a value greater than 0.90. Cross-loading values show the correlation between indicators and constructs, and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref>, an indicator should correlate more with its latent variable than with others.</p><p>Collinearity among indicators is evaluated by looking at the variance inflation factor (VIF). A VIF value under 5 suggests no multicollinearity among the factors influencing the dependent variable Y. After assessing the significance of the path coefficient, hypothesis testing (inner model) can be conducted. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref>, a p-value less than 0.05 and a T statistic value over the crucial value of 1.960 at the 5% significance level indicate a significant effect.</p>

      <p>The inner model test results show that the variance inflating factors (VIF) have a value of less than 5. Therefore, it can be inferred that multicollinearity is not present among the variables that influence Y. In this study, PLS bootstrapping testing was conducted to examine hypothesis one. The results, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>, indicate a statistically significant link between the risk of e-wallet adoption and EWR (y = 0.272, t = 4.480, p-value = 0.000). Next, hypothesis two was examined and demonstrated a substantial correlation between the usability of e-wallets and the adoption of digital wallets (y = 0.197, t = 3.026, resulting in a p-value of 0.002). The third hypothesis was examined and demonstrated a substantial correlation between the ease of use of e-wallets and the adoption of e-wallets (y = 0.457, t = 9.855, and p-value = 0.000). The fourth hypothesis was examined, and the findings indicated that there is not a statistically significant correlation between the utilization of digital wallets and impulsive buying (y = 0.119, t = 1.926, and p-value = 0.054) due to the fact that the p-value is more than 0.05.</p>

      <p>The fifth hypothesis was tested, and the results showed that there is no significant relationship between the moderating impact of LDC on the usage of e-wallet adoption and impulsive purchases (y = -0.058, t = 1.250, and p-value = 0.212). The findings of Hypothesis 6 suggest that there is no statistically significant relationship between short transit time and the connection between e-wallet adoption and impulse purchases. The regression coefficient (y) is -0.056, with a t-value of 1.060 and a p-value of 0.289. This observed value does not meet the threshold recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Hair et al. (2022)</xref>, which requires a p-value below 0.05 to achieve statistically significant results.</p>

          <p>This study demonstrates a notable and favorable correlation between risk and the use of e-wallets. The findings of hypothesis testing indicate a p-value of 0.000, which is less than the significance level of 0.05.

          <p>This study demonstrates a noteworthy correlation between usability and the uptake of e-wallets. The findings of hypothesis testing indicate a p-value of 0.000, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 (H2) is accepted as statistically significant.

The results of hypothesis testing indicate that the p-value is 0.054, which is higher than the significance level of 0.05.

(2023)</xref>, it does not support the idea that there is a strong correlation between the use of e-wallets and impulsive buying. The results suggest that the respondents do not utilize e-wallets to fulfill their practical requirements. This suspicion arises due to the high level of financial literacy among respondents, which can be attributed to the fact that a majority of them have completed undergraduate education. Financial knowledge can curb impulsive buying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">Rahayu &amp;amp; Suja’i, 2022</xref>).</p>

          <p>When making online purchases, it is crucial to consider the costs associated with distribution. The hypothesis test results concerning lower distribution costs indicate that there is no moderating effect between e-wallet adoption and impulse purchases. The p-value obtained from the test is 0.212, which exceeds the significance level of 0.05. Based on these findings, H5 is not supported, suggesting that cheap distribution costs do not moderate the relationship between digital wallet adoption and impulse purchases. These findings contradict prior research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Wei et al. (2023)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Manss et al.

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Indonesia has implemented a digital payment system, necessitating individuals to be ready for swift technological advancements in order to adjust and stay up-to-date. Utilizing electronic wallets eliminates the need to carry physical currency for transactions, enabling transactions anytime and anywhere. Therefore, understanding the factors driving individuals to adopt digital wallets—such as risk, utility, and PEOU—is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of this topic. Investigating influences on impulsive buying behavior, specifically how distribution costs and short travel times can moderate this behavior, is essential.</p><p>This study examines the impact of reduced distribution costs and quick transit times on the relationship between e-wallet usage and impulse purchases. This has not been extensively studied in Indonesia. Research indicates that factors like ease of use, convenience, and perceived risk significantly influence trust and the decision to use e-wallets. The findings suggest that companies should prioritize digital transactions, user-friendly system interfaces, and application security to enhance customer satisfaction and streamline business operations. However, the data suggests that the introduction of e-wallets and the moderation of LDC and short transit times have minimal impact on impulsive buying behavior. Nevertheless, more than 60% of the participants possess numerous digital wallets. Indonesian e-commerce companies should capitalize on this opportunity by providing a variety of digital wallet payment choices to entice clients and broaden their market presence.</p><p>E-wallet use does not exclusively stimulate impulsive shopping behavior for practical considerations. Furthermore, the correlation between the utilization of e-wallets and impulsive purchasing is not impacted by reduced distribution expenses or rapid transit durations. This inference is derived from the substantial proportion of participants possessing a bachelor's degree, which suggests a notable degree of financial literacy. Hence, forthcoming studies could use financial literacy as a moderating variable and encompass people with diverse educational backgrounds. The utilization of snowball sampling in this study necessitates improvement in order to precisely depict the entire population, as it strongly relies on the social networks of initial participants, which may restrict the diversity and representativeness of the sample. In order to encompass e-wallet users from various regions, future studies may consider employing probability sampling techniques. To improve the influence of the literature and online business practices related to impulsive purchase behavior in Indonesia, it is necessary to address these restrictions.</p>
