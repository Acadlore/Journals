      <abstract><p>The reuse of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in road construction has become increasingly prevalent due to its potential environmental and economic benefits. The aging characteristics of RAP, particularly the degradation of its bitumen content, are critical for evaluating its suitability for future applications. The aging process is influenced by various meteorological factors, including solar radiation, temperature fluctuations, and precipitation. This study investigates the impact of these factors on the properties of bitumen in RAP, focusing on a pavement constructed between 2002 and 2005. After eight years of service, the pavement was milled and the material was stored in a stockpile for an additional eight years. The bitumen properties, specifically penetration and softening point, were measured at regular intervals over the 16-year period. Cumulative meteorological data, including temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation, were recorded and analysed in relation to the observed aging effects on the bitumen. The results demonstrated a linear correlation between the cumulative meteorological conditions and the degree of bitumen aging. Increased exposure to solar radiation and temperature fluctuations accelerated the aging process, while prolonged periods of precipitation appeared to have a moderating effect. These findings suggest that both the duration and intensity of exposure to specific environmental conditions must be considered when assessing the viability of using RAP in future pavement construction.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Bitumen and aggregate are fundamental components in road construction. While aggregate forms the load-bearing structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], bitumen acts as a binder, providing cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the rheological properties of bitumen are of critical importance. Traditional materials like basalt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] and limestone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] are frequently used in road construction, but the push for sustainability has increased the use of recycled materials such as RAP. Additionally, within the scope of sustainable transportation, the use of waste materials is also prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Bitumen is a highly viscous, black liquid essential for road construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Over time, exposure to weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and air pollutants causes bitumen to age and degrade, leading to a reduction in road performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The aging process is influenced by oxidation, the volatilization of lighter fractions, and molecular weight changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Understanding this aging process is crucial for maintaining road infrastructure and prolonging its service life. This study aims to establish a relationship between weather conditions and the aging of bitumen.</p><p>Higher temperatures accelerate the aging process, reducing the viscosity of bitumen and increasing its stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. This makes bitumen more brittle and susceptible to cracking, which can cause significant damage to road infrastructure. Similarly, humidity can exacerbate bitumen aging by allowing water to penetrate the binder, weakening its strength and cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Additionally, UV radiation from sunlight oxidizes and hardens the surface layer of bitumen, further leading to cracking and brittle behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. One of the primary concerns regarding asphalt pavements is the aging of asphalt binders, which can lead to significant performance issues such as fatigue cracking and thermal distress. Roy and Hossain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], emphasize that the aging of asphalt binders is one of the major concerns of highway agencies as it can lead to premature distresses. Song et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] investigated the aging mechanisms of low-grade hard asphalt and found that prolonged exposure to thermal oxygen aging and ultraviolet irradiation significantly diminishes the plasticity of asphalt. Moreover, the effects of meteorological conditions on the performance of asphalt mixtures are not limited to the aging process alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. The incorporation of recycled materials into asphalt mixtures, such as low melting point recycled plastics, has gained traction due to its potential environmental benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Additionally, the effects of additives on the aging behavior of asphalt mixtures have been explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p><p>A specific road section, where the pavement layers were milled, has been chosen as the focus of this study. The milled pavement layers were stored for potential reuse in new construction, referred to as RAP material throughout this paper. Information about the location of the road, as well as the basic properties of the aged and unaged bitumen, is provided in the following sections. Meteorological data, including sunshine duration, sun exposure, radiation, and precipitation, were collected from the Turkish State Meteorological Department to assess their effects on bitumen aging. The meteorological data are presented in the third section, and the relationship between these data and bitumen aging is explored in the final section.</p>

      <title>2. Source of the rap material</title>
      <p>The RAP material was obtained from a road between the Bursa province and the Karacabey district. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, the total length of the road is approximately 68 km, and the milled section lies between the 6+500 km and 25+000 km points. The bituminous base and binder layers of this road were constructed in 2002, while the wearing layer was completed in 2005. The bitumen used for all three construction layers had a penetration grade of 50/70.</p>

      <p>In 2013, after 11 years of service, the road was milled, and RAP materials from all three layers were stored for eight years in an open field mixed stockpile. Tests were conducted on the RAP material immediately after the milling process in 2013, and again in 2021 after the eight years of storage. To determine the effects of stockpiling on bitumen aging, RAP samples were collected from two different locations within the stockpile: one from the surface and one from deeper within the stockpile, 6 meters deep and 2.5 meters inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>). The gradation and bitumen content are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, with gradation curves for the bituminous base, binder, and wearing layers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

      <p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>, the bitumen content decreases over time. While the design value was approximately 5%, the long-term stored RAP contains about 3.6% bitumen. Considering the basic bitumen properties, such as penetration and softening point values in 2021, aging makes the bitumen less extractable, possibly contributing to the formation of “black rocks”. This decrease occurred over a 16-year period. Additionally, the largest portion of the aggregate was between the 9.5 mm and 4.75 mm sieve sizes. Due to the milling process, the rate of coarse aggregate decreased significantly, while the fine aggregate and dust content increased. One notable observation is the presence of 19 mm-sized aggregates, which were absent in both the design and RAP but appeared in small amounts in <inline-formula>

The basic properties of the bitumen are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. Interestingly, the bottom RAP sample aged more than the top sample, despite the expectation that the top sample would experience more aging due to direct sun exposure and higher temperatures. One possible explanation is that the bottom sample was exposed to water for longer, resulting in more frequent freeze-thaw cycles, which could have accelerated the aging process.</p>

      <title>4. Relation between meteorological data and bitumen aging</title>
      <p>Given that there are only three data points for the bitumen—neat bitumen (before milling), RAP immediately after milling (2013), and RAP after long-term storage (2021)—the meteorological data were condensed into two intervals. The yearly data were summed for the years 2005–2012 (first interval) and for the years 2013–2021 (second interval). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the relationship between bitumen penetration, softening point, and meteorological conditions over time.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study investigated the effects of meteorological conditions on bitumen aging over time. The meteorological data were divided into two primary intervals, and the penetration and softening point of bitumen were measured at various stages: before usage, after service life, and after long-term storage. The results demonstrated that sunshine duration, sun exposure, radiation, and precipitation increased by approximately 9.5%, 4.8%, 30.4%, and 11.8%, respectively, between the two intervals. The penetration and softening point values also changed linearly with these time frames, highlighting the importance of meteorological data in understanding bitumen aging.</p><p>The aging rate of bitumen changes over time, meaning that the rejuvenators required to reuse RAP material will also vary depending on the degree of aging. Future studies should focus on identifying suitable rejuvenators and other measures to counteract the aging process in RAP material for sustainable road construction.</p>
