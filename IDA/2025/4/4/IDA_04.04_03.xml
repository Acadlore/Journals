      <abstract><p>An adaptive learning framework driven by artificial intelligence (AI) was proposed in which cognitive, emotional, and cultural dimensions of learner diversity were jointly modeled to address heterogeneous educational needs in a personalized and inclusive manner. Within the proposed system, learner adaptation was achieved through the coordinated deployment of multiple machine learning paradigms: models based on Decision Trees (DTs) were employed to dynamically align instructional content with learners’ cognitive profiles, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were utilized to capture temporal patterns in emotional engagement, and Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques were applied to accommodate cultural preferences. The framework operates as a continuously adaptive system, enabling instructional content to be refined based on learner data derived from a dataset comprising 10,000 students. Experimental evaluation demonstrated that the proposed approach yielded statistically significant improvements in learning outcomes when compared with conventional instructional methods. Specifically, mean quiz and assignment scores were increased by 15.7% and 14.4%, respectively, while emotional engagement indicators exhibited an improvement of 35.8%. In addition, cultural satisfaction metrics were enhanced by 24.2%. These results suggest that the synergistic integration of cognitive, emotional, and cultural adaptation mechanisms contributes substantively to academic performance gains, heightened learner engagement, and improved educational equity. Beyond performance improvements, the proposed framework is designed with scalability and robustness, allowing for deployment across personalized educational contexts. As such, the framework offers a viable pathway for the development of next-generation personalized education systems capable of supporting diverse learners at scale while maintaining pedagogical effectiveness and inclusivity.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Recent advances in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education have paved the way for personalized and adaptive learning. Given the increasing diversity in the cognitive capacities of learners, learning styles, cultures, and emotional needs, one-size-fits-all learning pedagogies have proven inadequate to meet the varied educational needs of different students. This has been addressed with the introduction of AI-driven systems, which are knowledge-based and informed by learner profiles, thereby enhancing learning experiences and outcomes. AI systems provide significant opportunities for personalizing learning experiences based on how learners interact, perform, and react emotionally, with these factors subsequently employed to dynamically adapt instructional content to individual learner needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>Adaptive learning systems, which are typically AI-based, are built on machine learning algorithms and enable the generation of individual learning curves that learners can adapt to as their learning process evolves. These systems base their dynamic content on constant analysis of cognition and emotions that affect student output and interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. The primary intention of such systems is to enhance educational performance through personalized education, which is becoming increasingly paramount in the modern academic environment of diverse learners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Strong arguments have also been raised in recent research on the potential of AI to tailor learning materials based on what might attract students and what might be their weaknesses and strengths, thereby achieving a more individualized experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, although considerable progress has been made, there is still a tendency that a significant number of AI-based applications remain mostly reserved for cognitive variables, performance, and prior knowledge, without a sufficient consideration of emotional and motivational dimensions of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Emotional engagement is a crucial aspect of learning and education. Researchers have realized that student learning outcomes are greatly impacted by such emotional states as motivation, self-efficacy, and frustration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. In addition, emotional engagement is vital in ensuring interest and perseverance in learners, especially in a school environment that is becoming very digital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. The idea of affective computing presents an opportunity for adoption by AI-driven systems, as it is built around creating systems that can identify and react to the emotional states of learners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Notwithstanding its potential, the emotional side of AI-based learning is underexplored in most existing adaptive learning systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Emotional engagement refers to the degree of learners’ affective involvement during interaction with the learning system and is quantified using sentiment analysis and facial-expression–based emotion intensity scores. Cultural satisfaction denotes learners’ perceived relevance and appropriateness of instructional content with respect to their cultural background and learning preferences, measured through post-intervention survey responses. Learning progress represents the proportion of successfully completed learning modules and is computed as the percentage of completed tasks relative to the total assigned content.</p><p>Cultural diversity in any learning environment is another factor to consider. Learning resources and strategies that are culturally sensitive may play a significant role in complementing the learning process by providing learners from diverse backgrounds with more relevant and relatable learning content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Learners with diverse cultural backgrounds can learn how to integrate cultural differences into the personalization of learning. Consequently, AI systems that can identify and apply cultural differences to individual learning paths are significant in creating inclusivity and enhancing learning outcomes in diverse cultural contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, the moment of cultural adaptation of the AI learning systems is, at first blush, a significant part of the current literature that has never adequately explained how AI should be used to adjust any content in a culturally relevant way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>This study aims to address this gap by developing an AI-based adaptive learning system that incorporates not only cognitive and emotional considerations but also cultural differences. The proposed machine learning-based system includes data related to learners (their emotional responses and cultural background) and uses the data to generate changing and personalized learning trajectories. The aim is to enhance learning experiences and motivation for learners while meeting the diverse needs of various learners within a community. The context of this study is based on several research terrains. First, there is an increasing integration of AI into learning platforms, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), and learning management systems (LMS), which is designed to offer individualized learning experiences to learners through interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Educational technologies, such as AI, have already proven to be more efficient than non-technological approaches, as they can dynamically enhance the value of instructional materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the emotional and motivational dimensions of learning are still a concern for most AI-based systems. Furthermore, the adaptive learning systems based on the cultural dimension have not yet been developed, and not many researchers have explored the possibilities of the AI systems to respond to the culture of different learners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>These limitations are addressed through the development of an AI-driven adaptive learning platform that utilizes AI by considering cognitive, emotional, and cultural factors within a single platform. As a result, the system can offer learners a personalized learning experience that meets the various needs of students. A comprehensive review of related work is presented, followed by a detailed description of the system development methodology and an evaluation of implementation outcomes in the subsequent sections.</p><p>The study is organized below. Section 2 presents a review of related work, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and cultural adaptations, as well as methodologies and algorithms, and compares the outcomes of prior works. Section 3 outlines the process and methods for planning and developing the AI-driven adaptable learning system, including the dataset, design structure, mathematical strategies, and machine learning approaches to promote cognitive, emotional, and cultural flexibility. Section 4 reports the experiment’s findings regarding the system’s effectiveness in terms of learning outcomes, the effects of emotional engagement, motivation, and cultural satisfaction levels, and compares these findings with existing models. The results are presented using appropriate charts and graphs. Lastly, Section 5 concludes the study by presenting the findings, their limitations, and directions for future research in AI-based personalized education.</p>

      <title>2. Related work</title>
      <p>With the introduction of AI technologies, the concept of adaptive learning has undergone significant changes. Initial systems were primarily oriented towards offering an individualized learning experience through simple, rule-based objects. With the continuing advances in more advanced forms of AI and machine learning, adaptive learning systems have become more dynamic today. They can be used to respond to learners’ needs in real time. This development in the sphere could be split into several essential types: cognitive-based adaptation, emotional and motivational adaptation, and culturally responsive learning.</p>

            <title>2.1. Cognitive-based adaptation</title>
          
          <p>Adaptive learning based on cognition has garnered the attention of numerous researchers. The prototype ITS resembled traditional intelligent tutors based on rules, i.e., the cognitive tutor developed by Ingkavara et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], which personalized the learning process based on laws related to the mental state of learners. Such systems are designed to tailor content in line with the learners’ prior knowledge, their performance, and progress in learning. The more sophisticated algorithms applied to AI-based systems, including Decision Trees (DTs), neural networks, and reinforcement learning, have been introduced in recent years, allowing for further expansion of cognitive adaptation in predicting the most appropriate content and learning strategies for individual learners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>Aleven et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] introduced a framework for ITS that combines cognitive models and machine learning algorithms. This method enabled them to focus on providing learners with immediate feedback based on real-time performance data. It was concluded that adaptive learning systems have significant potential to increase student performance compared to fixed educational content when combined with cognitive models. The theoretical aspects of using reinforcement learning techniques in adaptive learning environments have recently been studied by Riedmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], with a focus on the improvement of the responsiveness of systems as a result of their continuous adaptation to the changing needs of learners.</p>

            <title>2.2. Emotional and motivational adaptation</title>
          
          <p>Meanwhile, emotional and motivational learning have begun to receive more attention, along with the development of cognitive-based adaptive learning. Harley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] highlighted the significance of emotion in the learning process, asserting that adaptive learning programs should consider learners’ emotional status to facilitate effective participation in the learning process and improve their performance. It has been established that emotional responses affect the urge, motivation, and overall academic performance in schools.</p><p>Gamage et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] proposed a framework for emotion-aware ITS that incorporates facial analysis and sentiment analysis to identify when a student is becoming frustrated and adjusts the level of task difficulty to maintain optimal emotional engagement. They also touched on what one would call affective computing, where AI would be able to identify a particular affective state based on physiological data, such as pulse rate and facial expression, to achieve better engagement and retention of information in a learning context. Moreover, Ratinhoet and Martin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] described the attribute of adding motivational schemes to adaptive systems, i.e., delivering positive reinforcement and implementing gamification methods, to augment intrinsic motivation among students. The presence of such a focus on emotional and motivational adaptation reflects the fact that the emotional state of learners has a significant impact on how they learn and should be considered during adaptive learning systems.</p>

            <title>2.3. Culturally responsive learning systems</title>
          
          <p>The incorporation of cultural sensitivity into adaptive learning systems represents a relatively recent development, associated with the growing concern about the need to make the educational process more inclusive. Song et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] assumed that it is possible to create AI systems that would recognize the cultural peculiarities of learners and adjust to them. The idea was substantiated by their publication, which advocated for the use of culturally sensitive educational materials and methods of instruction to reach a broader group of students with diverse backgrounds. One example is that culturally related differences determine how the students can refer to problem-solving or viewing barriers in the learning process, which affects the motivational process of communicating with any learning content.</p><p>In a related study, Mohammadi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] developed a model that incorporates culture as a factor in an intelligent learning system. Their study reveals that different students with diverse cultural orientations experienced varying responses to learning content. The integration of culturally suitable content improved engagement and performance of the learners considerably. Recently, research on the application of cultural adaptation to AI systems has been conducted. According to the study by Jing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], cultural differences are often overlooked in adaptive learning systems available today, which can result in content that appears irrelevant to students from diverse non-Western cultures. Their findings highlight the need for the construction of a model that can embrace and respect cultural backgrounds so that AI systems can provide more inclusive and contextual learning experiences.</p>

            <title>2.4. Integration of cognitive, emotional, and cultural factors</title>
          
          <p>Although researchers have made contributions by focusing on cognitive, emotional, and cultural adaptation in the learning system, the integrated incorporation of all three dimensions within a unified adaptive learning system has not yet been achieved. In this regard, the study by Gutchess and Rajaram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] is noteworthy, which aims to suggest a framework consisting of cognitive, affective, and cultural components, thereby making the learning process genuinely personal. The proposed model was designed to integrate cognitive assessment instruments, emotional detection technologies, and the adaptation of content to cultural needs.</p><p>Nazaretsky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] also proposed the use of a holistic approach that integrates cognitive, emotional, and social information into adaptive learning systems. They proposed that effective adaptive learning requires the simultaneous consideration of learners’ intellectual, emotional, and social factors. The results indicate that such a form of integration would be associated with not only the improvement of academic achievements but also the well-being issues within the learning settings.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>The research approach applied in this study aims at producing an adaptive learning mechanism (within an AI platform) and incorporating the concepts of cognitive, emotional, and cultural adaptability into a single platform. The system utilizes machine learning, allowing the learning material to be tailored dynamically in real time based on information on the learner, including mental performance, emotional engagement, learning context, and cultural background. The section provides a clear description of the dataset used, the design of the adaptive learning system, the mathematical models on which the system’s design is based, and the algorithms included in it.</p>

</inline-formula> Machine learning model layer: This layer is the heart of the system, where personalized learning paths are generated based on the learner’s profile. A combination of algorithms is utilized to adapt content dynamically. In terms of cognitive adaptation, a DT model is used to predict the next set of learning materials based on a student’s past performance. Emotional adaptation is achieved through the prediction of learners’ emotional states, followed by adaptive adjustment of content difficulty levels. In addition, an Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is involved in the process, which encourages engagement and reduces levels of frustration. In terms of cultural adaptation, a Collaborative Filtering (CF) model is used to recommend culturally relevant content based on the learner’s background and preferences.</p><p><inline-formula>

          <p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the integrated architecture of the proposed AI-powered adaptive learning system, highlighting the interaction between cognitive performance analysis, emotional state modeling, and cultural preference adaptation. The figure demonstrates how learner data are continuously processed to dynamically adjust learning content, thereby enabling real-time personalization across cognitive, emotional, and cultural dimensions. Secondly, the figure illustrates the various factors that contribute to the establishment and success of such systems. The architecture includes mechanisms for data collection and analysis, through which the AI system evaluates learners’ performance and informs subsequent instructional decisions. The diagram can also address the issue of how machine learning algorithms can forecast the results of students and provide them with materials that are most useful at their current level of understanding. In addition, it can demonstrate how this technology can be utilized to cater to a broad range of learning needs, including supporting students who require additional instructional assistance and providing challenging work for those who learn rapidly. The integration of AI ultimately facilitates a more adaptive, inclusive, and effective learning process.</p>

          <p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>, the proposed system surpasses the current models in all crucial aspects: learning outcomes, emotional involvement, and cultural fulfillment. Cognitive, emotional, and cultural elements were used to give a better learning solution that resulted in a high student improvement ratio.</p>

          <p>The findings confirm that the intensity of interactivity and student satisfaction, as well as the learning outcomes, are significantly high when cognition, access, and attention are focused on adaptation, learning systems, and engagement (encompassing emotions and culture). The output of the adaptive learning system, which was based on AI, was superior to that of traditional and existing models. This implies that a global personalization approach can be an extremely effective method. The factor of emotional engagement was observed to play a significant role in both maintaining the students’ motivation during the process of learning and improving learning outcomes that confirm the findings of the previous literature.</p><p>Culturally responsive materials also enabled this system to positively impact learning outcomes and create more inclusive, student-engaging, and student-centered lessons in other contexts by addressing students’ cultural backgrounds. The results suggest that AI can facilitate the development of adaptive learning environments that are truly personalized and tailored to the needs of all students.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The proposed AI-based adaptive learning system supports the diverse needs of learners in terms of cognitive, emotional, and cultural adaptations. Improvement of learning, active participation, and cultural satisfaction can be mainly realized through the adoption of machine learning models, including DTs, RNNs, and CF. The experimental results were remarkably positive, with a 15.7% increase in quiz scores, a 14.4% increase in assignment scores, and a 23.7% increase in learning in the experimental group compared to the control group. In addition, the emotional involvement increased by 35.8%, and the cultural satisfaction increased by 24.2%, which means that the system has a positive effect on establishing a more inclusive and active learning environment.</p><p>Future investigations may extend the proposed system by validating its effectiveness across different educational levels, such as primary and secondary education, and by deploying it in diverse cultural and geographical contexts. Additional enhancements may include multimodal emotion detection using voice and physiological signals, as well as more granular cultural modeling to further improve personalization and inclusivity. Although such results are hopeful, certain limitations have emerged. The facial recognition, sentiment analysis, and emotional involvement requested by the system may fail to cover the entire range of emotional states. Additionally, cultural adaptation was predetermined based on the set number of categories, which may not be comprehensive enough to identify the diversity of learners’ backgrounds. Moreover, the dataset used in this research did not include students representing all global regions, and therefore, the results cannot be generalized.</p><p>In the future, the system could be enhanced by incorporating more refined emotional detection technologies, such as voice tone identification and in-depth sentiment analysis. One of the pathways of development could be the expansion of cultural context models to consider a wider range of global standpoints and learning styles. In addition, real-time adaptive learning systems that can react more dynamically to live classroom scenarios could also be pursued, further advancing the personalization and inclusivity of learning. Altogether, this study demonstrates how AI can transform the lives of learners by delivering personalized learning experiences that truly enhance learning outcomes by considering individual students’ cognitive, emotional, and cultural factors.</p>
