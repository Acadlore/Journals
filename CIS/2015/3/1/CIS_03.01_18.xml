Societal problem-solving efforts within this realm have focused on concrete problems such as the preservation of fisheries, forests and national reserves. ‘The Politics of Sustainability’ has been discussed extensively in literature, particularly after the publication of the Brundtland Commission’s ‘Our Common Future’ report in 1987 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] emphasizing inter-generational responsibilities involving economic, environmental and social as- pects. Among other areas, the authors of the report highlighted the challenge of global climate change resulting from, amongst other things, unsustainable patterns of con- sumption. ‘The Politics of Sustainability: Philosophical Perspectives’, edited by Dieter Birnhacher and May Thorseth, brings a new angle into the discussion of the politics of sustainable development: ethical considerations.</p><p>In Part 1, contributors to the book discuss—in a somewhat pessimistic tone—the determinants of non- sustainable behavior, which are lack of motivation; institu- tions stressing and the difficulties the democratic govern- ments face when implementing the actions needed to pro- tect future generations. The authors also underscore the challenges in pressuring politicians to make real progress through sustainable policies. This is particularly difficult given the existence of more immediate short-range chal- lenges such as economic crises, high unemployment, and maintaining an upstanding national position in the interna- tional political rat-race.</p><p>In Part 2 of the book, the contributors present and discuss the strong moral and philosophical dimensions of policy implementation, setting them up, in Part 3, for the proposition of establishing a new fourth institution of government beyond the legislative, executive and judicial. This branch would be responsible to ensure “that the interest of future generations be taken into account within today’s decision-making-process”. The proposal is indeed original. Its adoption in democratic countries will face the same difficulties as pointed out in Part 1: to implement practical actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to protect future generations.</p><p>It is my view, that, governance is more complicated than is portrayes in the book and is not completely compatible with different democratic systems around the globe. To state that “the incentives for politicians in a democratic sys- tem are in maintaining power and securing re-election” (p. 55) is an over simplification. History has demonstrated that there have been many occasions in which even problem- atic politicians or legislative bodies of governments have risen to the task of confronting great societal challenges. An example is the decision in the United States Congress to support President Roosevelt in joining World War II, de- spite strong societal sentiments for isolationism at the time. The existence of great leaders is essential for democra- cies to move and history has demonstrated that they fre- quently appear at critical junctions. This is why there is optimism with societies in making continuous strides in sustainable development, including the more difficult ques- tions such as the elimination of poverty and averting catas- trophic changes in the climate.</p><p>Technology is one powerful instrument. As technical solutions improve, they become less expensive. This creates opportunities for developing countries and means they do not have to retrace the steps followed by industrialized countries; they can “leapfrog” over many of the develop- mental steps and avoid many of the problems caused by industrialization. An example is that of Brazil’s response to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the use of gasoline in automobiles.  As an alternative, ethanol produced from sugarcane (a renewable crop) was used to replace a large fraction of the gasoline, thus reducing the GHG emissions in the country by approximately 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>Ethical considerations,  of course,  are of great  importance when democracies move in more sustainable direc- tions. We must not forget, however, that the existence of technical solutions can also help governments to imple- ment sustainable solutions at an expeditious pace. This book will, undoubtedly, be of great interest to people less interested in economics and environment, and/but funda- mental to the philosophical perspectives of sustainable development.</p></abstract>
