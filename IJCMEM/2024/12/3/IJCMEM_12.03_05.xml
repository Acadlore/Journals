      <abstract><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The present study will attempt to investigate the energy dissipation in a stair-shaped stilling basin, developed as an improved model of the USBR Type III basin. For this purpose, an initial step of planning and modeling of the flume was undertaken, followed by experimental setup and data collection on the water level, critical depth, velocity, and discharge. In each of these two models, experiments were conducted for 10 variations in discharge. The energy dissipation ratio for the stair-shaped model reached 81.59%, as opposed to 78.99% for the USBR Type III. That means that the efficiency in the stair-shaped model is 2.6% higher. The velocity varied between 19.17 and 29.80 m/s for the USBR Type III model and between 17.42 and 28.14 m/s for the stair-shaped model. The maximum water level in USBR Type III was 'this', while in the stair-shaped model, it is +22.95, thus showing better energy dissipation. The stair-shaped model, also closely lies with the hydraulic jump state according to Elevatorski's formula and shows a value of 7% skewness. Further recommendations on topographic and geological conditions are warranted for the application of a stair-shaped basin.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The purpose of energy dissipators is to lessen the spillway's (chute's) kinetic energy before it enters the original river. During the dissipation interaction, the peculiarity of the hydraulics jump shows up, demonstrating the scattering system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Deciding the four sorts of energy dissipators depends on land conditions and normal riverbed materials. Free jets or energy dissipators like stilling basins can be used in riverbeds with hard rock beds because the slowed flow will be released back into the river [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The energy of the supercritical flow through the drop line into the subcritical flow that returns to the river is reduced by this structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">The spillway is a crucial element of a dam structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Spillways are dam energy dissipators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The primary function of the spillway is to manage surplus water in the reservoir, keeping it from spilling over the dam's crest. This is crucial to avoid potential damage to the dam's structural integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. This design minimizes the energy of the supercritical flow in the channel (drop line) as it transitions into a subcritical flow to reenter the river [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. When designing a spillway, it is essential to consider both the flow capacity and energy dissipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Flow capacity measures how effectively water can be transported along a spillway channel while adhering to hydraulic principles. When water exceeds the spillway's capacity, it enters the spillway channel and encounters an energy-dissipating structure known as the stilling basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The spillway comprises multiple components, including the crest spillway, transition channel, launcher channel, energy dissipator, and downstream guiding channel. Spillway systems frequently have issues concerning transition channels, launcher channels, and energy dissipators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Issues frequently arising in transition channels can manifest in open and closed channels. Cross-flow is a common issue in open channels, caused by variations in the channel bottom, such as narrowing and broadening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Irregular hydraulic performance of the transition channel leads to unstable conditions downstream. The flow turbulence in a closed channel causes two cross-flows at the outlet. A block must be added at the bottom of the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">The flow phenomena occurring in the cut-way entail the presence of high-velocity flow under supercritical conditions. Before directing the flow into the river, it is necessary to dampen it using energy dissipators to transform it into subcritical flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. An issue frequently encountered is the impairment of the downstream river caused by suboptimal performance of energy dissipators, necessitating nearly annual maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. The primary goal is to attain subcritical flow conditions downstream to prevent harm to the original riverbed. The purpose of energy damping is to compensate for energy losses resulting from variations in height inside building structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Energy dissipators are engineered to mitigate the kinetic energy at the spillway's base (chute) before entering the natural river. During the dissipation process, hydraulic jumps are observed, which signifies the dissipation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. This phenomenon is associated with the requirement of downstream water depth to reduce energy volume (water depth behind) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. The hydraulic jump can be regulated or guided by the presence of an end sill for downstream dissipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Prior scholars, specifically Bradley and Peterka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], Hager [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], and Chanson and Brattberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], have conducted extensive studies on energy absorbers. Energy absorbers can be categorized into four main types: rock energy absorbers, stilling basins, plunge pools, and free jets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">The classification of the four types of energy dissipators relies on assessing geological conditions and the composition of natural riverbed materials. River circumstances characterized by a bed composed of hard rock are conducive to using free jets or plunge pool-type energy dissipators. The attenuated flow will be discharged back into the river [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The formula for hydraulics used to plan energy dissipators is derived from the principle of energy conservation and the forces operating on the cross-section for flow conditions transitioning from supercritical to subcritical flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. The energy dissipators commonly employed as a foundation for planning are primarily of the stilling basin type. The idea of a stilling basin-type energy dissipator is based on friction or collision between water molecules, which results in water circulation within the energy reducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Various design standards have been established for the configuration of energy absorbers, such as Saint Anthony Falls (SAF Basin), The United States of Berau Reclamation (USBR), Bhavani Basin, The Institute of Hydraulics Vedeneev (VNIIG) Lanigrade (USSR), and The United States Corps of Engineers (USCE).</p><p style="text-align: justify">The dissipation efficiency is significantly influenced by the downstream water depth (tail water depth), as indicated by multiple experiments by Wahl &amp;amp; Falvey et al. in 2018. the study shows that the minimum water depth value is 0.8 times the conjugation depth (y2) for USBR type III. If the depth is below the minimum weir, the dissipation effectiveness is compromised due to jumps outside the stilling basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. To maintain the structural integrity of the river geometry, hydraulic jumps must be present in the stilling basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. Suppose the depth of the tailwater does not satisfy the necessary criteria. In that case, a negative (Stair-Shaped) slope is needed to decrease the energy loss and increase the water level downstream. Modifications to the USBR Type III stilling basins are required, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

      <p>In previous studies, this stepped form has often been used in weirs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. The advantages of a stair weir are a reduction in the potential risk of cavitation and a reduction in pool dimensions downstream of the weir toe due to significant energy dissipation along the channel. However, in this research, a stair shape is used to apply to the stilling basin. In the Stair-Shaped-type stilling basin with stair shape modification, the flow velocity is reduced due to the damping caused by the steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. The steps act like small cascades placed in series, and each step acts as a small energy absorber for the previous step. The selection of this stair shape is expected to cause collisions between the ladder wall and water gradually following the elevation of the steps so that energy can be dissipated.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The collision factor in a stair-shaped stilling basin directly influences the pace at which energy is dissipated. As the friction factor increases, the velocity of the flow decreases. Decreased air concentration occurs as a consequence of reduced flow velocity. The reduced air concentration in the flow will also lead to a drop in kinetic energy. Reduced kinetic energy leads to increased energy dissipation. Therefore, the risk of cavitation in a stair-shaped stilling basin can be mitigated by ensuring that the overflow velocity is kept at a low level.</p>

          <p>This research is an experimental investigation with primary data taken in the laboratory. The first stage is to plan and model the flume, consider the formulation used in the test, and then prepare a place for research (set up experiment). The design of the flume was informed by the findings of research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. The investigation clarified that the ideal slope ratio is 1:2, with a height of 1 meter and a width of 2 meters. Phenomena of flow in the flume are also carried out to get an overview of flow behavior in energy absorbers, especially the effectiveness of energy reduction (<inline-formula>

            <title>2.2. Test set-up and procedure</title>
          
          <p>A tangible replica of a USBR Type III stilling basin was built to carry out this inquiry. The Type III USBR stilling basin contains three circuit breakers: an end platform positioned downstream, a baffle block placed in the middle, and a trough block positioned upstream within the tank. These three components of the stilling basin are designed to reduce the flow rate from the initial supercritical flow to a subcritical rate by predicting or minimizing the flow energy. The Type III USBR stilling basin is designed based on the Froude number, and this formula is used to determine the flow characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. The Froude number equation used is as follows. The USBR Type III stilling basin design results are used as a reference to obtain the final weir height value of the Stair-Shaped type stilling basin with the modification of the staircase shape contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

          <p>Discharge calibration is performed to ascertain the precision of the discharge measurements in the Thompson measuring device. Three tests were calibrated using discharge rates of 10,048 l/s, 8,349 l/s, and 6,554 l/s. Based on the results of the three trials, the average Froude Number (Fr) is determined to be 4.56 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). This value indicates that the flow characteristics are supercritical with turbulent flow, as Fr is more than 1.

          <p>While preparing the setup experiment, the hydraulic flow formulation smoothly entered the basin downstream of the canal. It returned to the reservoir without the requirement of constructing a barrier as a wastewater-controlling device downstream of the canal. During each model's testing, measurements were taken for the critical depth (yc), flow rate along the spillway (v), flow depth (d1) before and after the hydraulic leap (d2), and the length of the hydraulic jump (Lj).</p><p style="text-align: justify">This research entails studying the initial model by examining the impact of water level at the downstream boundary condition, also known as downstream water depth. During the test, any alteration in the flow rate directly affects the location of the wastewater depth. A transparent acrylic barrier, positioned at the same height as y2, was placed downstream of the channel to generate the tailwater effect. According to several conducted research, the depth of the water downstream has a significant impact on the effectiveness of damping. The minimum water depth required is 0.8 times the conjugate depth (y2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> displays the form and measurements of the barrier block.</p>

          <p>To make it easier to control the flow and accuracy in data collection, measuring instruments are used to record discharge and velocity using Thompson, pitot pipes, flow meter measuring instruments, Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV) measuring instruments, and current meters. The placement of each measuring instrument can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. The measurement structure used in this study is a triangular spike dam, Thompson dam, or V-notch, with each side of the triangle measuring 35 cm in length, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>. The experiment utilized a variety of flow rates, ranging from 3.818 to 10.10 liters per second. The weir base is horizontally oriented to decrease the velocity of the incoming flow, while the measurement structure is positioned to obstruct the flow.</p>

          <p>This experiment can demonstrate the state of turbulence. The turbulent region, specifically the area around the baffle block, is where velocity testing occurs. It is located between the trough block and the end weir. There is an abrupt flow transition as the launch channel's steep incline transitions to a gentle incline. commonly known as an abrupt alteration in flow rate. This predicament incites turmoil amidst the prevailing circumstances. This flow exhibits sudden changes in velocity, unpredictable movements, and uneven patterns. The speed measurement value in this test is generated automatically by the Acoustic Doppler Velocity Meter (ADV). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figures 11</xref> and 12 depict a sample test document exhibiting a flow rate of 10.1 liters per second.</p>

          <p>A. Hydraulics characteristics of a spillway</p><p style="text-align: justify">The spillway building necessitates the absence of backwater when flood discharge occurs. To fulfill these criteria, the design of the spillway structure ensures that during flood discharge, the disparity in water levels between the upstream and downstream sides of the regulating weir is at least two-thirds of the water level above the spillway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">B. Flow profile</p><p style="text-align: justify">Typically, there are three ways to calculate flow profiles: the graphical integration approach, the direct integration method, and the phasing method. The phasing approach involves partitioning the channel into smaller segments and then calculating incrementally from one end to another. Multiple phasing techniques are available. However, only a select few are considered the most effective for each challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>]. The Direct Stages Method is a straightforward technique that applies to prismatic channels. The equation employed in the study conducted by Hendratta and Tangkudung in 2020:</p>

          <p>The normal depth (y) refers to the water depth in a channel calculated using the uniform flow equation. Manning's equation is utilized to compute the depth and flow velocity. It is widely recognized that calculations for flow through open channels can only be performed using empirical formulas. One such method is the Manning equation, which is relatively pragmatic and yields highly satisfactory results when applied, as seen in the following equation. The study's authors, Putro and Hadihardaja, conducted research in 2013.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Flow velocity influences the flow characteristics that occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>]. There are 3 flow characteristics based on the Reynold Number (Re) that occur: laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. The Reynolds Number can be used to determine if the flow is laminar, transient, or turbulent. The flow is laminar - when Re &lt; 2300, transient - when 2300 &lt; Re &lt; 4000, and turbulent - when Re &gt; 4000. The velocity value influences the three flows, where the velocity value is directly proportional to the Reynold Number (Re) value as in the sixth equation.</p>

          <p>C. Hydraulic jump</p><p style="text-align: justify">A hydraulic jump is the abrupt transition from a flow with high velocity to a flow with lower velocity. There is a quick rise in the water level and substantial energy dissipation during the hydraulic jump. A hydraulic leap happens when there is a rapid transition of water from supercritical flow to subcritical flow. This transition causes an abrupt rise in the water level and a substantial energy loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. The initiation of the jump is indicated by creating a turbulent vortex, which extracts energy from the primary flow and then breaks into smaller fragments further downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. An impactful turbulent vortex is generated at the onset of the jump. The vortex derives energy from the primary current and breaks down into smaller components as it moves downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. In the case of supercritical flow in a horizontal rectangular channel, the flow energy is diminished due to the frictional resistance of the channel. Consequently, the velocity decreases, and the flow height increases in the flow direction. The characteristics of the flow downstream and the amount of energy dissipated in the hydraulic leap can be determined by applying the momentum principle, which depends on the Froude number and the upstream flow depth. The normal depth (y) refers to the water depth in the channel determined using the uniform flow equation. Manning's equation is utilized to compute the depth and velocity of flow.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The momentum equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_13">Figure 13</xref>) is the key factor in determining the energy computation in hydraulic springboard events.</p>

          <p>The variable y1 represents the depth before the occurrence of the hydraulic leap, while y2 represents the depth after the hydraulic jump. Various forms of hydraulic jumps occur on a horizontal bed. The United States Bureau of Reclamation's research indicates that hydraulic thrust can be differentiated by the Froude number Fr1 of the flow in question. The hydraulic surges observed on a flat surface can be described as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>]:</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. Critical Flow</p><p style="text-align: justify">For Fr1=1, When critical flow occurs, it prevents the formation of jumps.</p><p style="text-align: justify">2. Choppy Jumps</p><p style="text-align: justify">For Fr1=1 to Fr1=1,7, the choppy jump that occurs with the ratio y2/y1 is 1 to 20.</p><p style="text-align: justify">3. Weak Jumps</p><p style="text-align: justify">For Fr1 values ranging from 1.7 to 2.5, a sequence of oscillating wave patterns occurs on the jumping surface, while the water surface downstream stays undisturbed. The total velocity is constant, and the energy dissipation is minimal. The ratio y2/y1 ranges from 2 to 3.1.</p><p style="text-align: justify">4. Oscillating Jumps</p><p style="text-align: justify">For the range of Fr1 values from 2.5 to 4.5, the oscillating rays follow the jumping platform and go toward the surface before returning without exhibiting a specific period. Every oscillation generates a substantial and erratic wave, resulting in extensive and unrestrained harm to the embankment. The ratio y2/y1 ranges from 3.1 to 5.9.</p><p style="text-align: justify">5. Steady Jump</p><p style="text-align: justify">The edges of the downstream surface exhibit curling and the location with the greatest burst velocity tends to deviate from the flow when Fr1 is between 4.5 and 9. These two events usually happen on identical vertical surfaces. The motions and surges that occur are hardly affected by the depth of the bottom water. The hydraulic jump has exceptional equilibrium, making it the most favorable attribute. The energy dissipation ranges from 45% to 70%. The ratio between y2 and y1 varies between 5.9 and 12.</p><p style="text-align: justify">6. Strong Jump</p><p style="text-align: justify">When the Froude number is more than 9, strong burst speeds cause the rolling wave to split from the pedal face, forming a downstream wave. Irregularities on the surface will have an impact on the generated waves. Jumping maneuvers are infrequent but very effective due to their potential to reduce energy consumption by up to 85%. The ratio of y2 to y1 is bigger than 12. Peterka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>] categorized hydraulic jumps into four distinct types, as identified by the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]:</p><p style="text-align: justify"><inline-formula>

          <p>Based on the results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>, it can be concluded that of the 10 experiments conducted, almost all of the flow characteristics are turbulent. The Re value produced above is more than 4000, and there is 1 experiment with a value of less than 4000. The results of this theoretical calculation are supported by observations during the experiment, where the flow has a random and rotating current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_14">Figure 14</xref>) as characterized by turbulence flow characteristics.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">Parameters for assessing the performance of a stilling basin, which are crucial benchmarks for measuring the occurring impacts, can be quantified by analyzing two primary aspects: the relative loss value (ΔE/E1) and the efficiency (E2/E1). The relative loss value (ΔE/E1) indicates the alteration in stilling basin efficiency relative to its starting value (E1). This demonstrates the impact of particular variables, such as temperature fluctuations or changes in water composition, on the stilling basin functionality. Efficiency (E2/E1) is a measure that indicates the ability of stilling ponds to effectively achieve specified objectives, such as preserving water quality or supporting aquatic life. Further explanation and calculation details for these two parameters can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_15">Figure 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref> is the correlation between pertinent and noteworthy factors.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_15">Figure 15</xref> demonstrates a direct relationship between the Froude Number (Fr<sub>1</sub>) and the energy dissipation ratio (ΔE/E1). As the value of the Froude Number increases, the energy dissipation ratio also increases, and vice versa. Almost all experiments with 10 discharges produced good data by following the trend of the polynomial graph formed. This result corresponds to the results of research conducted by the studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>]. The magnitude of the loss will vary inversely with the efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref> illustrates a direct relationship between the value of Fr<sub>1</sub> and efficiency. The efficiency value of the stilling basin performance will decrease as the relative loss value increases, resulting in a larger Fr<sub>1</sub> value. This is due to the imperfect dissipation of energy. It is expected that with the greater value of energy-damping efficiency in the stilling basin, the flow coming out of the stilling basin downstream can be changed from subcritical flow to critical flow so as not to endanger the downstream area.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">Measuring hydraulic parameters affected by tail water involves monitoring the water depth upstream of the stilling basin (Y1) located at the base of the launch channel and the water depth downstream of the stilling basin (Y2).

From the experimental results, there is some data outside the trend in experiments with large discharge and producing large Froude number values as well; this is due to several factors, including the consistency of the discharge device settings. Existing equations can be used to reduce errors in the trend. A large Froude Number (Fr1) value can indicate the characteristics of the existing flow in the form of supercritical flow with high velocity so that the energy that must be reduced must also be high so as not to endanger the downstream of the stilling basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">The magnitude of the loss will vary inversely with efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref> demonstrates a direct relationship between the value of Fr<sub>1</sub> and efficiency.

          <p>Applying the Stair-Shaped model can decrease the value of the flow velocity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_19">Figure 19</xref>, the velocity and discharge graph, clearly shows that the velocity of the Stair-Shaped model is lower than that of the USBR Type III model. The USBR Type III model has a velocity range of 19.17 m/s to 29.80 m/s, whereas the Stair-Shaped model has a velocity range of 17.42 m/s to 28.14 m/s. Thus, it can be inferred that implementing this detrimental model will effectively decrease erosion downstream of the stilling basin.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The USBR Type III stilling and the stair-shaped model should clearly show an association between the water level height during stream flow. The USBR Type III stilling basin, indicated by the blue line, has a maximum water level elevation of +18.58. In contrast, the Stair-Shaped type results (green line) in the greatest water level of +22.95. These results show that the Stair-Shaped model produces a higher water level in the downstream (Y2) stilling basin than the USBR Type III stilling basin model. The water level downstream can help to reduce the energy that occurs due to turbulence in the stilling basin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_22">Figure 22</xref> shows that the energy dissipation ratio graph of the Stair-Shaped model is in the uppermost layer, so it can be concluded that the Stair-Shaped model produces the highest energy dissipation ratio value. With a high energy dissipation ratio value, the stilling basin's energy dissipation performance was the best. These results prove that with the ladder model, the collisions produced by the steps can reduce the flow energy, and the characteristics change to subcritical flow characteristics. Cavitation phenomena can also be avoided because the steps can gradually carry out the momentum of collisions between water particles. If this model is applied, the danger of erosion downstream of the stilling basin and river banks can be avoided.</p>

            <title>3.7. Prototype-scale implementation</title>
          
          <p>The model scale approach to the implementation scale can be done with the hydraulic stepping length (Lj) approach. The hydraulic stepping length formula (Lj) in this research is based on previous research by Elevatorski, Simoes, Riegel, and Beebe, Douma. The results show that the Step Stair model is close to the hydraulic springing condition based on the formula developed by Elevatorski (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_30">Figure 30</xref>), with a skewness value of 7%. Therefore, the hydraulic springing formula for the two stair models can be developed from Elevatorski's model. The formula development can be written as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify">Elevatorski Pond:</p><p style="text-align: justify">Lj = 6.90 (Y2-Y1)</p><p style="text-align: justify">Stair-Shaped Pool Formula Development:</p><p style="text-align: justify">Lj = 6.37 (Y2-Y1)</p><p style="text-align: justify">The hydraulic stepping length (Lj) approach can be used to accomplish the model scale approach to scale implementation. The hydraulic stepping length formula (Lj) used in this study is derived from prior studies conducted by Elevatorski, Simoes, Riegel and Beebe, and Douma. The findings indicate that the Step Stair model closely approximates the hydraulic springing state as determined by the formula devised by Elevatorski (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_30">Figure 30</xref>), with a skewness value of 7%. Thus, the formula for hydraulic springing for the two stair models may be derived from Elevatorski's model. The formulation development can be expressed as follows:</p><p style="text-align: justify">The coefficient formula for calculating the length of the Elevatorski Stilling Basin is Lj=6.90 multiplied by the difference between the Y-coordinates of points Y2 and Y1. Development of the formula for a stilling basin with a stair-shaped:</p><p style="text-align: justify">The equation Lj=6.37 (Y2-Y1) represents the relationship between the length Lj and the difference in the y-coordinates Y2 and Y1.</p>

From these results, it can be concluded that the stair-formed swim pond model development is close to accurate, and it is possible to implement it in dam construction. However, there are limitations to the study in that there are pump power limitations, and it has not been able to model the sediment content in the stream.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The test results on the hydraulic performance and effectiveness of the USBR Type III stilling basin and the Stair-Shaped lead to the following conclusion:</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. The dissipation ratio generated by the Stair-Shaped model is more efficient in lowering flow energy than the USBR Type III model. The USBR Type III has an average energy dissipation ratio of 78.99%. The energy dissipation ratio produced by the Stair-Shaped model is 81.59%. It can be concluded that using a stair-shaped model can increase the energy dissipation ratio by 2.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify">2. The efficiency generated by the stair-shape type model surpasses that of the USBR Type III model. The USBR Type III has an average efficiency of 21.01%, whereas the Stair-Shaped type has an efficiency of 18.41%, resulting in a 2.6% increase. Applying this model can increase efficiency by 2.6% from the USBR Type III model.</p><p style="text-align: justify">3. The velocity of the Stair-Shaped type is lower than that of the USBR Type III variant. The velocity range in the USBR Type III model is 19.17 m/s to 29.80 m/s; however, in the Stair-Shaped type, it is 17.42 m/s to 28.14 m/s. so it can be concluded that with this stair-shaped model, the resulting flow velocity is lower, which can reduce the risk of scouring or scouring in the stilling basin due to high velocity.</p><p style="text-align: justify">4. The highest water level elevation in the USBR Type III ranges +18.58. The highest stair-shaped type of water level is +22.95. Typically, the Stair-Shaped type results in a greater water level. It can be concluded that this stair-shaped model produces a higher water level downstream of the stilling basin than the USBR Type III. This can dissipate flow energy. Hence, the performance of the stair-shaped stilling basin energy dissipator is better than the USBR Type III model.</p>

      <title>5. Recommendation</title>
      <p>Based on the results of this study, researchers in the field of hydraulics who are interested in further study are advised to:</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. Channel slopes with larger discharges must be further studied to produce a more optimal data series.</p><p style="text-align: justify">2. The use of measuring instrument instrumentation for sensor water flow measurements so that more accurate readings are produced.</p><p style="text-align: justify">3. Sediment modeling must be added to be more realistic by existing conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify">4. If this stair-shaped model is developed, it is necessary to conduct a study related to the topographic and geological conditions at the location where the stair-shaped type stilling basin model will be built.</p>
