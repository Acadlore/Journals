      <abstract><p>Accurate and robust image segmentation remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, particularly in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity, noise, and weak object boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a Robust Pythagorean Fuzzy Energy-Based Level Set (RPFELS) model, which integrates a novel fuzzy energy formulation with level set evolution to enhance segmentation precision and resilience against noise. The model introduces a Pythagorean fuzzy divergence term to refine energy optimization, ensuring adaptive boundary preservation and reducing sensitivity to intensity variations. Additionally, a bounded fuzzy energy constraint is incorporated to ensure numerical stability and prevent energy leakage during evolution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including medical and natural images, validate the effectiveness of RPFELS. The model consistently outperforms recent selective segmentation methods in terms of Dice Score, Jaccard Index, and Hausdorff Distance, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and reduced boundary errors. Furthermore, a detailed statistical significance analysis using paired t-tests confirms that the observed improvements are statistically significant (p-value $&lt;$ 0.01), reinforcing the reliability of the proposed approach. Moreover, RPFELS exhibits higher computational efficiency, achieving faster convergence rates compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the robustness and versatility of the proposed approach in handling challenging segmentation scenarios, making it suitable for applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial defect detection. By ensuring bounded energy evolution and statistically validated performance gains, our model sets a new benchmark in selective segmentation.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Image processing is a fundamental area of research in computer vision, playing a vital role in various domains such as medical imaging, remote sensing, industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, and surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. It involves a broad spectrum of computational techniques aimed at enhancing, analyzing, and interpreting visual data. One of the most critical tasks in image processing is image segmentation, which refers to the process of partitioning an image into distinct and meaningful regions. Accurate segmentation facilitates key applications such as object detection, pattern recognition, and scene understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. However, image segmentation remains a challenging problem due to various factors, including noise, illumination variations, occlusions, and the complexity of object boundaries. Therefore, developing robust segmentation models that can effectively handle these challenges is crucial for improving automated visual analysis systems.</p><p>Selective image segmentation is a specialized approach in image processing that focuses on isolating specific objects of interest while disregarding irrelevant background regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. This technique plays a crucial role in various domains, including medical imaging, industrial defect detection, and remote sensing. In medical applications, accurate segmentation of anatomical structures, tumors, or pathological regions is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Similarly, in industrial quality control, selective segmentation enables the precise detection of defects by focusing only on defective areas while ignoring unblemished regions. Furthermore, in satellite and remote sensing imagery, land use and land cover (LULC) classification depends on the accurate segmentation of specific terrain features, such as forests, water bodies, or urban areas, to facilitate environmental monitoring and resource management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Unlike global segmentation techniques, which aim to classify every pixel in an image into different categories, selective segmentation prioritizes target regions, making it more efficient in applications where prior knowledge about the object of interest is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. However, traditional segmentation methods, such as thresholding, edge detection, and region-growing techniques, often struggle with complex backgrounds, overlapping intensity distributions, and noise, which can degrade segmentation accuracy.</p><p>Recent advancements in image segmentation have been significantly influenced by novel computational techniques, including convolution-based models, divergence-driven methods, and multi-level thresholding strategies. These approaches have shown promising results by enhancing segmentation accuracy through improved feature extraction and optimization techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Convolution-based architectures have been particularly effective in capturing spatial relationships within images, facilitating more precise boundary detection and object delineation. Additionally, multi-level thresholding segmentation methods have emerged as a powerful tool in image processing, offering efficient and adaptive segmentation solutions across various applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite the advancements in deep learning and conventional statistical segmentation techniques, fuzzy-based segmentation models continue to play a crucial role in improving segmentation accuracy, adaptability, and robustness across various domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. These models leverage fuzzy logic principles to handle uncertainty, noise, and intensity variations in complex images, making them particularly suitable for medical, remote sensing, and low-light imaging applications. For instance, intelligent fuzzy image segmentation systems have been explored for engineering and pedagogical applications, enhancing automation and precision in professional training environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Similarly, fuzzy similarity measures have been utilized for pattern recognition and image segmentation, offering novel techniques for improving classification accuracy in artificial intelligence-driven applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>In medical imaging, fuzzy entropy-based segmentation approaches have significantly improved automated white matter lesion detection in MRIs, providing an effective tool for diagnosing multiple sclerosis with greater accuracy and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Additionally, fuzzy hybrid meta-optimized learning frameworks have emerged as powerful solutions for medical image segmentation, integrating optimization techniques with fuzzy logic to enhance diagnostic precision and clinical decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. These fuzzy-based models continue to evolve, offering scalable, computationally efficient, and adaptable solutions for diverse segmentation tasks.</p><p>Despite significant advancements in fuzzy-based segmentation models, existing methods often struggle with intensity inhomogeneity, weak edges, and noise, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. Traditional level set approaches suffer from numerical instability, while conventional fuzzy models, including intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval type-2 fuzzy sets, fail to provide adaptive contour evolution for complex images. Moreover, existing fuzzy divergence-based constraints lack a mechanism to prevent over-segmentation while maintaining smooth boundary transitions.</p><p>To address these limitations, we propose a novel selective segmentation model that integrates a Pythagorean fuzzy membership function, a fuzzy divergence operator, and an entropy-regularized energy functional. Unlike intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which rely on a single hesitation degree, Pythagorean fuzzy sets provide a greater degree of flexibility in uncertainty modeling by allowing the squared sum of membership and non-membership values to be at most one. This enhances the ability to capture fine-grained variations in image intensities, leading to superior segmentation performance. Compared to interval type-2 fuzzy sets, which require complex computational operations to handle uncertainty, our approach maintains computational efficiency while preserving segmentation accuracy.</p><p>The proposed model operates by leveraging a Pythagorean fuzzy membership function to ensure a smooth and adaptive transition between the object and background, making it robust to intensity variations. The fuzzy divergence is introduced to regulate boundary evolution, preventing over-segmentation while maintaining contour flexibility. The energy functional integrates region-based, gradient-based, and divergence-based constraints, enabling precise object localization and enhanced boundary preservation. Unlike conventional fuzzy-based segmentation models that struggle with balancing local and global intensity distributions, our entropy-regularized energy functional dynamically adapts to spatial variations, improving robustness against noise and weak edges.</p><p>The segmentation process is guided by an energy minimization framework, where the level set function evolves iteratively to minimize the proposed functional, leading to an optimal partitioning of the image. The integration of Pythagorean fuzzy sets with divergence-driven constraints provides a theoretical advancement over conventional fuzzy segmentation techniques by ensuring better boundary localization, reduced numerical instability, and improved adaptability to complex intensity distributions.</p><p>To ensure the stability and reliability of the model, we establish the boundedness of the proposed energy functional. The energy components, including the region-based term, fuzzy divergence constraint, and gradient regularization, are mathematically formulated to remain within finite bounds under appropriate parameter settings. The bounded nature of the function guarantees that the segmentation process does not diverge, ensuring convergence to a stable solution. This property is crucial for maintaining numerical stability and preventing excessive contour deformation during optimization. By proving the boundedness, we confirm that the proposed model provides a well-posed and computationally efficient framework for selective image segmentation, making it suitable for complex real-world applications.</p>

This term ensures smoothness in the segmentation boundaries, preventing abrupt transitions that may lead to over-segmentation. The fourth term represents the fuzzy divergence constraint, which prevents excessive segmentation fragmentation and ensures robust boundary evolution.

          <p>Since \( F(\phi) \) is assumed to belong to the Sobolev space \( W^{1,p}(\Omega) \), it follows that \( \| \nabla F(\phi) \|_{L^p(\Omega)} \) is bounded, ensuring that \( E_4 \) remains finite.</p><p>Thus, all terms in \( E(\phi) \) are bounded, confirming that the energy functional remains well-defined and stable under the given function space assumptions.</p><p>Thus, since each term is bounded, the entire energy functional \( E(\phi) \) is bounded. Thus, since the proposed energy functional is bounded, the segmentation results are stable and robust against noise and intensity variations. The bounded nature ensures well-defined energy minimization, leading to precise object-background separation while preserving structural details. This property enhances the adaptability of the model to complex images, ensuring reliable segmentation performance across diverse scenarios.</p>

      <title>4. Experimental results</title>
      <p>To validate the effectiveness of the fuzzy energy-based segmentation model, extensive experiments were conducted on a diverse dataset, including the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS500) for natural image segmentation, synthetic images for controlled complexity analysis, and medical imaging datasets comprising MRI and X-ray scans to evaluate performance in clinical applications. These datasets encompass varying levels of texture complexity, noise, and intensity inhomogeneity, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of the model's robustness. All images were resized to $255\times255$ to maintain consistency in evaluation. The proposed model was implemented in MATLAB R2016, utilizing numerical optimization techniques for level set evolution. The segmentation performance was compared against state-of-the-art competing models, including Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] and Yue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], using well-established quantitative metrics such as Dice Score, Jaccard Index, and Hausdorff Distance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving more precise object-background separation while preserving fine structural details across different imaging modalities.</p><p>The parameter setup plays a critical role in optimizing the performance of the proposed fuzzy energy-based segmentation model. To achieve the best results, appropriate values for the parameters \( \lambda_1 \), \( \lambda_2 \), \( \gamma \), \( \eta \), and \( p \) must be carefully selected based on the characteristics of the input images. The region-based energy parameters \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) are typically chosen in a balanced manner, where higher values (\( \lambda_1 = 1.0 \), \( \lambda_2 = 1.0 \)) ensure effective object-background separation while maintaining contrast robustness. The gradient-based regularization term \( \gamma \) is set within the range of \( 0.01 \leq \gamma \leq 0.1 \) to control boundary smoothness without overly penalizing fine details. The fuzzy divergence weight \( \eta \) is crucial for controlling segmentation flexibility and preventing over-segmentation; an optimal range of \( 0.05 \leq \eta \leq 0.2 \) is suggested based on empirical evaluations. The exponent \( p \) in the fuzzy divergence operator determines the strength of boundary regularization, where \( p = 1.2 \) is recommended to strike a balance between contour adaptability and smoothness enforcement. Additionally, the smoothness parameter \( \alpha \) in the Pythagorean fuzzy membership function is set between \( 0.5 \leq \alpha \leq 2.0 \), ensuring an adaptive transition for object-background separation without introducing excessive blurring.</p>
      <p>The optimal parameter values were determined through extensive experimentation on benchmark medical and natural image datasets, considering segmentation accuracy, robustness against noise, and computational efficiency. By tuning these parameters adaptively based on image complexity, the proposed model achieves superior segmentation performance, effectively preserving object boundaries and enhancing segmentation precision in challenging imaging scenarios.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the sequential process of image segmentation using the proposed model. The first column presents the given input image, which serves as the initial reference for segmentation. The second column shows the initialization of the contour, highlighting the preliminary boundary selection crucial for accurate segmentation. In the third column, the fuzzy localization process is depicted, where the model adapts to intensity variations and structural details, refining the segmentation region. The final column displays the segmentation result obtained using the proposed model, showcasing its ability to preserve object boundaries while effectively distinguishing between different regions. This visualization demonstrates the robustness of the proposed approach in accurately segmenting complex structures, making it suitable for applications in medical imaging, remote sensing, and industrial vision systems.</p>

      <p>The second column illustrates the segmentation result obtained using the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].

Although the model improves upon Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] in certain regions, it still suffers from boundary leakage and inaccuracies due to the high intensity inhomogeneity within the images. The segmentation contours deviate from the actual object boundaries, leading to potential misclassification of pixels.</p><p>The final column displays the segmentation result obtained using the proposed model. The proposed method effectively handles non-uniform intensity variations and noise, ensuring robust and precise boundary localization.

The images are arranged into four columns, each representing a different stage of segmentation.

These initial contours serve as the foundation for the segmentation process. The second column presents the segmentation results obtained using the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. The blue contours highlight the segmented regions identified by this model. While some regions are accurately detected, there are noticeable inaccuracies, such as boundary leakage and incomplete segmentation, suggesting that struggles with intensity variations and noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. In the third column, the segmentation results of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] are displayed. Compared to study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], this model shows slightly better alignment with the target regions, but it still exhibits inconsistencies in contour precision. Some areas appear over-segmented, while others remain under-segmented, indicating that lacks robustness in handling complex structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. The last column presents the segmentation results obtained using the proposed model. The blue contours in this column demonstrate significantly improved accuracy in capturing the target regions. The proposed method effectively preserves structural integrity, aligns well with actual boundaries, and reduces noise-related errors. The contours appear smoother and more precise, suggesting that the model successfully handles intensity variations and complex textures.</p>

The proposed model offers enhanced boundary adherence, noise reduction, and structural preservation, making it a more reliable choice for medical image segmentation. The improved segmentation performance suggests that the proposed approach is well-suited for applications requiring high accuracy, such as medical diagnostics and analysis.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the robustness of the proposed segmentation model against different initial contour placements. The four subfigures depict the evolution of segmentation results, starting from different initial contours, yet all cases ultimately converge to the same final segmentation. This behavior highlights the model’s stability and insensitivity to initialization, ensuring consistent results regardless of the initial contour positioning. Such robustness is particularly beneficial in real-world applications where precise initialization may not always be feasible. The proposed model effectively adapts to intensity variations and object boundaries, leading to accurate and reliable segmentation outcomes.</p>

          <p>where, \( A \) represents the predicted segmentation and \( B \) represents the ground truth. A higher Dice Score indicates a better match between the segmentation result and the actual object boundaries. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, the proposed model achieves a Dice Score of 0.96, significantly outperforming Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] (0.87) and Yue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] (0.90). This improvement, validated by statistical tests (p-value $&lt;$ 0.01), confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately segmenting the target regions.</p>

          <p>Unlike the Dice Score, which gives more weight to common regions, the Jaccard Index provides a stricter evaluation by considering the total region covered by both segmentations. A higher value indicates better segmentation performance. The proposed model achieves a Jaccard Index of 0.92, compared to 0.81 for Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] and 0.85 for Yue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], demonstrating superior segmentation accuracy. The improvements in this metric are statistically significant with p-value $&lt;$ 0.01, reinforcing the reliability of the proposed approach.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>We proposed a Robust Pythagorean Fuzzy Energy-Based Level Set (RPFELS) that integrates advanced fuzzy segmentation techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. The model leverages the Pythagorean fuzzy membership function to provide a smooth and adaptive transition for object-background separation, effectively handling intensity, inhomogeneity, and weak edges. Additionally, the introduction of a fuzzy divergence ensures well-regularized contour evolution, preventing over-segmentation while maintaining precise boundary localization. Our proposed energy functional incorporates entropy-based regularization and a fuzzy divergence constraint, balancing object-background separation while preserving structural integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperformed existing methods by achieving higher segmentation accuracy, as evidenced by superior Dice Score and Jaccard Index values. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the Hausdorff Distance, indicating improved boundary precision, while also lowering computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p><p>Despite the promising performance of the proposed model, it has certain limitations that need to be addressed in future research. One major limitation is its sensitivity to parameter selection, as improper tuning of fuzzy energy parameters may lead to suboptimal segmentation results. Additionally, the computational complexity, while reduced compared to conventional level set models, still poses a challenge for real-time applications, especially when handling high-resolution images or large datasets. Another limitation is the model’s reliance on pre-defined initialization, which may affect segmentation accuracy if the initial contour is placed incorrectly. Furthermore, while the proposed model effectively handles intensity inhomogeneity, its performance may degrade when dealing with extremely low-contrast images or highly complex textures.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, future work will focus on adaptive parameter optimization techniques, such as deep learning-based hyperparameter tuning, to enhance the model’s robustness across diverse image conditions. Computational efficiency can be further improved by implementing GPU acceleration and parallel processing techniques. Additionally, integrating an automatic contour initialization mechanism using deep learning-based object detection methods can enhance the reliability of segmentation results.</p>
