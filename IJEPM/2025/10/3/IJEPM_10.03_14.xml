      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The global energy transition requires a drastic reduction in fossil fuels dependence in favor of renewable energy sources. These sources, although clean and abundant, exhibit variability and intermittency that complicates their massive integration into current electricity grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. In the absence of effective storage solutions, this variability harms the stability of the electricity system and limits the optimal use of these energies.</p><p>The Energy International Agency 2022 report states that the number of people living without electricity has increased for the first time in more than a decade. 685 million people did not have access to electricity in 2022, 10 million more than in 2021. Among them, 570 million live in sub-Saharan Africa, which thus concentrates more than 80% of the world's population without electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. The case of the Cameroonian energy system also experiences an imbalance between supply and demand, despite considerable hydraulic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. This alarming energy deficit (more than 40% of households do not have access to electricity in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]) could be attributed to the virtual non-existence of comprehensive studies to assess energy potential. This tool is essential and helps public authorities make decisions. We must also add the climate crisis, which is clearly the result of human activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>Speaking of the climate crisis, the national report on climate and development published by the World Bank on November 5, 2022 deplores that climate change directly impacts more than 70% of the population whose livelihoods depend directly on agriculture. In recent years, Cameroon has made progress in developing climate plans and policy documents to integrate climate change into its sectoral strategies. The socio-economic impact of climate change shocks affects nearly 40% of vulnerable households. Over the past 20 years, the country has reduced its emissions through reforestation and by changing its energy mix in favor of renewable energy. This results in emissions reductions from 9.32 tonnes of carbon dioxide per capita in 1998 to 4.89 tonnes in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy and at the same time meet the requirements of preserving biodiversity, PSP-system seem adequate. The idea is to build a higher reservoir to store the water, and a lower one to receive this water which falls and must be reused several times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the literature, only a few studies are conducted. Djongyang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] and Nouadje et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] hypothetically assessed the wind potential in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In addition, Tchinda and Kaptouom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] analyzed wind speeds and energy distributions in the Adamawa and Northern Regions of Cameroon. Nfah and Ngundam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] identified stakeholders for sustainable growth of renewable energy in Cameroon. Arreyndip et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] carry out a wind energy assessment of Cameroon’s coastal regions for the installation of an onshore wind farm. Abanda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] studied the potential, benefits, and enabling environment of renewable energy sources in Cameroon. Kaoga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] performed a statistical analysis of wind speed distribution using six Weibull methods to assess wind generation in the Northern Region. Kenfack-Sadem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] made up of the south, Littoral, central, west and south west potential of the wind energy in Cameroon based on weibull, normal and lognormal distribution. Kaoga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] assessed the potential of wind energy for water pumping at scale and concluded that the potential in the Northern Region of Cameroon is not suitable for electricity generation. Speaking of energy storage in the form of water, some studies have already been conducted in the context of domestic operation powered by solar panels ; in particular Pali and Vadhera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] proposed system comprises of a solar photovoltaic (SPV) system, solar water pump, pico-hydro turbine-generator and pumped-hydro energy storage system.

To this end, a question deserves to be asked, that of knowing how to optimize the storage of wind energy in the energy context of Cameroon?</p><p>The aim of the work is to model a renewable energy storage solution (wind-PSP) and evaluate its efficiency in an energy system powered mainly by intermittent renewable sources such as wind power in the context of Cameroon.</p><p>The study is divided into three sections; the section entitled materials and methods is devoted to the presentation of the tools, software, data collected, and the description of the wind energy storage system chosen. The experimental method deployed for measuring the flow rate of the watercourse in the study area is developed to meet the topographical conditions. Section two focuses on the various simulation and experimental results of the proposed and developed energy storage system. A summary of a study is drawn up as a conclusion to the work, which ends with elements of perspectives.</p>

          <p>The proposed system with pumped storage is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. The main components of the system include a power generator (wind turbine), an energy storage subsystem (pumped storage with two reservoirs, pumps, and turbines/generators), a user (load), and a control station. The entire system is regulated by the control center, which is the critical element of the overall load management and power distribution system. </p><p>Diurnal and seasonal variations in wind direction and speed were taken into account with meteorological data that integrate favorable wind directions as well as minimum and maximum speeds reached in the measured region.</p><p>The strategies and control logic of the actual operation were not considered in this study because the scope of study was restricted to the evaluation of producible power due to the flow of water from one height to another at the turbine inlet. In addition, an assumption of water as a perfect fluid is made. Hence the control logic in this context cannot have a significant impact on the system</p><p>Three-blade wind turbines are the most used because they offer better regularity and better balance of the rotor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>]. Horizontal axis wind turbines can also be classified according to the direction of incidence of the wind. In this case, turbines upstream of the wind for which the wind hits the blades directly and turbines downstream of the wind for which the wind hits the back of the blades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>].</p>

          <p>Pumped storage system modeling is dependent on meteorological data in our context, with the use of wind power to pump water. In this study, the available meteorological data are those of the coastal region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. The topography of the coastal region suggests areas of steep slopes in the Moungo department as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. This is the reason that led to the study of the Nkongsamba site, which, with its elevation differences ranging from 200 m to 2300 m (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>), is a suitable area for a pumped storage system using wind power. The limitation in the choice of regions is mainly due to obtaining meteorological data.</p><p> The sustainable use of water resources in Cameroon in determining reservoir capacity and water flow in Cameroon begins with the description of the study area under the heading "Relief and Hydrography." This includes listing the main watershed, its tributaries, and the main rivers flowing from them.</p>

The actual data exhibit a slight disparity due to the form factor which is high after determining the Weibull parameters. Hence the actual data are approximately consistent with the distribution assumptions with a negligible margin of error. However, to obtain a reliable assessment of the average speed and its variance at a given point, approximately ten years of measurements are required. Finding a method describing wind behavior based on a much shorter (annual) measurement period is advisable. Research able to establish that the most appropriate method is the two-parameter Weibull function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p><p>Weibull Distribution</p><p>The choice of the Weibull model is justified by the literature because of its reliability for its two-parameter model.</p><p>In the Weibull distribution, wind speed variations are characterized by two functions: the probability density function and the distribution function.</p>

          <p>Regarding the float method used to measure river flow, irregularity is taken into account through the plurality (at least three) of flow velocity measurements. On the other hand, the influence of morphology is not taken into account by assuming the natural flow of water. The application of a correction coefficient is integrated into the float method to compensate for measurement uncertainties and errors. When the float passes the observer, the timer is started and stopped when it passes the marker downstream. At least three successive measurements should be taken. Therefore, the surface speed is:</p>

          <p>In the context of gravitational storage of wind energy, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the temporal profile and variability of wind speed. This allows for the appropriate sizing of pumping and water retention infrastructure use in gravitational storage, this involves wind speed data collection and data extrapolation hourly or daily at the site under study, estimating the parameters $k<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>c$ using the maximum likelihood method.</p><p>Weibull distribution fitting is a commonly used method to model wind speed distribution and estimate the wind potential of a site. Once the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) are found using the Newton Raphson algorithm (Eq. (23)) in MATLAB software, it is possible to plot the fitted Weibull distribution density curve in MATLAB over the frequency histogram. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows the fitting of a Weibull density function to the wind speed distribution in m/s.</p>

          <p>The curve describes on the one hand a histogram of wind speeds on the frequencies of occurrence. When observing this figure, we can note that at the level of the coast, i.e. for an altitude of 3 m maximum above sea level, the wind speeds are low; [0, 2] m/s with the highest frequencies of the order of 3. The higher we go in altitude, the more the speed increase as well as their frequency of occurrence.</p><p>On the other hand, the adjustment curve of the Weibull density function reveals 03 slopes. A first increasing slope for speeds ranging from [0, 5] m/s; this is an operation of the wind turbine with a low wind regime that cannot cause any major failure. A slightly constant slope for speeds ranging from [$5<inline-formula>

            <title>4.2. Determination of the available power and flow rate of the wind storage-psp system</title>
          
          <p>The evaluation of the efficiency of the wind-PSP system in this study was restricted to the evaluation of the power producible at the turbine inlet linked to the water flow. The pipes and turbines were not integrated because they did not have an experimental device. It is in this context that a perfect fluid hypothesis is considered for water with pipe and turbine devices not causing energy losses. Losses are not ignored; the study is just restricted to the power producible at the turbine inlet.</p><p>From Eq. (6) for the determination of the wind turbine power at different altitudes which is the equivalent of the pumped storage power and Eq. (3) for the determination of the flow rate; implemented in ArcGIS and Matlab/Simulink software, the operation of the pumped storage system could be simulated. The first results are thus based on the flow rate, the available power, the reservoir capacity and the turbined volume per kilowatt-hour of energy produced.</p><p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> shows the flow rate and turbine power as a function of the elevation. </p><p>The three-dimensional curve suggests a linear correlation between elevation, power, and flow rate. The higher the elevation, the greater the available power, and consequently the flow rate. This simulation predicts a production capacity ranging from 4 MW to 24 MW. The flow rate from the upper reservoir to the lower reservoir varies from 2 L/s to 13 L/s for wind turbines located at altitudes ranging from 200 m to 2300 m.</p>

This large gap can be explained by the fact that in Rossi's work, pump-turbine technology (PAT) is used for very small hydraulic or energy recovery applications. These machine tools are adapted in water distribution networks to adjust pressure levels and produce electricity. This gap could also be explained by the difference in topography between the two PSP sites and by the difference in energy source, which is the wind turbine in the context of this work.</p>

The difference in topographic profiles between the sites, as well as the storage capacities, may also explain the different observed differences.

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The proposed work consisted to model a renewable energy storage solution and evaluate its efficiency in an energy system powered mainly by intermittent renewable sources such as wind power in the context of Cameroon. The research explored gravity-based water storage through pumped-storage power stations (wind-PSP).</p><p>To achieve this, a set of mathematical and statistical models was implemented, including the Weibull distribution. This Weibull distribution used the collected annual meteorological data, extrapolated them, and established the Weibull fitting law.</p><p>The wind turbine power, Bernoulli flow model and simulation in dedicated applications assessed the flow rate, required water capacity, power output, and available energy quantities in the study area. In the study area (Nkongsamba, Cameroon), an average energy potential of 12 MWh for the wind power-PSP system was estimated for two water reservoirs with capacities of $95 \mathrm{~m}^3<inline-formula>
