      <p>Dear editors, reviewers, authors, readers, and other members of the whole scientific and professional community,</p><p></p><p>Welcome to this inaugural issue of the Mechatronics and Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS).</p><p>Today, in the 21st century, the biggest driver of technology development is the integration of multiple disciplines through the improvement of human-technology interaction. The mechatronics highly integrated approach creates smart and efficient solutions for a wide range of high-tech engineering problems through multidisciplinarity combining three engineering fields: mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. Also, the development field of Intelligent Transportation Systems or Smart Transportation combines transportation systems with control systems of intelligent vehicles, mechanical engineering for transportation, intelligent transportation infrastructure, and e-transportation.</p><p>The purpose of the Mechatronics and Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS) Journal is to promote science and research leading to improved transportation system planning and operation using new mechatronic technologies, as well as to be a reliable source of material for publications or innovative methodologies and solutions with a synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering, and intelligent machine control systems in the field of transport.</p><p>This first issue aims to give answers to many important questions related to the scope of the journal and consists of seven very interesting high-quality papers: Article 1 provides a reference for the design of maglev trains, controllers, and tracks, laying a theoretical basis for the maintenance of maglev commercial lines; Article 2 focuses on design and testing of cooperative motion controller for UAV-UGV System; Article 3 studies modeling of operating speeds as a function of longitudinal gradient in local conditions on two-lane roads; Article 4 highlighted Field Tests and Analyses on running Stability of Fenghuang medium and low-speed maglev train; Articles 5 analyzing curve negotiation dynamics of side-suspended high-temperature superconducting maglev system; Article 6 focusing on pavement condition assessment using pavement condition index and multi-criteria decision-making model, and Article 7 presenting design configuration and technical application of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.</p><p>Mechatronics and Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS) Journal provides a chance for researchers around the world to showcase their creative thinking and innovative solutions and it welcomes original submissions in various forms, including reviews, regular research papers, and short communications as well as Special Issues on particular topics.</p><p>Through promoting the theory, practice, and interdisciplinary aspects of systems science and engineering, our goals are to provide help create a better environment and promote the benefits of mechatronic and intelligent systems among the public at large.</p>
