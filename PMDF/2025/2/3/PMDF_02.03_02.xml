      <abstract><p>The design of automatic clamping mechanisms often involves trade-offs between clamping stability, structural compactness, manufacturability, and operational reliability. These trade-offs are difficult to handle in early design stages, where decisions are largely experience-based and design alternatives are not yet fully defined. An integrated design approach combining Extenics and TRIZ is applied to support the innovative development and structural optimization of an automatic clamping mechanism. Functional requirements and structural constraints are first expressed in the form of Extenics element models. Key design conflicts are then identified through functional analysis and addressed using TRIZ contradiction principles and inventive principles, which guide the generation of alternative structural configurations. The candidate designs are evaluated with respect to mechanical performance, manufacturability, and structural feasibility in order to select a configuration that better satisfies practical engineering requirements. The approach is illustrated through the redesign of an automatic clamping mechanism. The results show that the selected configuration improves clamping stability and structural reliability while maintaining reasonable manufacturability. The study suggests that the combined use of Extenics and TRIZ can support systematic innovation in mechanical structure design and provide practical guidance for similar precision engineering applications.</p></abstract>

Using innovative methods to solve difficult problems in mechanical product design and obtain innovative product solutions is an important way to achieve mechanical product design.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] and Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] have made beneficial explorations. However, they only used element descriptions and their extensions/transformation in the processes of component analysis and component interaction analysis, and did not establish functional models based on element expressions, or established structural models, which makes it difficult to accurately locate functional defects, limiting the extension of objects. This paper uses element descriptions for the entire functional analysis process and functional models, establishing a mechanical design method based on functional Extenics (the functional and functional models of components with Extenics expressions). This extends the divergent pathways of functional models, laying the foundation for quickly obtaining more design solutions. This method is particularly suitable for mechanical system design scenarios that require system reconstruction at the functional level while considering structural implementation and manufacturing feasibility.</p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif">The functional Extenics method proposed in this paper establishes a complete functional Extenics method system, which is a significant improvement over Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Zhang Wenlin et al. only established a functional relationship diagram using event and relational elements, without building a complete functional model with element expressions, thus limiting the extension of objects. Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] built a functional structure diagram instead of component analysis and functional models. They only extended event elements, which made it difficult to obtain functional defects and multiple element extension objects. A single functional model mainly aims to acquire functional defects, but it is hard to find solutions to problems. Likewise, a single Extenics innovation method can only extend elements in structures and cannot identify functional defects, making the extension objects insufficient. Therefore, a functional model based on element expressions can effectively expand the extension objects and generate more creative paths for Extenics transformations, laying the foundation for generating more creative solutions. This framework helps form a more systematic functional reconstruction and structural generation mechanism in precision mechanical design and complex structural system development, thereby supporting more efficient mechanical structure innovation and engineering optimization.</p>

      <title>2. Element description of function model</title>
      <p>A function model is a graphical description of functional analysis, representing the functions and interactions between different components. According to the function model, it can only identify functional defects, and the solutions generated to correct these defects are few. If the element model is used to describe the characteristics and values of the functions, components, and structural relationships, it is beneficial for further expansion analysis. The function analysis mainly involves component analysis, component interaction analysis, and function modeling. Each stage is described using the element model.</p>

          <p>A matter element is the basic unit that describes an object, using features and corresponding values to describe the internal attributes of the object. The component analysis in the function analysis process is the analysis of an object, and this component analysis process can be described using the matter element model. According to the original model, the main parts are divided into three levels: the current system, system components, and super-system components. The specific division is as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>The structural relationships between components are described using relation elements, which describe the relationship attributes using features and their corresponding values. The component interaction analysis in function analysis is the analysis of the interaction relationships between components. This is described in two steps: first, using relation elements to describe whether there is a connection between the components, i.e., whether there is a contact relationship; then using matter elements to describe the specific nature of the action.</p><p>The first step of component interaction analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. For components with interactions, the relation elements are given where they intersect.</p>

The function model here combines the advantages of graphical and element formalization.

          <p>TRIZ theory’s function modeling can only distinguish between insufficient, excessive, and harmful functions. Solutions are then focused on these functional defects, making it difficult to generate many solutions. However, after using element modeling, solutions can be sought through extension analysis of the elements, and because there are many extension methods, a large number of solutions can be generated. This is the advantage of combining the two methods.</p>

      <p>By integrating the advantages of functional analysis and Extenics innovation methods, a mechanical innovation design method based on functional Extenics is constructed. The process is divided into four main stages: problem identification, problem analysis, problem solving, and creative evaluation. Each stage can be further divided into several steps. The specific process of mechanical innovation design based on functional Extenics is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

              <p>The goal of product innovation design is to meet the needs of users or the market. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the needs of users or the market and the functions and characteristics of the original product. The application, working conditions, and performance of the original product should be clearly described. By comparing the functions and characteristics of similar products, the direction of optimization is determined.</p>

The total function should be decomposed, clearly expressing the relationships between the structural elements of the system and the role of this structure in the system. Then, analyze the existing product function structure to determine the relationships between functions. This analysis lays the logical foundation for subsequent component analysis, component interaction analysis, and element description.</p><p>(b) Component Matter Element Description: According to the results of system decomposition, the problematic parts are divided into the current system, subsystems, and super-systems. Then, an element model is created for the components involved, achieving a matter element-based Extenics description of the components.</p><p>(c) Structural Relationship Element Description: A matrix analysis is performed for the interactions between the components, determining their interaction relationships. For those with structural connections, a structural relationship element model is established, realizing the Extenics description of the structural relationship elements.</p><p>(d) Functional Matter Element Description: A function analysis table is created based on the functional elements of the interactions between components, including key factors such as carriers, receptors, structural relationships, and functional levels, achieving the Extenics description of functional matter elements.</p><p>(e) Function Modeling: Based on the above, an element-based function model is established to describe the components, relationships, and mutual functions, including information on components, interactions, and structural relationships within the product, realizing the element description of the function model (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, to identify the core problems (i.e., functional deficiencies, harmful function defects, etc., or contradiction issues).</p>

          <p>Creative evaluation is the final stage of innovative optimization design, aiming to select the most suitable creative solution from numerous ideas to serve as the final design. During the evaluation process, first, determine evaluation indicators, then set the weighting coefficients, calculate the degree of correlation and standardized correlation (to avoid calculating standardized correlation, the value range of correlation can be limited to [-1, 1], as shown in Eq. (8)), and finally, according to Eq. (9), obtain the quality of each creative solution. The creative idea with the highest quality is chosen as the final implementation solution.</p>

          <p>The above schemes can reduce scratches on the workpiece surface (from circular hinge holes to waist-shaped holes, allowing movement between rods at the hinge, thus reducing relative sliding between the clamping jaws and the workpiece), while maintaining enough stroke to clamp the workpiece. These solutions can address the issues identified in the functional analysis. Note: Only four schemes are listed here; in fact, many more schemes can be generated through transformations, but due to space limitations, the transformations and other schemes are not detailed.</p>

            <title>4.6. Scheme evaluation</title>
          
          <p>For the numerous creative solutions, an evaluation needs to be performed to select the optimal one for detailed design. Based on the conclusions from the functional analysis, harmful and insufficient effects are eliminated (i.e., reducing sliding of the clamping jaws on the workpiece surface and increasing the clamping force). Since the relative sliding of the clamping jaws on the workpiece surface can be compensated through <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> after addition), so the sliding is zero for these solutions and is no longer considered as an evaluation indicator. Therefore, the evaluation indicators selected are relative cost (increased cost/original cost), relative clamping force (increased clamping force/original clamping force), and adjustable distance. Five experts from the mechanical industry scored the relative importance of these indicators, determining the weights for each indicator as 0.35 , 0.32 , and 0.33 , respectively. The evaluation values for each indicator are calculated based on the number of modified components and mechanical and geometric calculations (normalized), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>. The quality value is then calculated using Eq. (5). The evaluation reveals that Creative idea 2 has the highest quality value, and it can be selected for detailed structural design.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>The application of innovation methods is key to mechanical product innovation design. Integrating various innovative methods brings together the advantages of these methods and plays an important role in mechanical innovation design. This paper integrates TRIZ theory’s functional analysis with Extenics innovation methods to construct a mechanical innovation design method based on functional Extenics. Based on demand analysis and problem clarification, a product function model is constructed using element description. Through extension analysis of the core problem’s related element models, as many creative paths as possible are generated. These are further transformed into creative solutions via Extenics transformations and evaluated for quality, with the highest quality solution selected for further design. This method can effectively improve the efficiency and breadth of mechanical innovation design and help form a more systematic and traceable structural generation and optimization path in complex mechanical systems, supporting reasonable configuration and performance improvement of mechanical structures.</p><p>This method is mainly applied to the improvement of existing products (i.e., optimizing or improving the shortcomings of existing products), as the function model is easier to construct based on the current product. There are no limitations in applying this method to the improvement of existing products; any existing product can have a function model built and core issues identified. This method is particularly suitable for mechanical product design and optimization scenarios involving multi-functional coupling, multi-constraint conditions, and precise structural configurations. It helps achieve performance enhancement while meeting manufacturability and structural reliability requirements.</p><p>Further, the method can be integrated with artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency of designers in obtaining product improvement solutions. Future work will explore embedding this method into computer-aided design and manufacturing environments to achieve integration with existing design processes and engineering data systems, thus enhancing the operability and application value of this method in engineering practice.</p>
