      <p>At the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, teachers of educated people Nakhchivan wanted to remove people from ignorance and prejudices and found ways to help the development of cultural progress and methods of their education. Almost at the end of the nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth century, both in Azerbaijan and in Nakhchivan, the history of popular education begins with the approval of the charter.</p><p>It should be noted in general that, at the end of the 19th and beginning of the twentieth century in the Nakhchivan region, acting in all schools and madrassas scientific work in the Caucasus in 1873 on November 22, a new law and more developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abbasov, 2007</xref>) was adopted. The State Historical Archive of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which I received on the training of the Caucasian Department in the 1896-1897 academic years, was trained by 55,592 students. Another source in 1894, people living in 2,886,000 Muslims on average 438 people, (of these 9 girls), 578 people in the city, 2,336 people continued their education in public schools.</p><p>It should be noted that, the Caucasus Department presented the Caucasian military leader of the annual report in 1867 Work at the Muslim schools and students who are studying there, the approximate number of students could not determine because there are many number of their number.

Of these, 11 are in villages and two in cities.

Almost, only 1904 in the Nakhchivan region, the number of schools increased from 13 to 29. Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences, Professor Ibrahim Mollaev showed that at the beginning of the twentieth century 1,500 students will be accepted to study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Mollaev, 1983</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that, at the end of the nineteenth and at the beginning of the twentieth century, state and religious schools existed in Nakhchivan.

For this reason, at the beginning of the twentieth century in Nakhchivan, the literacy level decreased to 2 percent of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Akhmedov, 2014</xref>).

In the House of Haji Najaf Zeynalov, the comedy Mirza Fatali Akhundov Musier Zordan and Darwish Mastali was shown and this begins the year of birth of the theater in Nakhchyan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Gahramanov, 2008</xref>).</p><p>At the end of the XIX and at the beginning of the twentieth century, the capitalist method of production in Nakhchivan and in Azerbaijan will achieve the formation and development of art of painting influenced the course of national culture. It is important to note that the development of painting in Nakhchivan of hirlors were indispensable. One of the main representatives of Nakhchivan was the famous artist Bahruz Kangarley.

The main musical art was in two directions. The first direction of Ashig Hananda, the second direction is formed under the influence of Russian culture of new musical art.</p><p>From the above facts it is clear that at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, all types of culture developed in Nakhchivan. During this period, all types of culture developed in Nakhchivan. During this period, writers, actors, architects and artists played an important role not only in Azerbaijan, but throughout the world.

So the decision to open the seminary several times presented the king, but it was impossible to open it. It is clear from the documents that the State Archive of the Republic of Azerbaijan was allowed to open the seminary in 1875 on April 8. Despite this, the seminary only in 1876 on September 12 was approved the charter, but after five months of the year, he was able to start work.</p>
