      <abstract><p>This study presents a detailed Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, focusing on optimizing laminar flow within non-circular ducts, specifically those with square, rectangular, and triangular configurations. The study centers on the effective use of mesh quality and size in these ducts, a factor which is previously underrepresented in those CFD studies that predominantly emphasized turbulent rather than laminar flows. With the help of finite element approach, this study compares the performance of these non-circular ducts, employing Reynolds numbers ranging from 1600 to 2000 and mesh sizes of 6, 12, and 18 mm. A ribbed duct style, arranged in a hybrid manner, is adopted to further this study. Analysis in this paper applied the Single predictive optimization (SPO) technique to the identification of the K-$\varepsilon$-Standard as the preferred viscosity model and a hybrid rib distribution as optimal within the triangular duct configuration. Parameters of a Reynolds number of 1600 and a mesh size of 18 mm emerged as the most effective values for this duct style. Then, the attained results of the Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated the F-Criterion's insignificance for Reynolds laminar levels, rendering the laminar viscosity model less relevant within the test section. Additionally, the implementation of the Six sigma procedure (SSP) markedly enhanced both the performance factor (PF) and turbulence intensity, which were observed at 4.90% and 146.77%, respectively. This improvement was most notable in the triangular duct, characterized by rib heights of 66 mm (semi-circle), 66 mm (rectangular), and 38.126 mm (triangular).</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Numerous flow duct types have been exposed to different studies owing to the wide range of applications utilized in heat flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. It also highlighted the influence of heat transmission in these ducts, where it has been dealt with both the passive and active mechanisms of this transmission. As it is known, the passive mechanism has been preferred in the flow duct since it generates swirls near the transferring surface and has little energy consumption compared to other types. Therefore, researchers have strived to enhance this field by adopting effective designs for the ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>The geometric shape of the ducts is considered one of the most important determinants that affect flow and heat transfer, besides determining the force required for fluid flow through these ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. It was observed that entropy generation was a sign of flow quality when specifying the best style of duct shape. Therefore, circular and triangular ducts have better performance in entropy generation compared to square and rectangular ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Also, the triangular duct has the lowest irreversible and coefficient of shape ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], which means it creates the least amount of entropy and helps heat transfer grow more than other duct styles. This brief description of smooth duct performance has clarified entropy's role in the flow of these ducts. However, the researchers especially strived to enhance the heat flow of non-circular ducts by adding ribs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>As a revolutionary solution, the ducts added ribs or grooves at any wall of the duct walls to generate vortices and boost boundary layers by improving the heat flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. This modification has contributed to raising the Nusselt (Nu) number level and skin friction coefficient. The main reason for this outcome was to separate the flow by ribs, reconfigure, and generate a secondary flow, which enhanced the fluid flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Designally, ribs were divided into hybrid and identical, where hybrid ribs had better thermal efficiency than other types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. In addition, it separated the flux and re-binding and improved the Nusselt number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Subsequently, in calculating entropy, its value in rib ducts is less than that of smooth due to the increase in the heat transfer rate in the thermal system. On the other hand, rib ducts have a better PF than smooth ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, the role of hybrid ribbed tubes in the thermal transfer process is clear compared to other cases of ducts.</p><p>In smooth and ribbed ducts, the performance of heat flow was diverse depending on the Reynolds (Re) number level. In other words, the laminar, transient, and turbulent flow behaviors in these ducts have been reported by prior studies depending on this number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. In the early studies, the heat flow of non-circular smooth ducts was gradient at 1000 <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> 2000 and tended to be stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. In the same way, the Re number has significantly influenced energy loss as the growth of this number induced the wall temperature to drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Similarly, as the Reynolds number advances, the Nu number rises, and the skin friction factor decreases. Hence, this is due to the growth in turbulence in the flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The consequence of laminar flow in the smooth ducts has simultaneously reduced the heat transfer rate and coefficient of friction for non-circular tubes compared to circular ones, while in turbulent flow, the values were almost equal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Besides, the ribs led to the separation of the flow and the formation of a stagnation zone, which caused a decrease in the Nu number. Therefore, a rise in the Re number caused a decrease in this region and improved the local Nu number due to an augmentation in this number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. By essential, these brief outcomes referred to the performance of the flow duct being differentiated when the Re number approximated over 1000. Moreover, these performance levels were consistently very close at Re = 2000.</p><p>These results show that mesh quality and element size were two more factors that affected how well the CFD analysis predicted the design of the heat flow duct in tubes. Unfortunately, numerous studies in this field have not highlighted the mesh intensity based on the finite element method (FEM) and have not deepened interest in these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Wherein mesh size is essential for confining the accuracy of the outcomes and computational time for simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. One of the momentous studies has explored the dominant role of mesh besides the numbers Nu and Re in specifying the efficient flow in rectangular ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Additionally, it was noted that the flow velocity in this type of duct was affected by increasing mesh size. This increase has contributed to the growth of the boundary layers of the smooth walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, the variance of mesh intensity played a considerable role in specifying the finest predictive value of heat flow in the triangular duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. Based on these outcomes achieved, the size, intensity, and quality of the mesh were powerful factors in picking the successful path of CFD prediction.</p><p>Based on the results of this short survey, there seems to be a strong connection between the type of ducts, the amount of flow, and the size of the mesh elements. These factors have a big effect on how well CFD can predict the heat transfer of airflow in non-circular ribbed ducts. Unfortunately, the previous study did not profoundly present a comparison study of this type of performance and proposed methods to enhance these kinds of ducts depending on the statistical analysis and the optimization techniques. Accordingly, the primary objective of the current work is to employ these parameters to determine the optimum prediction for heat flow in these ribbed ducts. Therefore, the present study used square, rectangular, and triangular tubes as a flow style. Besides, the flow levels in these ducts ranged from 1600–2000 for the Reynolds number, while the mesh sizes employed in the simulation were 6, 12, and 18 mm. Furthermore, the hybrid ribbed style was adopted in these ducts, where it was sequentially arranged as half-circular, triangular, and rectangular at a height of 30 mm for each rib. The best output from this stage of the SPO method helps test the viscosity model, the distribution of ribs, and the height levels of each rib to find out which of these ribbed ducts has the best thermal performance.</p><p>From the preceding, it is essential to comprehend the methodology of this study, which is organized into the style of airflow ducts, the description of the duct environment, mesh quality, and the SPO technique.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology of cfd simulation</title>
      <p>It turns out that the simulation operation by CFD has a considerable role in predicting the influential design of ribbed ducts, as aforementioned in the brief survey. To understand the laminar flow behavior in the rectangular, square, and triangular shapes of these tubes, the CFD method was used as a significant prediction environment. To find the best way to move heat in this case using a computer simulation system that is very accurate, the pattern of hybrid ribbed ducts (HRDs) has been planned for this study. So the commercial ANSYS software has been employed to implement the 3D modeling of HRDs and simulate these ducts. Hence, the hypotheses considered to achieve the present work were:</p><p>(1)The laminar flow mechanism embraces an untransient mode and incompressible flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>].</p><p>(2)Along the rectangular, square, and triangular ducts, the merits of fluid are regular. Hence, the air is employed in these ducts as a fluid domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, it can recognize the air properties at 300 K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p><p>(3)The condition of an interface between fluid and the structure of ducts is no-slip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p>

          <p>After going through the objectives of the current article, it is crucial to model the ribbed ducts as the first step of the planned methodology. Therefore, all tube models were ribbed as grooves to enhance thermal performance, where the ribs were designated, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, in a hybrid manner in these ducts to semi-circle, triangular, and rectangular grooves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, these tubes have been classified into square, rectangular, and triangular to investigate if the triangular ribbed ducts are best, besides comparing one of the close studies to validate the optimal case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>].</p>

          <p>The selection of one of the proposed ducts, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, is observably deemed the main path of this study. Hence, the numerical solution using FEA based on CFD principles is a basis for achieving this path.

              <p>According to the adopted hypotheses in the current work, it becomes clear that the flow of air in present HRDs varies based on Re numbers. Wherein these numbers contribute to variance in the inlet velocities at each type of duct, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>. These velocities result in the removal of heat from the heated surface, particularly in the rib-stimulated zone, where this zone increases the heat away from the laminar flow mechanism. As a result of this behavior, the walls of unribbed sides did not interact with this heat transfer state and behaved as adiabatic walls. On the other hand, the outlet zone is designed to be under atmospheric pressure. Thus, after describing the outlines of boundary conditions utilized in this study, it is vital to exhibit the data on these boundaries, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>.</p>

              <p>The continuity, momentum, and energy models are considered a well-trodden path for processing the domain toward the solution in the CFD technique. The researchers have followed this path in almost all HVAC applications to describe the fluids' dynamic and computation processes. From here, these models were employed under the steady state and laminar conditions in the ducts illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, depending on the hypotheses adopted in the present study. Hence, these models can be written as follows, based on the Cartesian coordinate system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]:</p><p>Continuity model:</p>

Besides the models describing viscosity, energy, and continuity as governing equations in the domain process of flow, it is vital to comprehend these models depending on CFD to obtain the final destination of the prediction of the optimal solution. Therefore, to reach this destination, it is significant to emphasize the strategies of the solution followed in CFD.</p>

              <p>As aforementioned, the steps of the pre-processor and processor have indicated the boundary conditions and the governing equations for energy, momentum, and continuity consecutively. Here, these steps paved the way for the strategies of solutions as a post-processor step in the numerical environment for the depicted ducts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, implemented by the segregated technique.</p><p>As is famous in the CFD field, this technique simultaneously treats the equations of velocity and pressure. Hence, the solution for the segregated path has been adopted here as one of the active and public algorithms known as the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. This algorithm contributes to solving the governing equations in the incompressible flow case. Moreover, this algorithm accurately employed the scheme upwind with a second order. Concerning spatial estimation, the method Green-Gauss Node Based for the gradient was adopted with this algorithm. On the other hand, the convergence criteria for the solutions of governing equations are designated at 10E-06 and 10E-03 for the energy equation and velocity components, respectively. The main reason this convergence limit was chosen for the speed parts is to keep the total shear stress from acting in a straight line at the boundary layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. The large mesh size also cuts down on the time it takes to find a solution by lowering the normalized residuals for the logarithm used in the finite volume analysis at 10E-03 for the velocity components. On the other hand, the Nusselt number suffers from an unstable solution for these components when the convergence limits range from 10E-4 to 10E-06 at $&lt;<inline-formula>

This means that the results of normalized residuals for the logarithm are stable at 10E-03 if, depending on the mesh size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>], the number of tangential velocity distributions in the flow is higher than the number of repetitions of tangential velocity at the duct. However, the convergence of energy criterion at 10E-06 can be used instead of 10E-03, as the laminar viscosity model cannot overcome the boundary layer at the entrance region. After that, the correct answer to the created unsteady governing differential equation for the energy criterion causes flow confusion at the ribbed section, which leads to the solution becoming less consistent. Accordingly, the temperature components of this governing equation at 10E-06 pretty much lessen this unstable convergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>].</p><p>According to this context, the steps of the numerical environment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> for the flow domain have been described, which is used in this study. However, it is necessary to highlight the divided elements of this environment besides the mesh efficiency based on the quality criteria followed at each ribbed duct.</p>

            <title>2.3. Mesh quality</title>
          
          <p>The FEM is one of the best numerical tools utilized in CFD solutions. On top of that, it was carefully aligned to the finite element volume (FEV) procedure path as a tool used in the ANSYS-FLUENT traditional program to manage the numerical environment and pick the mesh quality that works best [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>]. At this juncture, the skewness quality criterion is one of the best criteria to choose the best quality when the maximum value of this criterion approaches zero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">51</xref>]. Unfortunately, the previous studies were not meaningfully focused on obtaining the best mesh quality for the gridded airflow domain in ribbed ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>]. Consequently, the current work has employed a mesh size factor at each non-circular ribbed duct to specify the efficient quality. Moreover, the present work has utilized similar CFD cases that used mesh size in the flow ducts since there were a few studies that dealt with the role of the size of mesh elements in this field, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>:</p>

          <p>The mesh size data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref> makes it clear that the element size is smaller for short tubes and bigger for longer tubes. This allows for more flexibility in how the CPU unit handles the convergence time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, the tube length in the present work did not exceed 1 m. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the options in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref> to conclude that (2 mm $&lt;<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>\leq$ 20 mm) is more suitable for our tube length. The main reason for this choice is that the finer mesh is more logical for smaller tube sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">56</xref>]. On the other hand, the minimum mesh size limit adopted at over 3 m was 20 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>]. To choose the best quality of the gridded domain at each duct, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, elements with sizes ranging from 4 to 20 mm were tested to find the most important quality based on the skewness criterion. The tested elements in the square, triangular, and rectangular ribbed ducts have success at 6, 12, and 18 mm. Whereby it tended to reach toward the zeroth value, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>, depending on the maximum criterion of skewness. Additionally, it is observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> that the best mesh quality is concentrated at the coarse mesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. Still, these three values are essential to the planned optimized path to finally select the best-meshed domain in the last predictive solution.</p>

          <p>The significant parameters always nurture the optimization path to obtain the desired destinations as final responses. Hence, this trend contributed to enhancing the performance of ribbed ducts and boosting heat transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>]. Therefore, SPO is deemed one of the most popular and paramount optimization techniques used in diverse engineering areas, depending on the basic factorial optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>]. Hence, this optimization technique requires determining the influential parameters to predict the efficient performance of the HRD system adopted in the present work.</p><p>The range of effective values of Re numbers in the laminar flow has been found in the designated ducts shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> so that the planned comparison operation in this study can be carried out, as was already said. In addition, the mesh quality grades of the flow domain were described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> based on the comparison with the mesh size. Thus, it has become evident, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>, the scope adopted in the SPO technique to implement factorial path optimization. This scope was designed to accomplish the number of simulation runs needed to predict the optimum case. So, the PF is the last result of the SPO method. It shows how well the airflow system works thermally, based on how much the pressure drop at each ribbed duct grows. Hence, this factor at each simulation run can be calculated as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>]:</p>

Thus, the statistical analysis and SPO implementation are accomplished utilizing Minitab 18, which is traditional statistical software. Consequently, the value of this function for the PF in the single destination can be described as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">66</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>]:</p>

Therefore, the context of the current scenario adopted in this work has been scheduled to predict the optimum case of airflow in the HRD system first. Then, the second stage of this scenario is planned to investigate a studied case somewhat similar to this predictive case based on the viscous models and compare both cases based on rib style. This comparison aims to boost the PF of the optimum predictive case, depending on the distribution of ribs and the best viscous model. Finally, this case is improved by increasing the ribs' height to develop the PF of heat transfer for the optimum ribbed duct utilizing the SSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>]. The flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> briefly reveals the planned progression at each stage to execute the methodology of the present study.</p>

Therefore, it is essential to highlight the contribution of each phase in boosting the final style of the duct and the role of the hybrid rib style in improving the heat distribution operation.</p>

          <p>The dominant parameter in ANOVA and Pareto's chart in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, respectively, is mesh size. This parameter is deemed the first predominant factor in the numerical simulation of HRDs in the current work, where the P-value is zero, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>, and the F-value of this parameter is 7664.18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>]. Hence, the outcome of the F-value in ANOVA for mesh size was compliant with Pareto's chart of standardized effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>. Not only that, but this result fits with what we know about how the mesh resolution affects the flow in the ribbed duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>]. At the same time, both duct type and Reynolds number in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> were ranked second and third, respectively. According to this analysis, the duct type in the CFD simulation based on the hydraulic diameter of the cross-sectional duct illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> is also a significant parameter to enhance the skin friction in the flow duct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. The linear behavior demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> for Reynolds number was also slightly influential compared to mesh size and duct type. The main reason for this behavior is attributed to the change in the airflow mechanism and the turbulent flow in the test section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>]. Accordingly, the linear behavior role of these parameters based on ANOVA outcomes has been clarified. But it's important to know how the parameters that interact in ANOVA cause the regression model to behave in a way that isn't linear, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The F-value in the ANOVA shows that the mesh size and Reynolds number (A×B) were less important than the duct type (A×C) when looking at how they interacted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>. This outcome means the duct type plays a substantial role in the ribbed duct, depending on the shape of the hydraulic diameter, in enhancing the stability of the heat transition and balancing the pressure drop in the entrance region. Besides, the shear stress at the wall depends on the mesh density to specify this stable behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>]. However, the interaction of mesh size with Reynolds number, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>, refers to laminar flow being more stable at 1600 and 18 mm for Reynolds number and mesh size, respectively. So, the first result for SPO from ANOVA shows that the mesh size and Reynolds number tend to be the most accurate predictors without specifying the type of duct. In addition, the interaction between Reynolds number and duct type is not influential since the P-value in the ANOVA of the current work is higher than 5\% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">66</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>]. This interacted behavior is also inactive since the least hydraulic diameter employed reduces Reynolds number. This behavior helps to keep the laminar flow stable, especially in the smooth duct. However, this explanation doesn't work for the turbulent case in the test section because of the ribs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>].

          <p>Here, the regression behavior in Eq. (15) is the polynomial model for PF that gives us the fitted values compared to the predicted values for this response, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>. The model had correlation factors of over 99% for R-sq, R-sq(adj), and R-sq(pred), and the standard deviation was 0.0086447. Accordingly, the ANOVA for mesh size and Reynolds number in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> has presented an elementary outcome for the best predictive zone. Hence, the integrated configuration of the SPO technique as the final path can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>. The heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> shows the distribution of parameters utilized in the current work. Furthermore, it has highlighted the final optimal zone in maroon color at 18, 1600, and triangle duct for the mesh size, Reynolds number, and duct type, respectively. The results of the optimization plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>, on the other hand, match the results of this map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> at D = 0.9830, as shown in Eq. (14). Based on the SPO procedures, run 21 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref> is the best level, and run 7 is the worst level based on the PF's minimum output, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>, the temperature distribution in the optimal and worst cases is contrasting in configuration. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>, the temperature concentration after each rib is gradually regular compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. This problem is connected to the case of airflow deflection and the streamline velocity in the HRDs for the triangle and square shapes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>, in that order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_84">84</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> shows that the concentration of airflow deflection, along with the streamlined velocity, went up in a regular pattern after each rib. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> shows a hybrid ribbed square duct, but it didn't show this behavior. This is because the distribution of airflow deflection and the streamlined velocity wasn't balanced. This variance in the optimal and worst cases is attributed to the increased mesh resolution and Reynolds number in addition to the style of duct employed in this comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>].</p>

          <p>From these outcomes, the laminar flow at (Re = 1600) was a regular inflow at the entrance region of the triangular duct in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. In addition, the square-ribbed duct possesses the same stable behavior at Re = 2000, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. The main difference between these cases began in the test section, where the ribs changed the flow mechanism to turbulent flow and improved heat transfer, especially at the best run shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>. Thus, the role of Reynolds number was observably slightly or stagnant in the ANOVA of the SPO technique. Therefore, the importance of the Reynolds number in ANOVA depending on the P-value and F-value is considered an indicator to specify viscosity model expediency in the simulation. Thus, there has been a need to enhance this simulation by employing an active model for viscosity instead of the laminar model.</p>

            <title>3.2. Outcomes of investigation stage</title>
          
          <p>The triangular style of airflow duct induced by the SPO technique was one of the optimal predictive parameters. Therefore, it is essential to investigate one of the experimental studies that adopt this duct style. On the other hand, a comparison of the hybrid and identical ribs to verify the performance of turbulence flow is also needed. ANOVA results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> show that the laminar viscosity model did not work in the CFD simulation of the ribbed section, as shown by the small effect of Reynolds number on those results. Hence, it is significant to adopt the suitable viscosity model at this stage under the optimal outputs of the previous stage.</p><p>Mohammed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] presented one of these experimental studies that collected the triangular duct shape and the identical style of ribs. One of the cases in this study used Re = 1500 with three ribs adopted to investigate in this stage. The laminar viscosity model has not successfully validated the experimental Nusselt number, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>, where the error ratio approached 55.35%. This fact is attributed to the airflow over a ribbed surface breaking down the laminar boundary layer and becoming turbulent, causing increased friction and a more efficient transfer of heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>]. Therefore, a laminar viscosity model is unsuitable for accurately simulating fluid flow in ribbed ducts. The zone over 0.2 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref> is powerfully sensitive to the turbulent behavior with the models K-<inline-formula>
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

  </math>
</inline-formula>-Realizable. These models have achieved 8.83% and 14.16% error ratios, respectively. The deflection of airflow at each rib, according to K-<inline-formula>

    <mi>ε</mi>
  </math>
</inline-formula>-Standard in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_9">Figure 9</xref>, is more reasonable than the laminar model. Hence, this behavior conforms to the outputs of the ANOVA in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>, where it senses these outputs depending on the significance of the Reynolds number.

</inline-formula>-Standard model were divided into two groups: identical and hybrid styles for the distribution of ribs to find the best performance, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>. From here, the turbulence intensity of airflow after each rib in the hybrid ribs, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref>, is more concentrated than the identical ribs. Hence, the PF for the triangular duct at each style for the rib distribution is 2.0048 and 1.3221 for the hybrid and identical ribs, respectively. Accordingly, this outcome has confirmed the precedence of hybrid ribs compared to the other styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. On the other side, the value of this factor is divergent based on the viscosity models employed at the optimum level of hybrid rib style, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>.</p><p>The results of this stage showed a useful and important study of how the ribs and viscosity models are distributed in the triangle-shaped duct using the best case scenario of the SPO technique.

</inline-formula> and the hybrid style of ribs adopted in the current study have logically boosted the PF of this duct. However, the turbulence in the test section of hybrid ribs, besides the thermal performance, can be strongly enhanced by increasing the ribs' height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_87">87</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_88">88</xref>].</p>

This is in contrast to the same style. The SSP is deemed the best integration step for reliability to boost the optimal level of the SPO technique by improving the ribs' size for the triangular duct. So, this step includes finding the total chances of the ribs getting taller, reducing these chances using Central Composite Design (CCD), analyzing the results using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and finally making the design better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_89">89</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_91">91</xref>].</p>

          <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>, the steps of the SSP path were followed depending on the proposed heights over 30 mm to enhance the vortices at the test section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_93">93</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>].

As a final optimization, the final destination of SSP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref> shows that the best level of SPO was raised by making the rib height 66, 66, and 38.126 mm for semicircular, rectangular, and triangular ribs, respectively, instead of 30 mm for each rib. Because of this, it is clear that the turbulence intensity and PF values change at these increasing heights in the triangular duct, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref> for SSP and CFD.</p>

          <p>The way air flows through the triangular duct changes depending on the amount of turbulence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>. This is different for the hybrid ribs at 30 mm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref> compared to the traditional hybrid ribs at the same height. Hence, the predicted result from CFD simulation is different from the outcome of SSP, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref>. Hereby, the error ratio between these outcomes for the final optimal responses of PF and turbulence intensity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref> was 1.233% and 0.554%, respectively. Besides, these outcomes achieved in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref> are indicators of enhancement in the thermal performance depending on the path of SSP depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_11">Figure 11</xref>. So, the turbulence intensity at 30 mm for each rib at the best level of the SPO was 0.042318, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_12">Figure 12</xref>, this value has grown to 0.104431 when the SSP path is used. These outputs refer to an increase in the turbulence intensity up to 146.77%, depending on this enhancement. Accordingly, this enhancement has increased the PF to 4.90%. Hence, the optimal predictive path of SSP has boosted this factor for the triangular duct at the optimum level of the SPO technique.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The enhancement of heat performance in the airflow ducts has constituted an obsession for researchers in this field. Therefore, numerous predictive paths have been explored to enhance this factor. Consequently, this study presented a deep scenario to adopt the best outcome of the PF by employing the mesh size, duct style, and laminar range of the Reynolds number at 1600–2000. Besides, it utilized a hybrid distribution of ribs inside square, rectangular, and triangular ducts. Thus, this study has concluded the following:</p><p>(1) At 18, 1600, and triangular duct for mesh size and Reynolds number beside duct style, respectively, represented the optimal outcomes according to the SPO. This optimal level produced the best PF and was equal to 1.7184 at 99.96% and 0.9830 for the correlation factor and desirability function sequentially.</p><p>(2) The ANOVA was a successful indicator to sense the illogical behavior of the laminar model of viscosity in the test section, where the model of K-<inline-formula>
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>ε</mi>
  </math>
</inline-formula>-Standard achieved the best investigation compared to other models, including the laminar model.</p><p>(3) At the optimal level based on the SPO technique, the hybrid rib distribution was better than the identical style of ribs in the triangular duct. Accordingly, the value of PF with the hybrid rib style was 2.0048 as compared to the performance of the identical distribution.</p><p>(4) The predictive PF according to the SSP path was boosted to 2.077409 since the improved ribs' heights were over 30 mm at 66, 66, and 38.126 mm for semi-circle, rectangular, and triangular ribs at the optimal level resulting from the SPO technique. On the other hand, the predictive simulation utilizing CFD has produced 2.103044 for this factor. Therefore, the error ratio of the PF between SSP and CFD was 1.233%. From this point on, this error ratio shows how the SSP path raises the SPO outputs by using these ribs' heights for the triangle hollow tube. Thus, the performance of this enhanced ribbed duct has increased to 4.90%, and this increase led to the growth of turbulence intensity to 146.77%.</p><p>The results derived from this investigation underscore the significant enhancement in heat performance achieved in a triangular HRD when employing SPO and SSP techniques. The pivotal contribution of this study lies in the optimized enhancement of laminar flow heat performance through these methodologies. It has been demonstrated that effective stimulation of flow simulation predictions can be realized by adopting these optimization approaches.</p><p>Furthermore, the implications of these findings extend beyond the immediate scope of this study. The methodologies and results herein present a promising potential for application in solar technologies, particularly in the solar air heater (SAH) system. The adaptability and effectiveness of the optimized laminar flow in such applications offer fertile ground for future research.</p><p>This study's emphasis on optimization methods for flow simulation in triangular HRDs aligns with the current needs for enhancing energy efficiency in solar technologies. The research methodologies employed and the results obtained contribute significantly to the field, offering a foundation for further explorations and practical applications in energy-efficient designs.</p><p>In summary, the study provides a comprehensive approach to optimizing laminar flow in non-circular ducts, with a particular focus on triangular HRDs. The integration of SPO and SSP techniques has proven to be effective, paving the way for their application in solar energy systems, such as the SAH system. Future investigations could expand upon these findings, exploring the broader applicability and potential modifications to enhance the performance and efficiency of such systems.</p>
