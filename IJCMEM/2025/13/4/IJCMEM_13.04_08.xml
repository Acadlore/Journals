      <abstract><p>This article presents a mathematical analysis of 3D Williamson nanofluid flow over a stretching Riga plate in a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium. The model incorporates thermal radiation, heat generation/absorption, and the Buongiorno nanofluid framework with Cattaneo-Christov double flux. Similarity transformations reduce the governing PDEs to ODEs, solved using Mathematica's NDSolve. Graphs and tables illustrate the effects of key parameters on velocity, temperature, concentration, skin friction, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. The x-direction velocity increases with the modified Hartmann number ($Ha$ = 0.5–2.0), enhancing skin friction by 20–30%. Higher thermophoresis ($Nt$ = 0.1–0.5) elevates temperature and concentration by 15–20% and 10–14%, respectively. Brownian motion ($Nb$ = 0.1–0.5) boosts mass transfer, increasing Sherwood number by 7–9%. Increasing heat and mass relaxation parameters ($\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$ = 0.1–0.5) accelerates Nusselt and Sherwood numbers by 5–10%. Results correlate well with prior studies, providing a basis for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) cooling systems, polymer processing, and biomedical simulations involving non-Newtonian fluids.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Non-Newtonian fluids are liquids that do not exhibit a direct linear relationship between shear stress and shear rate, unlike Newtonian fluids. This distinctive behaviour makes them fundamentally different from Newtonian fluids such as air and water, whose viscosity remains constant under given conditions. Non-Newtonian fluids display a wide range of complex flow characteristics and are classified based on their response to shear stress or shear rate, including shear-thinning, Bingham plastic, shear-thickening, thixotropic, viscoelastic, and rheopectic fluids. Determining their rheological properties is essential in several industries and applications, such as drilling operations, materials research, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food processing. Traditional Navier-Stokes relations often fail to capture the complex behaviour of these fluids. Consequently, various mathematical models have been developed to describe their thermophysical and rheological characteristics, including the Carreau model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], Maxwell fluid model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], Cross model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], Tiwari-Das model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], Casson fluid model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], Williamson model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], among others. Sarda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] investigated heat and mass transfer in a non-Newtonian nanofluid through porous media considering thermophoresis and Brownian motion. Kumar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] carried out a computational study of 2D fluid flow with heat and mass transfer in the natural convection of a micropolar fluid subjected to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects over a deformable, porous, stretched surface. Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] examined the influence of slip boundary conditions, modified Fourier and Fick laws, and Joule heating on the flow of a second-order fluid. Numerous researchers have explored the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids over stretching surfaces, as discussed in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>Nanofluids represent an advanced approach to heat transfer, consisting of a conventional base fluid into which nanoparticles are dispersed. They have been widely used in enzyme biosensors, microreactors, bio-separation systems, micro heat pipes, microchannel heat sinks, and various other devices. Over the past two decades, two-component nanofluid flows have attracted significant research attention because of their enhanced heat transfer capabilities. In many engineering and industrial applications, effective thermal management—reincluding cooling, heating, thermal efficiency, and energy savings-is of critical importance. Common base fluids such as hydrocarbons, water, ethylene glycol, oil, and mercury contribute substantially to these thermal processes. The addition of nanoparticles (1–100 nm) to a conventional fluid increases its thermal conductivity, forming what are known as nanofluids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Building on these developments, Buongiorno [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] proposed a comprehensive mathematical model that incorporates thermophoresis and Brownian motion effects. Water, due to its accessibility and favourable properties, is frequently used as a solvent in industrial operations. Gireesha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] examined the influence of thermal stratification on boundary-layer flow over an expanding sheet. Salleh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], using the Buongiorno nanofluid framework, theoretically investigated the roles of heat generation/absorption and chemical reactions in laminar boundary-layer nanofluid flow. Walelign et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] analysed the influence of heat generation and chemical reactions on unsteady MHD radiative flow of a Williamson nanofluid over a permeable stretching surface. Waqas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] studied the impact of temperature and MHD effects on nanofluid flow in parallel-plate rotating systems. Sumathi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] explored the effects of key parameters on MHD nanofluid flow over an inclined stretching sheet. Numerous other researchers have also contributed significantly to nanofluid studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>].</p><p>Most significant fluid flows in chemical, manufacturing, biological, and industrial processes occur in the presence of porous or permeable media. Examples include petroleum purification, water penetration in storage tanks, material filtration, and even blood circulation. To study such systems effectively, it is important to investigate Darcy-Forchheimer fluid flow. While Darcy’s law provides a foundational description of flow through porous media, its applicability becomes limited at higher velocities. In many practical situations, especially when the porous region has low porosity or when the flow rate near the wall is high, Darcy’s linear relationship fails to describe the flow accurately. The Darcy-Forchheimer model incorporates both viscous and inertial effects, offering a more realistic representation of fluid velocity and heat transfer through porous structures. Considering exponential stretching, Ahmad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] examined a 3D couple-stress MHD nanofluid flow using the Darcy-Forchheimer model and reported that fluid acceleration increases with a rise in the inertia parameter. Awais et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>] investigated the influence of a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium on the flow, temperature, and mass transfer characteristics of a 2D Eyring-Powell fluid. Influence of inertia “Forchheimer term” and macroscopic shear “Brinkman term” are pointedly considered by Elkady et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. Zolotukhin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] focused on focus of this article is on accounting for non-Darcy flow when inertial forces become more significant and the relationship between pressure gradient and seepage velocity becomes nonlinear.</p><p>A 3D flow model is a vital component of fluid flow analysis because it captures the full flow behavior observed in real-life applications, where variations occur in all three spatial directions. Unlike 1D or 2D analyses, a 3D analysis can represent detailed spatial gradients in velocity, pressure, and temperature, as well as important features such as secondary flows and certain turbulence effects that lower-dimensional models cannot capture. This level of detail is essential for making reliable predictions and guiding design improvements in fields such as aerodynamics (e.g., aircraft wing design), hydrodynamics (e.g., ship hull performance), and various engineering systems including turbines, motors, and heat exchangers. A 3D model provides more accurate estimates of forces, drag, lift, heat transfer, and energy losses, ultimately contributing to safer, more efficient, and cost-effective designs across aerospace, mechanical, and energy applications. Abdul Hakeem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>] analyzed the effect of nonlinear radiation on nanofluid flow, Akolade and Tijani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] compared two non-Newtonian nanofluids flowing over a Riga plate, and Jusoh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>] reported the characteristics of 3D nanofluid flow over a permeable sheet.</p><p>An electromagnetic actuator that consists of the aggregation of adjusted magnets along with the spanwise arranged layout of electrodes with alternation mounting on a flat surface is indicated as a Riga plate. This actuator is responsible for the generation of exponentially decreasing Lorentz force within the boundary layer. Khatun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>] performed on the numerical investigation of electro-magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) radiating fluid flow nature along an infinitely long vertical Riga plate with suction in a rotating system. Reddy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>] and Zaydan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>] and focused on this subject.</p><p>The precise manipulation of heat conduction remains an intricate and pressing challenge. Historically, the classical Fourier’s law, grounded in experimental evidence, has been the prevailing model delineating the heat conduction process. However, a crucial limitation of Fourier’s law is its assumption of infinite heat conduction velocity, rendering it unsuitable for numerous applications. To bridge this gap, scholars have presented various extended models to portray heat conduction, notably Abro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], Benenti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], and Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>].</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, previous studies examined MHD, porous media, or Cattaneo-Christov flux separately (or in pairs) for various non-Newtonian models. However, the simultaneous coupling of (a) Williamson type shear-thinning rheology, (b) Cattaneo-Christov thermal and mass relaxation (non-Fourier effects), (c) Darcy-Forchheimer porous inertia, and (d) Riga surface electromagnetic forcing leads to non-trivial interactions: relaxation terms modify near-wall temperature and nanoparticle boundary layers (thus changing the effective Nusselt and Sherwood numbers), while porous inertial terms alter momentum redistribution that interacts with Lorentz forcing from the Riga plate. These cross-effects have not been catalogued collectively for a 3D flow; doing so elucidates parameter regimes where MHD actuation can be used to compensate for porous or rheological losses-a practical design insight for microfluidic cooling and magnetically assisted drug delivery. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> shows the innovation of the existing study.</p>

      <p>The coupled model developed in this study offers clear engineering value and practical applicability. It provides design guidance for MHD-assisted cooling and micro-scale heat exchangers by showing how magnetic/Riga actuation can enhance surface heat removal even in porous or shear-thinning fluids. It also helps optimize microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems, where the interaction between Darcy-Forchheimer drag and Lorentz forcing identifies conditions that restore flow rates and maintain required thermal gradients. In biomedical applications, the combined effects of Cattaneo-Christov relaxation and Buongiorno nanoparticle transport improve predictions of nanoparticle distribution and heating, which is important for magnetic hyperthermia and drug-delivery processes. Overall, the novelty of this work lies in integrating multiple advanced physical mechanisms within a 3D framework and translating their combined influence into practical, quantitative design guidelines for engineers working with MHD cooling devices, porous microreactors, and magnetically controlled biomedical flows.</p><p>The key objectives of this study are as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>3. Methodology for solution</title>
      <p>This research examines the 3D Williamson nanofluid flow along a Riga plate in a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium. This study utilizes the Cattaneo-Christov double-diffusion model to describe non-Fourier transport in heat and nanoparticle diffusion processes. This study also implements Buongiorno's model, which considers the impacts of Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The NDSolve function in Mathematica performs numerical evaluations of the various parameters. To confirm the precision of the adopted scheme’s, the latest outcomes of the adopted were compared with those of Loganathan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>], Ragupathi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>], and Umar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>] in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>. The flowchart of this approach is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

</inline-formula>\phi$, enhanced convection thins the boundary layers, causing faster diminishing of ambient values. The velocity distribution increases by approximately 20–30% with a rise in the Hartmann number owing to the Lorentz force, while the corresponding temperature and concentration profiles decrease by about 10–12% an 8–10%, respectively. Electromagnetic forcing alters primary and secondary velocities differently because the Riga plate generates a Lorentz force primarily in the x-direction, accelerating axial flow while redistributing momentum to suppress cross-flow in the y-direction due to induced drag.</p>

</inline-formula>, while making the momentum boundary layer thinner. The acceleration in Fr represents the inertial drag in the porous medium, which restricts fluid movement by adding extra resistance to the flow. The combination of porous drag and inertial resistance creates a significant velocity reduction close to the Riga plate, which shows that permeability control and inertial losses play essential roles in controlling the transport processes in non-Newtonian nanofluid systems. Physically, Darcy resistance dissipates momentum through viscous drag, while Forchheimer resistance introduces inertial losses; together, they weaken fluid motion and redistribute momentum within the boundary layer.</p>

</inline-formula>\approx$10–12%) but increases local Sherwood number by 7–9%. Thermophoresis and Brownian diffusion play a crucial role in governing nanoparticle transport in the vicinity of the wall. Brownian diffusion promotes random motion of nanoparticles, enhancing particle mixing and increasing thermal energy transport near the surface. As a result, higher Brownian motion intensifies the heat transfer rate and elevates the local Nusselt number. Conversely, thermophoresis induces a migration of nanoparticles from the hot wall toward cooler regions, which reduces the near-wall nanoparticle concentration and weakens the mass transfer rate, leading to a decrease in the Sherwood number. The interplay between these two mechanisms controls the thickness of the thermal and concentration boundary layers and significantly influences near-wall heat and mass transfer characteristics.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The combined effects of Williamson rheology, electromagnetic forcing, porous-medium inertia, and non-Fourier fluxes are expected in engineering contexts such as MHD-assisted cooling in electronics (where <inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> = 0.5–2.0 enhances heat removal by 8–12%), polymer extrusion processes involving shear-thinning fluids, and biomedical transport like magnetic drug delivery in porous tissues. Parameters with the strongest design implications include the modified Hartmann number (Ha, boosting skin friction by 20–30%) and thermophoresis (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mrff5m7gmg">
    <mml:mi>N</mml:mi>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>, altering concentration by 10–14%). The present results inform optimization of cooling devices by using Riga plates to counteract porous drag, microfluidic platforms through porosity control for flow rate stability, and biomedical systems by predicting nanoparticle distribution for targeted hyperthermia or tissue engineering. The present study analyzed the 3D Williamson nanofluid flow over a stretching Riga plate embedded in a Darcy-Forchheimer porous medium, incorporating the Cattaneo-Christov heat and mass flux models along with the effects of Brownian motion, thermophoresis, and other relevant parameters. The key findings are:</p><p>• The Williamson parameter increases the effective viscosity, leading to a reduction in velocities in both orientations, while the temperature and concentration profiles rise owing to reduced convective transport and stronger diffusion.</p><p>• The modified Hartmann number enhances electromagnetic forcing, which accelerates the primary velocity but reduces the secondary velocity, temperature, and concentration distributions.</p><p>• The porous parameter and Forchheimer number act as momentum sinks, decreasing the velocities in both directions.</p><p>• The radiation parameter increases the temperature for a positive Biot number (convective heating) but decreases the temperature for a negative Biot number (convective cooling).</p><p>• The Lewis number and mass thermal relaxation time parameter reduce the concentration profiles by weakening mass diffusion within the boundary layer.</p><p>• The thermophoresis factor amplifies both <inline-formula>

  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>.</p><p>• The skin friction coefficient in x direction typically rises with stronger electromagnetic effects.</p><p>• Applying models such as Cattaneo-Christov for heat and mass flux in Williamson nanofluid flow leads to reduced thermal and concentration layer thicknesses with higher relaxation parameters, thereby improving control over heat and mass transfer rates.</p><p>• Future Directions: Further studies are recommended to explore variable viscosity, complex geometries, or hybrid nanofluid formulations to optimize the Williamson nanofluid performance in advanced engineering applications.</p>
