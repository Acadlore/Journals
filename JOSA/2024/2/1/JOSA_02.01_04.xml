      <abstract>In the realm of general insurance in India, an econometric investigation was conducted to estimate the revenue efficiency across a selection of 15 prominent, diversified general insurance entities for the fiscal years 2011-12 to 2016-17. Utilizing a semi-parametric methodology, the revenue frontier was constructed under the GAM framework, while the variance components were estimated employing the method of moments. This analysis further explored the influence of revenue efficiency on critical profitability metrics, namely return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), through the application of instrumental variable regression. The findings provide pivotal insights into the dynamics of revenue efficiency and its consequential impact on the financial performance of general insurance companies in India, offering a substantial contribution to the literature on insurance economics and the methodology of efficiency measurement. The research underscores the significance of adopting semi-parametric models for a nuanced understanding of revenue efficiency, thus paving the way for enhanced strategic decision-making in the insurance sector.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The general insurance industry plays a crucial protective role in any modern society as it compensates for losses in property, liability and health of the insured. General insurance includes all forms of insurance except life insurance. The principal forms of general insurance include: (i) insurance of property (against incidence of theft, burglary or fire); (ii) insurance of health (against physical illness); and (iii) insurance against liability (professional, product and public liabilities).</p><p>In the context of Indian insurance market, the segment of general insurance compared to the total insurance market is relatively miniscule; general insurance accounts for around 22% of the total insurance market in India. However, the industry has tremendous potential for expansion in view of the growing need to protect properties and agricultural produce from natural calamities (or incidents like a fire breakout), protect businesses and individuals against contingent liabilities and provide a cushion against rising health care costs.</p><p>In the post-reform phase, the efficiency and productivity performance of the general insurance companies have been evaluated by several studies using aDEA (non-parametric) framework and most of them attempted to evaluate the economic/technical efficiency of the general insurers. The present study, in contrast, adopted a different approach. In the first phase, a revenue frontier of the in-sample general insurers has been constructed utilising a semi-parametric General Additive Model-Stochastic Frontier Analysis (GAM-SFA) approach wherein the frontier is estimated by applying the GAM and the variance parameters are obtained by using pseudo-likelihood estimators. In the second stage, the relationship between important profitability parameters and revenue efficiency estimates is explored in terms of regression with an instrumental variable. The study has five sections and proceeds as follows: Section 1 provides a brief overview of the Indian general insurance industry. Section 2 reviews the extant literature on general insurance performance. Section 3 outlines the methodology. Section 4 relates to the data, results and discussion. Section 5 is the conclusion.</p>

      <title>2. General insurance industry in india</title>
      <p>The origin of the general industry sector in India is quite old. The contemporary form of general insurance industry originated in India much before independence. Thus, Triton Insurance Co. Ltd. Came in to existence in 1850. This was succeeded by the formation of the Bombay Mutual Life Insurance Society (in 1870) and the Oriental Assurance Company (in 1880). Thereafter, numerous non-life insurance companies were established in India. Consequently, more than 100 non-life insurance companies existed in India at the juncture of the nationalization (1973) when the industry came under government control. The process of government take over (of the industry) involved the formation of the General Insurance Corporation as the government-sponsored reinsurance entity and the establishment of (four) government-sponsored general insurance companies (by merging 107 non-government non-life insurers).</p><p>In the 1990s, India embraced an open market economy with a greater role for the private sector. Financial sector reform was an integral part of the reform process which was initiated with banking sector reform involving the deregulation of private sector entry and the introduction of prudential regulations for banking operations. At the same time, the Government of India set up a high-powered committee on the Indian insurance sector (headed by Shri R. N. Malhotra) to examine the existing scenario and recommend appropriate measures for boosting competitive efficiency and strengthening the regulatory framework. The Committee recommended deregulation in both the life and general insurance markets. Private sector players started entering the general insurance market in 2000 and by March 2017, the total number of general insurance companies had increased to 31. During the post-liberalisation phase, the sector witnessed significant growth in terms of premium growth, asset management and the branch network of the insurance companies. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> provides a brief overview of the growth observed in the sector between end-March 2012 and end-March 2017. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> provides the movements in insurance penetration (ratio of aggregate insurance premium to GDP), insurance density (ratio of insurance premium to total population) and incurred claims ratio (ratio of total paid claims to total premium collected) during the same period.</p>

          <p>Toivanen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] estimated the economies of scale and scope for the Finnish non-life insurance industry for the period 1989-91. The study identified two types of costs (operating costs and costs arising from incurred claims) related to production and portfolio management functions. The study emphasized on the formation of a branch network for gaining market power or information acquisition benefits since it helps captivate customers from the standpoint of portfolio management. The study established the existence of scale diseconomies among the firms, scale economies at the branch level and scope economies in production. Fukuyama and Weber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] estimated the efficiency and productivity growth of Japanese non-life insurance companies for the period 1983-1994. They estimated output-oriented technical efficiency and the Malmquist index of total factor productivity change. <span>The productivity change estimate was further decomposed into efficiency change and frontier shift components.</span> The study found significant productivity improvement during 1983-90 which was <span>primarily contributed by technical change</span>. In the <span>succeeding</span> three years, technical change stagnated (due to the collapse of the bubble economy) but started improving again by 1993-94.</p><p>Ennsfellner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] examined the production efficiency of the Austrian insurance market for the time period 1994-1999. The study used a Bayesian stochastic frontier for estimating the aggregate and firm-specific efficiency of the in-sample insurance companies. The study found that the process of deregulation of the Austrian insurance market had influenced the productive efficiency of the insurers in a positive manner.</p><p>Choi and Weiss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] examined the performance of the US property-liability industry using a stochastic frontier approach.In particular, the study examined the linkage between firm performance, market structure and efficiency in property-liability insurers during 1992–1998.The study estimated both cost and revenue efficiency and examined the soundness of three following hypotheses: traditional SCP(Structure-Conduct-Performance),RMP( the Relative Market Power), and ES (Efficient Structure). The results obtained from the aforementioned study provided support for the efficient structure hypothesis. According to the efficient structure hypothesis, more efficient firms are able to charge lower prices than competitors. This permits them to get larger market shares and extract economic rents, resulting in increased concentration in the industry. Thus, as per the study, insurance regulators should be more concerned about efficiency compared to relative market power.</p><p>Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] applied a two-stage non-parametric model for evaluating the efficiency of the Canadian life and health insurance industry. His study includes two separate models for the computation of production and investment efficiency for both input- and output-oriented models. In the second stage of the study, a dummy input with value 1 was used and the production and (inverse of) investment efficiency scores were used as outputs. This model thus involved the integration of production and investment performance for the observed insurance companies. The evidence obtained from the study indicated that the life and health insurance industry in Canada operated fairly efficiently during the in-sample period.</p><p>Kao and Hwang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] applied a relational and independent two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model to evaluate the performance of 24 non-life insurance companies in Taiwan using average data for 2001 and 2002. The study decomposed the activity of insurance firms into two sub-processes: marketing (intermediate stage) and investment (final stage). The study showed that efficiency in the investment sub-process was lower than in the first-stage activity (marketing). Cummins and Xie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] studied the effects of mergers and acquisitions in the US property-liability insurance industry on the productivity and efficiency of the insurers using data from 1994–2003. The results suggested that mergers and acquisitions in property-liability insurance increased the valuation of the concerned insurers. Their study found that acquiring insurers achieved more revenue efficiency gains than non-acquiring companies, and target firms exhibited greater cost and allocative efficiency growth as compared to the companies which were not targeted.</p><p>Barros et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] used two-stage conditional performance benchmarking for the efficiency evaluation of 71 Greek life and non-life insurance companies. The study assumed that the returns to scale were global for 1994 to 2003. The first-phase outcomes of the study revealed significant divergence in efficiency performance for the in-sample time span. The second-phase (regression) results indicate that while extent of competition is a major influential variable of efficiency in the Greek insurance industry, this was not enough to accelerate market efficiency for the observed period. Mahlberg and Url [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] examined the efficiency and productivity impact of market unification on the German insurance companies for the period 1991-2006. Their study estimated the technical, revenue, cost efficiency and total factor productivity of 202 insurance companies under non-increasing returns to scale. The study provided a mixed picture regarding the convergence of performance among the observed insurance companies.</p><p>Cummins and Xie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] examined efficiency, productivity and scale economies in the US property-liability insurance industry. The study analysed efficiency and change in total factor productivity using DEA. The results showed that most of the insurers below median size in the industry exhibited IRS (increasing returns to scale), and the majority of the property-liability insurers above median size exhibited DRS (decreasing returns to scale). Jarraya and Bouri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] investigated profit efficiency and optimal production targets for the European non-life insurance industry for the period 2002-2008.They used the directional distance function for the computation of profit efficiency and the Lagrangean function for the specification of an optimal production plan. The study estimated the parameters of a stochastic technology frontier constructed from a sample of 175 non-life insurance companies. On the basis of the optimal quantity of inputs, good outputs and bad outputs generated from their model, the study proposed indices of inefficiency for profit and production factors.</p><p>Alhassan and Biekpe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] estimated the efficiency, productivity and returns to scale of South African non-life insurance companies for the period 2007-2012. They employed DEA for estimating efficiency, returns to scale and Malmquist total factor productivity change for the aforementioned period. They applied truncated bootstrapped and logistic regression techniques for identifying the determinants of efficiency and the probability of operating under constant returns to scale. The results showed that non-life insurers operated with about 50 percent efficiency. Approximately 20 percent of insurers were scale-efficient. The study also found productivity improvements during the period which were mainly due to technological changes. The results of the regression analysis indicated a non-linear impact of size on efficiency and constant returns to scale. Variables like product line diversification, reinsurance and leverage also had a significant relationship with efficiency and constant returns to scale.</p><p>Ferro and Leon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] applied SFA to estimate the technical efficiency of Argentine non-life insurance companies for the period 2009-2014. The study applied two models: a time-invariant inefficiency model and time-varying decay model. The results indicated a low average of technical efficiency, a stagnated efficiency level during the later phase of the observed time period and a negative technical change.</p>

          <p>Mandal and Ghosh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] estimated the technical efficiency of 12 general insurance companies in India for the period 2006-07 to 2009-10 using DEA. The study sought to assess the impact of the global economic slowdown on the general insurance sector. Sinha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] used a dynamic DEA framework for estimating the dynamic efficiency performance of Indian general insurance companies. In a second study, Sinha [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] estimated the efficiency of Indian general insurance companies for 2013-14 using the conditional performance benchmarking method. Ilyas and Rajasekharan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] estimated the efficiency, total factor productivity and returns to scale of the Indian non-life insurance industry over the period 2005-2016. The first study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] found that the Indian non-life insurance industry was moderately technical, scaled, cost-effective, and allocatively efficient. The second study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] found (using the Fare-Primont index) that the non-life insurance sector exhibited a very low level of total factor productivity. The total factor productivity growth observed during the observed period (2005-2016) is mainly attributable to scale-mix efficiency.</p><p>The present study takes a different approach in the estimation of the efficiency performance of the in-sample general insurance companies in two respects. First, it seeks to estimate the revenue efficiency of the observed general insurers which has not been attempted so far in the existing literature. Second, the current study adopts a relatively novel approach to the estimation of efficiency.</p>

            <title>4.1. Frontier production function and estimation methodology</title>
          
          <p>Neoclassical economics defines a production function as one which relates the maximum producible level of output to a fixed bundle of inputs. Thus, for practical purposes, one can think of an industry production function which implies a frontier of potential output corresponding to the given input level while individual production functions may vary from the frontier because of variations in the scale of operation or heterogeneity in organizational structure. However, in the conventional econometric approach, the average production function was estimated as the representative of the industry production function. Farrell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] defined the technical efficiency of an industry with respect to a given efficient isoquant as the weighted average of the technical efficiency of the corresponding isoquants of the constituent firms. A major weakness of this average approach is that the performance of a firm is compared with the average performance and not the best practice firm. Initial efforts were made by Aigner and Chu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] using linear and quadratic programming with single equations and two-stage least squares techniques.

          <p>An important part of the present study is to explore how the measures of revenue efficiency explain the profitability indicators of the in-sample general insurance companies. For this, an appropriate regression model has to be formulated with efficiency measured as the explanatory variable. However, revenue efficiency cannot be estimated directly. The estimate obtained depends significantly on the methodology being used. Further, the efficiency variable is stochastic in nature. In such cases, the instrumental variable method can be used, with the explanatory variable semi-replaced by another variable, which is correlated with the explanatory variable instead of the error term.</p><p>To explain the instrumental variable method in brief, the following regression model is considered:</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

            <title>5.1. Description of variables</title>
          
          <p>Estimation of revenue frontiers and revenue efficiency requires the selection of input indicators, output indicators and (input and output) prices. However, specification of input and output variables (and price parameters) in the context of a general insurance industry is a difficult task because of the complexities involved in defining the indicator variables.</p><p>Eling and Luhnen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] identified three major types of inputs used in the insurance industry: labour (including agents and office staff), business services (including items such as travel, communications and advertisement) and capital (including debt and equity capital). On the output side, Leverty and Grace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] found three alternative approaches for choosing outputs: the Financial Intermediation (FI) approach, the User Cost (UC) approach and the Value Added (VA) approach. In the context of commercial banking and other financial service providers engaged in fund-mobilisation and allocative activities, this intermediation view considers financial service units as intermediation firms who bridge the gap between demanders and suppliers of funds. The value-added approach considers those activities as outputs which contribute significant value as assessed using operating cost allocations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. Broadly speaking, the value-added approach assumes that the insurers provide three major services: risk-pooling and risk-bearing, real financial services and financial intermediation. Some studies have used net premiums as valued added while others have used incurred benefits and changes in reserves as output proxies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p><p>The present study seeks to construct a revenue frontier. Therefore, the major activities need to be identified, which contribute to insurer revenue as well as the inputs of service production. The problem in the Indian context, however, is the absence of very detailed information about variables which may be used as inputs and outputs for the estimation of revenue frontiers and revenue efficiency. Since very detailed information on various inputs cannot be obtained separately, two inputs are considered: total operating expenses and assets under management. The first input is considered as the proxy input for capturing operational activities which are required to generate premium. The second input captures the investment activities of general insurance companies. On the output side, net premium income and income from investments are considered as the two outputs. <span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">For </span><span>all the output indicators, the corresponding prices are considered</span> as unity<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">. </span><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> presents a brief statement of input indicators, output indicators and prices.</p>

Thus, mean efficiency scores declined between 2011-12 and 2012-13, improved in the next financial year (2013-14) and declined for the next two years (2014-15 and 2015-16), In the last year under observation, mean scores improved somewhat in the first model while continuing the declining trend in the second model.

The principal purpose of CV is to judge the ability of the selected model to correctly predict new response data points which was not utilised in the regression process. The CV procedure incorporates segmenting the available data into two complementary (mutually exclusive) subsets: in-sample which is used for carrying out the regression analysis and the second which is utilised for testing the model. Repeated CV is normally done in order to decrease heterogeneity in test results. In the present study, the GCV (Generalised Cross-Validation) score of the fitted GAM is computed. Lower values of GCV imply better reproducibility of the data.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> exhibits the results of the two models used in the present study.

              <p>A part of this research enquiry is to explore the relationship of profitability measures (ROE and ROA) with revenue efficiency. However, owing to the existence of omitted variables, the application of ordinary least squares cannot be fruitful as the efficiency variable is correlated with the error term of the model. Therefore, the instrumental variable method of regression is applied. The solvency ratio is used as the instrumental variable, which has a very low correlation with the dependent variables (ROE and ROA) but is highly correlated with the explanatory variable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_13">Table 13</xref> present the instrument variable regression outcomes for the two models.
