      <abstract><p>The integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into modern power grids presents both challenges and opportunities. This study investigates the influence of slack bus compensation on the stability of voltage levels within these grids, particularly as EV penetration increases. A comprehensive simulation framework is developed to model various grid configurations, accounting for different scenarios of EV load integration. Historical charging data is meticulously analysed to predict future load patterns, indicating that heightened levels of EV integration lead to a notable decrease in voltage stability. Specifically, voltage levels were observed to decline from 230 V to 210 V under conditions of 100% EV penetration, necessitating an increase in slack bus compensation from 0 MW to 140 MW to sustain system balance. Advanced machine learning techniques are employed to forecast real-time load demands, significantly reducing both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), thereby optimising slack bus performance. The results underscore the critical role of real-time load forecasting and automated control strategies in addressing the challenges posed by EV integration into power grids. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that intelligent systems, coupled with machine learning, can enhance power flow management and bolster grid stability, ultimately improving operational efficiency in the distribution of energy. Future research will focus on refining machine learning models through the utilisation of more granular data sets and exploring decentralized control methodologies, such as federated learning, thereby providing valuable insights for grid operators as the adoption of EVs continues to expand.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The increasing penetration of EVs into modern power grids introduces significant logistical and operational challenges. One critical factor affecting grid performance is the slack bus, which maintains voltage stability and power balance. As EV adoption rises, managing these dynamic loads becomes increasingly complex, requiring advanced solutions for real-time optimization. This study investigates the impact of slack bus performance on EV integration, leveraging machine learning techniques to improve grid stability and operational efficiency. By developing intelligent systems for power flow optimization and load forecasting, this research aims to enhance logistical operations and ensure the seamless integration of EVs into power grids. These insights provide valuable strategies for grid operators to maintain system reliability as EV adoption accelerates.</p><p>The increasing adoption of EVs is transforming the landscape of transportation and energy consumption. As governments and individuals push for more sustainable energy practices, the proliferation of EVs presents both opportunities and challenges for power grid integration. This transition necessitates a reevaluation of existing electrical infrastructures to accommodate the substantial demand for charging while maintaining grid stability and reliability. EVs operate as mobile energy storage units, providing the potential for grid flexibility and demand-side management. However, their integration into the power grid can lead to increased peak loads, voltage fluctuations, and challenges in power quality. The influence of EV charging on the electrical grid is multifaceted and can vary significantly based on charging behavior, use time, and the underlying infrastructure’s capacity to absorb these loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>One critical aspect of power system modeling is the representation of the slack bus, which serves as a reference point for voltage and power flow in a power system. The slack bus compensates for the network’s active and reactive power imbalances, ensuring the system operates within its designated parameters. The behavior of the slack bus is pivotal when integrating additional loads, such as those introduced by EVs. Understanding how the slack bus interacts with the added demand from EVs provides insight into grid stability and reliability. This study aims to analyze the slack bus’s effect on EV integration into the power grid using machine learning techniques. By employing data-driven methodologies, we will explore the impact of EV loads on bus voltages and slack bus performance, ultimately seeking to identify strategies for optimizing grid operation in the context of increasing EV adoption. Through simulation and analysis, this research will contribute to developing frameworks that enhance grid resilience and promote sustainable energy solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>Intelligent systems transform how complex processes are optimized in logistics and operations management, particularly in critical infrastructures like power grids. EV integration presents a unique challenge for grid operators due to the fluctuating demand and load variation that EV charging imposes. The slack bus, a reference node that balances power generation and consumption across the grid, is one critical factor in maintaining grid stability. By incorporating machine learning techniques, the behavior of the slack bus can be analyzed and predicted more accurately, allowing for optimized EV integration without compromising grid performance. Machine learning models can assess real-time data from the power grid to predict load variations caused by EV charging and adjust the power distribution accordingly. This proactive approach reduces the risk of power imbalances, minimizes operational costs, and enhances the overall reliability of the grid. Machine learning enables more efficient grid operation by automating the decision-making process in power flow management, ultimately supporting the large-scale adoption of EVs while maintaining grid stability.</p><p>The integration of EVs into the power grid necessitates understanding various types of buses used in power systems, which serve as critical nodes for power distribution, connecting generation, transmission, and end-user loads, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>. The three primary types of buses are the Slack Bus, also known as the reference bus, which plays a crucial role in maintaining voltage stability by compensating for active and reactive power imbalances from load fluctuations; the Load Bus, representing points in the grid where power is consumed, such as residential or commercial areas, which connect various loads, including EV charging stations, and experience significant voltage changes as EV penetration increases. The Generator Bus is connected to power generation sources like traditional power plants and renewable energy facilities, which must adapt to the increasing demand from EVs. Understanding the functions and interactions of these buses is vital for successful EV integration into the power grid, as their coordination is key to maintaining system reliability, managing voltage levels, and ensuring efficient energy distribution amid rising EV adoption.</p>

            <title>2.1. Problem formulation</title>
          
          <p>As EVs become more prevalent, their integration into existing power grids presents several challenges that must be addressed to ensure reliable operation. One of the primary issues is the increased demand for electricity. The growing number of EVs leads to heightened electrical demand, especially during peak charging times. This surge can strain the capacity of existing infrastructure, resulting in voltage drops, transformer overloads, and even potential outages. Consequently, the integration of EVs necessitates a thorough evaluation of the existing grid's capacity to accommodate these additional loads. Another significant challenge is voltage stability. Adding EV loads can cause substantial voltage fluctuations across the power network, threatening the reliable operation of power systems, particularly in regions with a high penetration of EVs. Maintaining voltage stability is critical to ensuring the safety and efficiency of the grid. Therefore, it is essential to understand how varying levels of EV integration impact the overall voltage profile within the system.</p><p>Additionally, power flow management becomes increasingly complex due to the dynamic nature of EV charging, which is often influenced by user behavior and charging patterns. Traditional power system models may not adequately capture these complexities, leading to inefficiencies in energy distribution and potential service disruptions. Therefore, there is a need for improved models that can account for the variability introduced by EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Finally, the role of the slack bus is crucial in this context. The slack bus serves as a reference point for power flow in the system and compensates for power imbalances as EV loads are added. Understanding how the slack bus behaves under varying EV load conditions is essential for ensuring overall grid stability. By analyzing the interactions between EV loads and the slack bus, insights can be gained about managing power flows effectively.</p>

            <title>2.2. Novelty</title>
          
          <p>The novelty of this study lies in its innovative approach to integrating machine learning techniques with traditional power system analysis to evaluate the impact of EV loads on the power grid. One key aspect of this research is its data-driven analysis. By utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze historical charging data, the study aims to predict future EV load patterns more accurately. This allows for enhanced modeling of how EV integration will affect grid operations and facilitates better decision-making for grid operators. Another novel element is the specific focus on the slack bus. While much existing research has examined the overall effects of EVs on grid performance, this study zeroes in on the behavior of the slack bus in response to added EV loads. This concentrated investigation provides deeper insights into the dynamics of power flow and voltage stability, which are often overlooked in broader analyses.</p><p>Furthermore, the research includes the simulation of diverse scenarios. By simulating various charging scenarios and time-of-use patterns, the study offers a comprehensive understanding of the potential operational challenges and solutions that grid operators may face as EV adoption rises. This approach enhances the analysis’s predictive capabilities and helps identify critical thresholds for voltage stability. Lastly, developing an optimization framework incorporating machine learning predictions for load management and grid operation is a significant contribution of this study. This framework enhances the grid’s ability to adapt to fluctuating demand, improving overall efficiency and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several key research questions have been formulated to guide the investigation into the integration of EVs within power grids. These questions aim to explore the implications of EV loads on grid stability, understand the operational dynamics of the slack bus, and assess the potential of predictive modeling in optimizing grid management. By addressing these inquiries, the study seeks to provide a deeper understanding of effectively integrating EVs into the existing power infrastructure while maintaining reliability and stability. The specific research questions are as follows: </p><p>•How does integrating EV loads affect voltage stability across different buses in the power grid?</p><p>•What role does the slack bus play in compensating for power imbalances introduced by varying EV charging levels?</p><p>•Can machine learning models accurately predict EV charging behaviors, and how do these predictions influence grid management strategies?</p><p>•What optimization strategies can grid operators implement to effectively manage the increased demand from EVs while ensuring reliable power delivery?</p>

      <p>The IEEE 11-bus system is a valuable testbed for analyzing EV integration into the power grid despite being less commonly referenced than the 9-bus or 14-bus systems. It facilitates the study of dynamic load variations caused by EV charging, which lead to fluctuating demand profiles and impact load balancing across various buses. Additionally, the system enables the examination of voltage stability at buses near charging stations and the role of the slack bus in compensating for increased power demand. Power flow optimization ensures minimal losses and efficient distribution to charging points without overloading any part of the grid. Moreover, machine learning models can be applied within this framework to predict the effects of EV load on grid behavior, including voltage drops and necessary adjustments to maintain stability. Overall, the IEEE 11-bus system effectively models and studies the integration of EVs and the contribution of intelligent systems in sustaining grid reliability and performance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> illustrates the relationship between initial bus voltages, EV loads at different penetration levels, and the corresponding changes in slack bus voltage and compensation needs as EV integration progresses.

Additionally, it specifies the peak demand times, indicating the hours during which charging demand was highest, which is crucial for understanding grid load management. The voltage levels at the charging stations during each session, measured in volts (V), are included to assess the stability of the power supply. In contrast, the power flow, represented in megawatts (MW), illustrates the electricity supplied to the grid at that time. This dataset is essential for analyzing the impact of EV charging on grid operations, identifying peak load periods, and developing strategies for effective energy management in the context of increasing EV integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p>

          <p>The simulation framework for this study is developed using advanced power system analysis tools, such as PandaPower or MATPOWER. These software packages provide robust environments for modeling and analyzing electrical power systems, enabling researchers to simulate various grid configurations and evaluate the impact of EV integration under different scenarios. The framework allows for detailed modeling of the power grid, including components such as buses, transformers, and transmission lines, facilitating a comprehensive representation of real-world systems. By incorporating different levels of EV penetration, the simulations can assess how varying numbers of EVs influence grid stability and performance. Additionally, the framework supports the simulation of diverse charging patterns, reflecting real-world charging behaviors, which may vary based on user preferences, time of day, and geographic location. Time-of-use tariffs can also be integrated into the simulations, providing insights into how pricing structures affect EV charging behavior and peak load management. Through these simulations, researchers can analyze critical performance metrics such as voltage stability, power flow, and the behavior of the slack bus under various operational scenarios.

      <title>4. Results and discussion</title>
      <p>Before EV load integration, bus voltages in the power grid typically remain stable, operating close to nominal values (e.g., 230V) with minimal fluctuations. Voltage regulation equipment like transformers and capacitors helps maintain these levels while the slack bus balances minor imbalances. However, significant voltage drops occur after EV load integration, especially during peak charging times when many EVs are connected simultaneously. Buses closer to high-demand areas experience more pronounced drops, leading to uneven voltage distribution and possible instability. The slack bus plays a critical role in compensating for power imbalances, but as EV penetration increases, it may reach its capacity limits. This challenges voltage regulation equipment, which must operate more frequently to maintain voltage levels, risking efficiency losses and wear. Without effective mitigation strategies such as smart charging, grid upgrades, or improved voltage regulation, the power grid may face instability and reduced power quality due to these fluctuations.</p>
      <p>The slack bus voltage experiences fluctuations over time as the EV load increases or decreases, particularly during peak charging hours, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>. Initially, when the EV load is low, the slack bus voltage remains stable at or near its nominal value (e.g., 1.0 p.u. or 230V, depending on the system). As EVs begin to charge during peak periods, the increased demand causes a significant drop in voltage across the grid. For example, during a high-demand period, the slack bus voltage may drop from 1.0 p.u. to 0.95 p.u. or lower, reflecting the increased stress on the system. As the slack bus compensates by injecting more power to balance the system, its voltage may stabilize temporarily, but continued high demand can push it further down. Over time, fluctuations occur as charging patterns change; for instance, during off-peak hours, the slack bus voltage may recover to around 0.98 p.u., but the repeated fluctuations challenge the slack bus’s ability to maintain stability. If the EV load becomes too erratic or intense, the slack bus voltage could drop below critical thresholds (e.g., 0.9 p.u.), risking voltage instability and power quality issues across the grid.</p>

The x-axis represents time, typically in hours, allowing observation of slack bus voltage fluctuations related to EV charging patterns throughout the day. The y-axis shows the voltage level at the slack bus in V, serving as a reference point for the entire power system. As EV loads fluctuate, corresponding changes in slack bus voltage are observed; for instance, noticeable drops during peak charging times, such as early evenings, due to increased electricity demand, while off-peak periods may see voltage stabilization. The extent of these fluctuations indicates the impact of EV integration on the grid, with significant drops highlighting potential voltage stability issues and the grid’s ability to handle increased loads. Analyzing the overall trend reveals a consistent pattern of how slack bus voltage responds to EV load changes, underscoring the correlation between EV charging timing and voltage levels and emphasizing the need for effective grid management strategies during high-demand periods. Additionally, understanding these fluctuations is vital for guiding voltage regulation implementation and may indicate the necessity for infrastructure upgrades, such as enhanced voltage regulation capabilities or energy storage systems. Thus, this graph serves as a crucial tool for assessing the impact of EV load fluctuations on slack bus voltage, informing better operational practices and infrastructure planning in the evolving landscape of EV integration into power systems.</p>

      <p>The comparison between actual and predicted EV load involves evaluating how accurately machine learning models forecast the EV charging demand based on historical data. The actual EV load represents the real-world demand for electricity from EVs at various times. This data is collected from charging stations, utilities, and other sources, and it fluctuates depending on factors such as time of day, user behavior, location, and the number of EVs connected to the grid. For example, peak demand may occur in the evening when many users plug in their vehicles after work, leading to a surge in load.</p><p>Predicted EV load is generated using machine learning algorithms trained on historical EV charging data, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. These algorithms, such as regression models or time-series forecasting, aim to predict future load patterns based on inputs like past charging behavior, day of the week, and seasonal variations. A well-trained model might accurately predict a surge in demand during the evening hours or reduced load during the early morning. Accuracy: in most cases, predicted load values are close to actual values, especially during periods with consistent and predictable charging patterns. However, discrepancies can occur due to unexpected events, such as weather changes or public holidays, which may alter user behavior. For instance, a model might predict an evening load of 50 MW, but the actual load could be 55 MW due to a sudden increase in EV charging. Performance Metrics: The accuracy of the prediction is often measured using metrics such as MAE and RMSE. A low MAE or RMSE indicates that the predicted values are close to the actual load, while higher values suggest a larger gap between the predicted and actual demand. In conclusion, while predicted EV load can often closely follow actual demand, real-world fluctuations, and uncertainties make it challenging to achieve perfect alignment. Continuous refinement of machine learning models helps improve prediction accuracy, enabling better grid management and planning for EV integration.</p>

      <p>Validation is critical in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the models developed for predicting EV load impacts on power grid stability. In this study, validation involves comparing the results obtained from machine learning models against actual grid performance data to assess their effectiveness in forecasting real-time load demands and voltage stability. Various metrics, such as MAE and RMSE, quantify the model’s predictive accuracy. By applying cross-validation techniques, we can minimize overfitting and ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data. Furthermore, scenario analysis uses historical charging patterns and operational metrics to evaluate the models’ performance across different EV penetration levels and grid configurations. The successful validation of these models enhances confidence in their application for grid management, providing actionable insights for operators to optimize slack bus compensation and maintain voltage stability. Ultimately, robust validation processes contribute to developing reliable forecasting tools for navigating the challenges posed by increasing EV integration into the power grid.</p>
