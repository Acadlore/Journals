      <abstract><p>The pimary goal of this research was to delineate optimal zones for the establishment of wells by integrating geophysical and hydrogeological techniques, namely electrical resistivity tomography and piezometric analysis. Carried out on the southern flank of Mount Bamboutos within the Menoua Division in Cameroon, the current study addressed the local issue of inadequate water supply, which persists in view of the scarcity of water resources and limited success achieved by previous initiatives. A total of 21 wells and 31 Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) locations were investigated and seven distinct geophysical anomalies were identified, with resistivity values ranging from 28.61 to 216 703 $\Omega \cdot$m, and thicknesses varying from 0.228 to 46.64 meters. The anomalies were associated with weathered geological formations, including decomposed rocks, fractured basaltic trachytes, and alteritic layers. Considerable spatial variations were found in hydraulic parameters: (i) Hydraulic conductivity ranged between 0.004 and 16.915 m/day; (ii) Transmissivity values extended from 0.017 to 227.841 m$^2$/day; and (iii) Porosity estimates fluctuated between 0.736% and 38.226%. Aquifers hosted in alteritic materials were found at depths about 1.63 to 26 m whereas those associated with fractured basaltic trachytes exceeded 26 m in depth. Piezometric measurements revealed a predominant groundwater flow direction from the northeast toward the southwest. Depressed hydraulic head zones, particularly in the southwestern and central areas, were considered favorable for groundwater exploitation. Aquifer thicknesses ranged from 14.7 to 46.6 m primarily concentrated in the southwestern, southeastern, central, and northern parts of the study area. Based on the integration of geophysical and piezometric data, a hydrogeological map was generated to highlight several promising zones for borehole development. The map serves as a practical decision-support tool to select favorable drilling sites, reduce borehole failure rates and directly support the planning of local water supply. The outcome of this multidisciplinary investigation provided valuable contributions to guide the sustainable management and development of groundwater resources in the region.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Water, representing one of the most basic necessities of life, plays a critical role in sustaining ecosystems and human well-being. As global population and economic activities expand, there is a considerable increase in the demand for water. Many parts of the world are, however, experiencing significant water shortages, leading to an alarming situation which inhabitants should be highly conscious and attentive, so better conservation of resources, in particular water resources, is urgently required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Over the last century, global water consumption has multiplied sixfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] and continues to rise as a result of unchecked urban development; for many Africans, access to reliable water distribution networks remains to be limited. In general, human consumption of water primarily relies on either surface water or groundwater derived from aquifers. Groundwater, which resides beneath the Earth’s surface inside soil pores and fractured rock formations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], accounts for approximately 98% to 99% of the terrestrial soft water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Due to limited accessibility, groundwater is less vulnerable to contamination and relatively well-protected from sources of pollution such as animal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. The Menoua Division is a specific case where several sources of surface water are subject to risks of contamination from agricultural runoff like fertilizers and pesticides, untreated domestic wastewater, and livestock activities. Previous studies in the western highlands reported elevated concentrations of nitrates and coliform bacteria in streams though boreholes and hand-dug wells generally met the standards of drinking water stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO). This background highlighted the importance of groundwater as a comparatively safer and more reliable resource for the local population. Cameroon is no exception to this situation, despite numerous hydraulic projects implemented in both rural and urban areas.</p><p>Although Cameroon is abundant in water resources, with approximately 120 billion m³ of usable groundwater resources, its distribution is unevenly spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. In many rural areas of Cameroon such as the Nord-Est region of the Menoua Division, water supply is primarily reliant on hand-dug wells and boreholes aimed at locating sources of groundwater that generally meet the standards of the WHO in terms of quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately, the access of groundwater in Cameroon remains to be limited. To ensure proper management and utilization of underground water, it is necessary to conduct geological, hydrogeological, and geophysical surveys, which provide invaluable knowledge regarding the geometric, electrical, and hydrodynamic characteristics of aquifers to serve as a guide for siting various hydraulic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. In hydrogeology, various techniques including electrical methods and remote sensing are vital for accurately identifying and describing aquifers, in order to support effective groundwater development strategies. These methods help to identify areas with high groundwater potential and determine suitable locations for the installation of hand-dug wells and boreholes, thus improving the water conditions and access for the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>The access to safe drinking water remains a significant challenge in various regions of Cameroon, largely due to factors such as high population pressure, inadequate investment in the water sector, and the impacts of climate change. This unfortunate situation leaves approximately 70% to 80% of the towns in Cameroon running without access to reliable water sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. The problem of inadequate water supply is even more severe in rural areas where the majority of population relies heavily on both ground and surface water to meet their basic needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. To address the problem of water accessibility, numerous well and borehole projects have been implemented. However, these projects faced significant failure rates, which lead to social and financial complications. It is therefore imperative to exercise caution in the selection and placement of hydraulic structures such as wells and boreholes, in order to ensure that they are situated in favorable zones. The population in the study area is particularly affected by these challenges as a significant portion of the community relies on underground water resources for their daily activities. Nevertheless, several wells in the area have dried up, and others have been abandoned due to various reasons. Either the true water accumulation zones were not accurately identified in the areas with dried-up wells, or the wells were constructed in unfavorable locations due to a lack of knowledge regarding the geophysics and hydrogeology of the area. Consequently, some residents resort to sources of surface water that are prone to pollution and serious health risks, including the transmission of waterborne diseases.</p><p>Additionally, Dumort’s work in 1968 revealed that the study area was encompassed by two volcanic formations consisting of basalt and trachytes. Nzolang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] further established that the basement rocks comprised granites and gneiss of Pan-African origin. Moreover, Tematio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] provided evidence that our study area was characterized by ferralitic soils. Although these previous studies focused on petrology and pedology, no specific research was conducted on the hydrogeology of the Nord-Est part of the Menoua Division. To effectively exploit groundwater from subterranean aquifers, it is essential to gain preliminary knowledge of the hydrogeological and geophysical characteristics, such as depth, thickness, resistivity, and hydrodynamics of the aquifers. Therefore, our purpose was to employ 1D and 2D inversion in studying the underground aquifers of the Nord-Est part of the Menoua Division, with an aim of proposing a potential hydrogeological map for the area.</p><p>Within the scope of this study, geophysical methods, specifically 2D electrical resistivity tomography using the Schlumberger apparatus, were employed in conjunction with piezometric investigations. This approach enabled us to determine the resistivity of different formations, and to understand the distribution of resistivity of the subsurface rock in both depth and lateral dimensions. Additionally, it allowed us to determine the geometry of the underground aquifers and the various piezometric characteristics, which provide insights into the hydrodynamics of the aquifer system. These findings served as a valuable guide in the mapping of groundwater resources, facilitating a reliable assessment of the hydrogeological units within the subsurface.</p>

      <title>2. Natural setting</title>
      <p>The study area, located on the southern flank of Mount Bamboutos, constitutes a section of the western highlands of Cameroon; it is between latitudes 5°32'0"N and 5°32'45"N, as well as between longitudes 10°7'0"E and 10°7'45"E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>a. The hydrography of the region is relatively underdeveloped and features a parallel network of water bodies originating from Mount Bamboutos. The digital elevation model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>b illustrates elevations ranging from 1530 to 1710 m. The landscape is characterized by hills and a valley formed as a result of tectonic and volcanic activities. According to Morin in year 1988, five distinct morphologic levels could be observed and further divided into three divisions. The inferior surfaces, with altitudes ranging from 1530 to 1566 m, are primarily located in the southern part of the study zone. The intermediate surface elevations vary between 1566 and 1638 m, whereas the higher elevations, extending from 1638 to 1710 m, are mainly located in the northern sector of the investigated zone.</p>

      <p>The slope map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>c depicts five distinct classes of landscapes characterized by varied slopes. Smooth landscapes with slopes below 7° are mainly found in the southern part of the study area. Undulating landscapes with slopes ranging from 7° to 14°, and steep landscapes with slopes exceeding 14° are primarily observed in the northern part of the study area. To streamline this description and better align it with the hydrogeological objectives in this study, we emphasize that gentle southern slopes favor infiltration and groundwater recharge, while steep northern slopes promote surface runoff, hence limiting infiltration and reducing groundwater accumulation. Thus, slope variations directly influence the spatial distribution of aquifers in the area.</p><p>The study area is composed of a basement of Precambrian granite and gneiss of Pan-African age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]; it is covered at the surface by volcanic formations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> and consists of: (i) Basalt, covering about 60% of the study zone, is a type of volcanic rock issued from rapid cooling of magma characterized by minerals such as plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivines; (ii) Trachyte, covering about 40% of the study zone, is an explosive volcanic rock rich in alkaline feldspars like sanidine, albite, and anorthose.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>This study adopted a dual-approach methodology comprising Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) based on the Schlumberger array, and complementary hydrogeological investigations. For the component of the VES, fieldwork entailed a careful selection of appropriate locations to cater for the research objectives and geological considerations. The setup of equipment involved the placement of a resistivity meter and electrode arrays in accordance with the Schlumberger configuration. Data were collected by measuring resistivity at each VES point so as to ensure proper contact and stability of the electrodes. Essential field data, such as electrode spacing and observed geological features, were recorded. The collected VES data subsequently underwent laboratory processing, which involved utilization of suitable software and algorithms to process the data, generate iso-resistivity maps, and perform 1D and 2D geophysical inversions for interpretations. Eqs. (1) and (2) presented below summarize the necessary conversions required to obtain the apparent resistivity values.</p>

          <p>The current analysis highlighted low resistivity anomalies, generally corresponding to weathered alterites and fractured basaltic trachytes, which constitute the main aquifer-bearing formations. In contrast, high resistivity zones are associated with compact, unweathered volcanic rocks and granitic basement units that are less favorable for groundwater storage. This link between resistivity distribution and local lithological structures provided clearer evidence of the relationship between electrical signatures and aquifer occurrence in the study area.</p><p>These findings exhibited similarities with the research conducted by the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] in the Foto, Keleng, and Foréke regions. However, they differed from the results obtained by the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] in Ngoua (Dschang). In the Ngoua region of west Cameroon, iso-resistivity maps revealed both high and low resistivity domains at different depths of AB/2, i.e., 1.5 to 160 m.

Zones with high K and Tr values are likely associated with fractured and permeable formations, such as weathered basalt, which tend to facilitate the movement of fluid. Conversely, low values are indicative of less permeable, possibly clay-rich or compacted layers which limit groundwater flow. This heterogeneity directly impacts aquifer development: productive boreholes are most likely to succeed in high K and Tr zones, while low-parameter areas pose risks of reduced yields or failure. Therefore, site-specific surveys remain essential before drilling and well siting strategies should prioritize the most permeable zones identified, while zones with lower parameters might require reinforcement measures such as deeper drilling or artificial recharge techniques to improve success rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>].</p>
          <p>By utilizing different aquifer levels and hydraulic parameters, a map is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_10">Figure 10</xref> to tentatively depict the spatial distribution of aquifer thicknesses. These thicknesses range from 2.6 to 46.7 m and interestingly the values align closely with the findings of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] in the Ngoua locality of Dschang, where aquifer thicknesses range from 2 to 74 m. Specifically, depths ranging from 2.6 to 13.5 m may correspond to the observed maximum level of wells in the field, whereas depths from 13.5 to 25.6 m correspond to aquifer levels in alterite formations. Besides, depths from 25.6 to 46.6 m indicate aquifer levels within more or less consolidated and fractured rocks. This classification differs somewhat from the findings of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] in Dschang and its surrounding areas, where geophysical studies revealed the presence of two types of aquifers, including an alteration-based aquifer ranging from 21.5 to 28 m deep and a fractured aquifer from 28 to 40 m deep.</p>

          <p>The presence of four concentric hollows or depressions in the low piezometric level zone represents recharge zones, while the piezometric domes in the north signify areas of water table discharged through precipitation infiltration. The southwest and center of the study area, characterized by a depression zone, are favorable for capturing water as it accumulates from the piezometric domes. Consequently, the predominant direction of groundwater flow is from the northeast to the southwest, diverging primarily in the north and converging in the south, whereas surface water follows the northeast-southeast direction, aligning with the hydrographic network as a source of water table.</p><p>To highlight the practical significance of these dynamics, recharge mainly occurs through rainfall infiltration on higher elevation slopes and piezometric domes, where fractured volcanic rocks favor downward percolation. Discharge mechanisms, on the other hand, are concentrated in the southwestern depressions, where groundwater accumulates and can be sustainably extracted. This interaction between recharge and discharge zones explains the spatial variability of groundwater availability and provides essential guidance for selecting borehole sites with higher success rates.</p>

The synthesis of these variables allowed classification of the region into three main categories of hydrogeological potential.</p><p>Located primarily in the northeastern and parts of the central zone, low potential areas are composed of about 10% of the territory; they are defined by limited aquifer thickness ranging from 2.6 to 13.5 m and by geoelectrical responses of types K and AK curves. These zones generally suggest poor groundwater productivity due to low permeability and minimal water retention capacity.</p><p>Moderate potential zones extend roughly over 40% of the study area, encompassing segments of the northeast, center, and southern portions. Aquifer layers in these zones range between 13.5 and 14.7 m in thickness, and the VES curves of types K and Q are predominant. These areas reflect medium hydrogeological characteristics, possibly associated with mixed lithological units of weathered materials and fractured rock zones which offer modest water yields.</p><p>High potential areas represent around 50% of the mapped zone and are primarily situated in the southwest, southeast, central, and portions of the northern regions. These areas are marked by thicker aquifer layers from 14.7 to 46.6 meters and associated with highly productive VES curves such as H, KH, KHK, and QH. The presence of these types of curves, in conjunction with high transmissivity and porosity values, suggests favorable geological structures conducive to groundwater storage and movement as in the examples of deep weathered profiles and fractured volcanic rocks.</p>
          <p>To ensure scientific validity and reproducibility, the classification thresholds are defined as follows: (i) Low potential zones correspond to aquifer thickness $&lt;$13.5 m and transmissivity $&lt;$40 m<inline-formula>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The purpose of this work was to assess aquifers in the northeastern Menoua Division through 1D and 2D resistivity inversion techniques, thereby informing future water supply initiatives. Due to increasing population, overuse of surface water, and past project failures, reliance on groundwater resources has become critical and they deserve better preservation. The geophysical survey revealed three distinct resistivity domains: the resistant domain in the northeast, characterized by compacted soils and rocky formations upstream transitioning to more permeable rocks downstream; the central region with basaltic trachyte formations, indicating potential aquifers; and conductive zones dominated by alterites upstream and fractured rocks downstream. Aquifers in alterite zones vary in depth from 1.6 to 26 m, while those in fractured rocks extend beyond 26 m. Hydraulic parameters and the hydrogeological map indicate that aquifers in the southwest and southeast regions are more productive, with aquifer thicknesses ranging from 14.7 to 46.6 m, rendering these areas ideal for hand-dug wells and borehole installations. Additionally, piezometric studies suggested a groundwater flow from northeast to southwest with depression zones in the southwest and central parts, hence attesting to the suitability for water capture in the area. This study highlighted key aquifer characteristics and identified regions most suitable for projects about sustainable water supply, emphasizing the importance of groundwater resources to address local water challenges.</p><p>Looking ahead, future research should focus on integrating geophysical investigations with hydrochemical analyses to improve groundwater quality assessment, testing artificial recharge methods to enhance the sustainability of aquifers, and applying remote sensing for continuous monitoring of aquifer dynamics. Further efforts should be made to develop predictive models that minimize borehole failure rates and increase the efficiency of groundwater development, thereby ensuring the long-term resilience of water supply systems in the Menoua Division and other similar volcanic regions.</p>
