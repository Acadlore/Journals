      <abstract><p>Business development and environmental preservation are the two aspects of today’s global concerns. SDG’s implementation at the root level is the only solution to achieve the two ends. This has created an urge for green investment, which can contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The present research focuses on finding the impact of Green Investment Capacity, Green Risk Tolerance and green risk appetite on Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus and Green Portfolio Strategy. Furthermore, the current study also attempts to analyse the influence of Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus and Green Portfolio Strategy on SDG-12-aligned investment decisions. Based on responses collected through the questionnaire and application of SMART PLS-4, it was found that a significant relationship exists between the variables. The present study provides a framework for achieving SDG-12 through appropriate investment pathways.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of global finance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], where the urgency of addressing environmental challenges has never been more pressing, the integration of Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] into investment strategies has emerged as a critical framework, guiding investors towards the adoption of Green Investment Capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], Green Risk Tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], and green risk appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], all of which are pivotal in shaping Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] and Green Portfolio Strategies that not only aim to achieve substantial financial returns but also ensure that these returns are aligned with sustainable consumption and production patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], thereby fostering long-term environmental sustainability, reducing the ecological footprint, and driving a more resilient and responsible investment landscape that is attuned to the principles of sustainable development and responsible environmental stewardship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>The population of the globe is increasing very rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The aggregate demand and population have a direct relationship with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Hence consumption is increasing at a very large scale that is being balanced with parallel production. This creates an urge for responsible consumption. Making consumption responsible and eco-friendly is important because production can be made greener only when it meets demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Moreover, investment and production again are positively related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Green investment can drive sustainable production and consumption by providing the financial resources needed to innovate eco-friendly technologies, incentivizing businesses to adopt sustainable practices, and encouraging consumers to prioritize environmentally conscious products and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. If investors are persuaded to develop green risk appetite, then it would be easier for the producers to meet rise in consumption through greener means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>This research is essential in advancing a profound understanding of how the integration of SDG 12—focused on responsible consumption and production—within investment strategies can engender transformative financial models that transcend traditional economic growth metrics, enabling a paradigm shift towards an intricate, interdependent framework where capital flows are intricately synchronized with environmental stewardship, resource conservation, and the overarching pursuit of sustainability, thereby fostering a holistic approach to economic development that prioritizes the equilibrium between profitability, environmental integrity, and societal well-being on a global scale.</p><p>The majority of nations on the planet are developing. Development seems to come at the cost of the deterioration of the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. This has to change by any means. SDGs can be achieved only when there is no other option except being green in all human activities (investment, production and consumption) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>The increase in the urgency of the environmental issues along with global commitments to attain the SDG 12 on the responsible consumption and production, requires a further insight into what financial, behavioral, and strategic factors influence sustainable investment decisions; thus, the current research is quite timely and inevitable. Even though there is rising consciousness about green finance, there has been a continued inconsistency in the actual execution of green stewardship as it applies to investment strategies. The practicality has mostly been affected by low risk appetite, limited financial resources, and non-compatibility of portfolio management approaches and sustainability goals. Previous research has principally studied these aspects on a standalone basis, and has neglected the relationship between behavioral drivers (e.g. risk tolerance and risk appetite), structural enablers (e.g. investment capacity), and strategic mediators (e.g. green portfolio design). What is more, the practical application of such factors into tangible SDG 12 results is underdeveloped which creates a shortcoming between the policy and investor concrete activity. The study manages to fill that gap when tested empirically the role of financial and behavioral constructs in informing the investment focus on environmental stewardship and portfolio choices and how such choices can serve the SDG 12 aligned investment options.</p><p>The study is able to achieve and go beyond the theoretical contribution in the fields of sustainable finance and behavioral investment as stemming by the capture of these relationships within a powerful set of PLS SEM, but also to derive practical implications and actionable recommendations to policy makers, financial institutions, and individual investors, therefore, contributing to its mismatch between the theory and the practice of sustainability in the capital market.</p><p>This research paper is indispensable for those seeking to delve into the multifaceted intricacies of how embedding SDG 12 into investment strategies can precipitate a transformative reorientation of financial paradigms, fostering an era where capital deployment is meticulously harmonized with principles of resource efficiency, environmental stewardship, and ethical governance, thereby offering profound insights into the nexus between economic growth, sustainability, and corporate responsibility, which are poised to redefine the very contours of global financial ecosystems in the decades to come.</p><p>The current study first presents the research questions it aims to address and its theoretical foundations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, followed by a literature review of related studies. After discussing the methodology, an in-depth data analysis is made by using the software of SMART PLS 4 followed by discussion and conclusion.</p>

Recent literature demonstrates that other factors, including cognitive biases of investors such as loss aversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>], overconfidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>], and herding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>], play a significant role in the proliferation of sustainable portfolios compared to distortions at the macroeconomic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>]. The decision to move toward proactive impact investing and away from exclusionary screening highlights an emerging understanding that green investments need not trade off against financial returns: they may very well be competitive, and even fit more traditional financial profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>]. Additionally, the adoption of ESG metrics in real-time portfolio management, based on AI-powered analytics, has enhanced the speed and precision with which investment strategies are aligned with the SDGs, at least concerning SDG 12. Nonetheless, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the relationship between environmental stewardship intent and reality, particularly in terms of resource capital allocation, as influenced by psychological risk perceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>]. This disparity is especially accentuated in the case of emerging markets, where a policy framework and market maturity enhance the accessibility and perceived credibility of green financial products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">73</xref>]. Therefore, integrating behavioral finance research ideas with their technological and regulatory counterparts provides a more comprehensive theoretical framework to anticipate and enhance sustainable investment behavior.</p><p>H1: Green Investment Capacity and Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus: The literature on the impact of Green Investment Capacity on Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus extensively discusses how an investor's ability to allocate resources towards environmentally sustainable projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>]—driven by financial stability, knowledge, and commitment to green principles—plays a crucial role in determining the extent to which these investments prioritize environmental stewardship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>], with studies highlighting that a higher capacity for green investments often leads to more focused and effective strategies in environmental preservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>], sustainability initiatives, and responsible resource management, ultimately contributing to stronger alignment with SDGs and enhancing the overall impact of investments on ecological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>].</p><p>H2: Green Investment Capacity and Green Portfolio Strategy: The review of literature on the impact of Green

research consistently indicating that higher Green Investment Capacity enables investors to diversify their portfolios towards more sustainable sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>], enhance risk management in alignment with environmental goals, and implement strategies that are resilient to environmental risks while also contributing to long-term sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>], thus reinforcing the importance of financial capacity in driving effective and impactful green investment strategies that align with global sustainability standards and environmental stewardship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>].</p><p>H3: Green Risk Tolerance and Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus: The literature on the impact of Green Risk Tolerance on Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus highlights that an investor's willingness to endure potential financial losses in pursuit of sustainable and environmentally responsible investments significantly influences their commitment to environmental stewardship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>], with studies showing that higher Green Risk Tolerance allows investors to engage more deeply in green investments that may have uncertain or long-term returns but offer substantial environmental benefits, thereby enabling a more concentrated focus on strategies that prioritize ecological sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_84">84</xref>], responsible resource management, and alignment with broader environmental and sustainability goals, ultimately reinforcing the role of risk tolerance in driving the effectiveness and scope of environmental stewardship within investment portfolios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>].</p><p>H4: Green Risk Tolerance and Green Portfolio Strategy: The literature on the impact of Green Risk Tolerance on Green Portfolio Strategy suggests that an investor's capacity to accept and manage the risks associated with sustainable investments plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and composition of a Green Portfolio Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>], with research indicating that higher Green Risk Tolerance enables investors to incorporate a broader range of sustainable assets, including those with higher volatility or longer time horizons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>], into their portfolios, thereby fostering a more diversified and resilient investment strategy that is aligned with environmental goals, supports innovative and potentially disruptive green technologies, and enhances the overall sustainability impact of the portfolio, ultimately underscoring the importance of risk tolerance in crafting investment strategies that balance financial returns with environmental stewardship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>].</p><p>H5: Green Risk Appetite and Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus: The literature on green risk appetite's impact on Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus reveals that investors with a high appetite for risk are more likely to commit resources to emerging and innovative green technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_87">87</xref>], sustainable projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_88">88</xref>], and companies with uncertain or long-term returns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41-89</xref>], which significantly enhances their portfolio's focus on environmental stewardship by prioritizing investments that offer substantial potential for environmental impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>], thereby aligning their investment strategies with broader ecological goals and contributing to the advancement of sustainable development, as supported by studies emphasizing the critical role of risk appetite in driving investment decisions that balance financial returns with environmental

highlights that investors with a strong inclination towards higher-risk investments are more likely to incorporate a diverse range of sustainable and innovative assets into their portfolios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>], including those associated with higher volatility or longer-term payoffs, which in turn drives the development of a Green Portfolio Strategy that not only seeks financial returns but also prioritizes substantial environmental benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_91">91</xref>], thereby reinforcing the role of risk appetite in crafting investment strategies that are both resilient and aligned with long-term sustainability goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>], as supported by research indicating that a higher green risk appetite leads to more aggressive and forward-thinking approaches in green investing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_93">93</xref>].</p><p>H7: Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus and SDG-12 Aligned

      <title>3. Material and methods</title>
      <p>Making Green Portfolio Strategies to trigger green investments has become crucial for achieving the SDGs. The increase in investors' green risk appetite has led to a rapid evolution in the field of Green Investments. India's unique blend of rapid economic growth, vast green investment potential, diverse socio-economic conditions, and a strong policy focus on sustainability and SDG 12 makes it an ideal setting to explore the interplay of Green Risk Tolerance, green appetite, and innovative investment strategies. Hence, the present research has the scope to answer questions through responses collected from Indian Demography.</p><p>A questionnaire related to variables identified as research gaps was framed to answer the research questions. The questionnaire was changed through three rounds of expert discussion. Five professors from the field of finance were on the expert panel, and after three revisions, they finalised the fourth version of the questionnaire. Before forwarding the questionnaire to a more extensive respondent database, a pilot study was conducted by forwarding the questionnaire to 50 respondents. Out of 50, 17 met the criteria for being green investors. As per the threshold limit of a minimum of 10 respondents in the pilot study, the feedback of 17 respondents was considered sufficient to move to further research processes. Respondents suggested some changes in the questions in the pilot study. After making those changes, a questionnaire was deemed ready to be forwarded to a larger sample size.</p><p>After the questionnaire was set to collect responses from respondents, a group of investors was recognised as seed participants on social media apps such as Facebook, Telegram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and through emails. The identified group further submitted the questionnaire to its peers, and the process continued. We received a total of 476 responses. Out of 476, 77 responses were repetitive, so they were removed, and 48 were incomplete, so they were not considered. The final sample size was 342 respondents; the dissection of their demographic profile is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Applying SMART PLS 4 was valid in the study because it is well-suited to complex models with multiple latent constructs, small to medium-sized samples, and non-normal data distributions, which were the characteristics of our data. Since PLS SEM can simultaneously estimate both measurement and structural models, it is best suited for situations where one wishes to evaluate the reliability and validity of constructs as well as test the hypothesized relations. The selection of constructs, namely Green Investment Capacity, Green Risk Tolerance, green risk appetite, Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus, Green Portfolio Strategy, and SDG 12 aligned investment decision, was supported by both theory and past empirical research in the area of sustainable finance and behavioral investment models. All constructs were operationalized using established and well-established indicators from validated scales, adapted to fit the SDG 12 dimensions, to ensure content validity. The indicators were identified to encompass both measurable financial ones, such as portfolio allocation and strategy design, and intangible ones, including how environmental responsibility is perceived or how eager one is to take sustainability-linked risks. These two focal points ensured that the model can be used to characterize not only structural but also psychological features of the sustainable investment decision, thereby providing a more comprehensive picture of the routes toward SDG 12 compliance.</p>

      <p>The cross-loading analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref> underscores the discriminant validity of the model, as observed in the substantial factor loadings of indicators such as “Growth Potential” (0.898), “Long-term Financial Goals” (0.895), and “Comfort Level with Risk” (0.917) within their respective constructs, while items like “Acceptance of Losses” (0.857) and “Belief in Risk-taking” (0.883) reflect a strong alignment within green risk appetite, illustrating clear differentiation across latent variables; moreover, constructs such as Green Investment Capacity, represented by “Loan Consideration for Opportunities” (0.859), and SDG 12-Aligned Investment Decision, represented by “Use of Accessible Information” (0.901), further affirm the model’s structural robustness, with cross-loadings remaining consistently lower on non-corresponding constructs, thereby validating the theoretical distinctions inherent in the sustainability-driven investment landscape. The table shows how different investor behaviors and beliefs (“Acceptance of Losses”, “Belief in Risk-taking,” etc.) are most strongly connected to specific investment strategies and outcomes. For example, an investor's Acceptance of Losses is most closely tied to their Green Portfolio Strategy (0.565) and an investors Belief in Risk-taking is most strongly linked to their green risk appetite (0.883). Similarly, Comfort Level with Risk and Complexity Concern are primarily related to Green Risk Tolerance (0.917 and 0.885, respectively), while a Financial Stability Assessment is most connected to their Green Investment Capacity (0.819). This means that different aspects of an investor's mindset predict which part of a sustainable investing approach they'll adopt, such as building a green portfolio or being more comfortable with green-related risks.</p><p>The cross-loading table indicates how various investor attitudes, including the Real Estate or Infrastructure Focus and Willingness to Borrow, and general investment strategy, e.g. Green Investment Capacity and Green Risk Tolerance were related. Consider a score-card such that the higher the number (the loading) the stronger the relationship. As an example, when you peek at the line for Real Estate or Infrastructure Focus, the maximum is 0.890 in the column of Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus. It implies that those investors who focus more on real estate or infrastructure are the strongest in terms of the interest in environmental stewardship. It is equivalent to saying that this kind of investor is most probably an environmental steward.</p>

This indicates a high connection between the fact that the investor comes to the analysis tools and his willingness to create a diversified green portfolio. This table allows us to understand which particular investor behaviors and interests are most useful in determining the various lines of attack that they take concerning green investing. It practically informs us, that whenever an investor does X, he is likely most of the time to find himself doing Y.</p><p>The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> reveals critical multicollinearity considerations within the model, with particularly elevated VIF scores for constructs such as “Consulting with Family or Friends” (5.436), “Using Analysis Tools” (5.280), and “Dependence on Luck” (4.580), indicating potential redundancies in predictor variables, while more moderate VIF values for indicators like “Confidence in Allocation” (1.272) and “Asset Transfer Planning” (1.299) suggest minimal collinearity issues in those areas, thus highlighting the necessity for model optimisation to mitigate potential overfitting risks and enhance predictive validity across the spectrum of sustainability-oriented investment behaviours.</p>

      <p>The R2 values of this research have shown that the model is relevant to predictive significance of the core constructs, such as sustainable investment behavior. Although the R2 value of the Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus is 0.276, the key variance in this environmental aspect is 27.6 percent, which highlights the role that Green Investment Capacity, Green Risk Tolerance, and green risk appetite play in determining environmentally related investment focus. The R2 of 0.486 in the Green Portfolio Strategy indicates a moderate level of explanatory power, suggesting that approximately half of the variance in action relating to the portfolio can be explained by the same predictors, indicating their practicality in shaping the strategy. Although this R2 value of 0.258 is small, it is significant in the context of behavioral finance research, as numerous external factors influence human decisions. This finding suggests that environmental stewardship and portfolio strategy are two factors that, together, represent a realistic approach to further developing the concept of sustainable consumption and production. In total, these values indicate that the model explains a substantial proportion of variance in all dependent constructs, making it possible to translate them into actionable implications for designing policies and investment strategies that can influence capital to align with SDG 12 goals.</p><p>The statistical analysis shows that being ready to invest in green projects (having the capacity), being okay with new or higher risks in these projects (risk tolerance), and actively wanting to take on these risks (risk appetite) all make investors more likely to focus on environmental stewardship and create a green portfolio. In simpler terms, if an investor has the money, the courage, and the drive to fund environmentally friendly ideas, they will naturally prioritize companies that are good stewards of the environment and build a mix of investments that reflect this. Ultimately, having an environmental focus and creating a green portfolio directly lead to investment decisions that align with SDG 12, which focuses on ensuring that what we consume and produce is sustainable for the planet.

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>The results from the inferences present fascinating discernment into the dynamics of sustainable finance, mainly how different green characteristics impact investment behaviour aligned with SDG 12. Here’s a more in-depth plunge into the outcomes. The outcomes emphasise that Green Investment Capacity significantly influences both Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus and Green Portfolio Strategy. The more substantial consequence of Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus indicates that organisations with higher Green Investment Capacity manage to prioritise investments that concentrate on environmental stewardship. These conclusions align with previous examinations, underscoring economic capability's crucial role in helming green initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_104">104</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_105">105</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_106">106</xref>].</p><p>Green Risk Tolerance places a reasonable consequence on both Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus and Green Portfolio Strategy. This result reflects analysis indicating that while risk tolerance plays a function, it is often mediated by other factors, such as organisational culture or external market conditions. Green risk appetite demonstrates the most substantial influence among all predictors, significantly impacting both Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus. The exceptionally high T-statistics emphasise the robustness of this connection, notably with Green Portfolio Strategy, where green risk appetite influence is nearly dual that of Green Investment Capacity or Green Risk Tolerance. This aligns with contemporaneous publications underlining that an aggressive appetite for sustainable risks is a crucial enabler for organisations striving to innovate and diversify their portfolios in connection with SDG's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_107">107</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_108">108</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_109">109</xref>].</p><p>The trails from Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus to SDG 12 indicate the layered configuration of green decision-making. The stronger impact of Green Portfolio Strategy compared to Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus implies that strategic integration of sustainable lodestars into more comprehensive portfolios is a more assertive characteristic in attaining SDG 12. This finding constructs on earlier investigations, which highlight the strategic transformation from unattended stewardship investments to exhaustive portfolio alignment as a hallmark of advanced green frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_110">110</xref>].</p><p>The outcomes reverberate with contemporary analyses that emphasise the transformative function of sustainable finance in attaining SDG-aligned purposes. For example, previous research has also pinpointed Green Investment Capacity as a foundational driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_111">111</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_112">112</xref>].</p><p>The superiority of green risk appetite corresponds with global conclusions indicating that organisations with a bold standpoint toward sustainable risks surpass their conventional counterparts in green innovation. This is specifically applicable in developing countries, where first-mover benefits in green portfolios can generate considerable financial and reputational rewards. The path calculation through SEM to SDG-12 emphasises an development from stewardship-focused acquisitions to strategic portfolio alignment, reflecting sensations in developed economies. Nevertheless, the subtle role of Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus as a complementary rather than immediate pathway demonstrates space for policy-driven enhancements to strengthen its consequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_113">113</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_114">114</xref>].</p><p>This paper demonstrates that diversification of green investment ability, risk tolerance, and risk appetite directly enhances environmental management and green portfolio management, which subsequently contribute significantly to SDG 12-inspired investment strategies, thereby affording a measurable path towards sustainable consumption and production. The results of Green Investment Capacity in terms of SDG 12-consistent investment decisions are the direct facilitation of sustainable consumption and production patterns since Green Investment Capacity funds resource-efficient and circular economy projects. Green Risk Tolerance also adds value to SDG 12-compliant investment judgments, as it enables investors to deploy capital in innovative, start-up sustainable consumption and production projects. These projects may involve higher short-term risks but offer considerable longer-term positive environmental and societal impacts. Furthermore, the existence of a green risk appetite provides a functional complement to SDG 12-aligned investment preferences, as it encourages investors to proactively recognize and finance initiatives that stimulate sustainable consumption and production, even in the facade of greater apprehension or a non-traditional bearing. Above, a Green Portfolio Strategy adds considerable depth to the content of SDG 12-compatible investment decisions because it encompasses a portfolio of companies and projects with intensive waste-minimization criteria, while also supporting the circular economy model and optimizing resource efficiency across their operations. As a source of investment, environmental stewardship offers a protective aspect that can contribute positively to SDG 12, as it channels capital to companies that are engaged in minimizing and managing their environmental impact through the streamlined utilization of resources, reduction of waste, and recycling/regeneration activities. These efforts directly support the transition towards a sustainable pattern of consumption and production.</p><p>The findings of this study offer clear, actionable strategies for advancing SDG 12 across multiple stakeholder groups by directly linking Green Investment Capacity, risk tolerance, and risk appetite to measurable sustainability outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_115">115</xref>]. Policymakers can operationalize these insights by introducing targeted tax incentives, green bond subsidies and tiered rebates for institutional investors maintaining significant exposure to certified SDG 12 aligned assets while embedding behavioral finance principles such as framing sustainability as a low regret decision into public campaigns to overcome investor inertia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_116">116</xref>]. Financial institutions can embed ESG metrics and SDG 12 alignment scores into their credit risk and portfolio assessment frameworks, offer preferential loan terms to SMEs adopting closed loop production and launch SDG 12 Index Funds to attract sustainability conscious capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_117">117</xref>]. Individual investors can progressively reallocate portions of their portfolios into green ETFs, mutual funds and impact bonds screened for SDG 12 compliance while using robo advisors or AI driven platforms to optimize allocations in line with their green risk appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_118">118</xref>]. By coordinating these interventions through policy level incentives, institutional product innovations and informed retail participation the ecosystem can generate a compounding effect that accelerates sustainable consumption and production while delivering competitive financial returns.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The study comprehensively reveals that green risk appetite and Green Investment Capacity significantly influence both Green Portfolio Strategy and Environmental Stewardship Investment Focus, with strong support for the pivotal role of these constructs in shaping SDG 12-Aligned Investment Decisions, while robust discriminant validity and minimal collinearity issues enhance the reliability of the model, though opportunities for model refinement remain, particularly in addressing moderate model fit indices, aligning our findings with prior literature, which consistently emphasizes the criticality of risk tolerance, investment behaviors, and sustainability-driven financial strategies, thus underscoring the necessity for further exploration of external factors impacting green investment dynamics.</p><p>According to this study, the enhancement of environmental stewardship and Green Portfolio Strategies can be directly improved by the development of Green Investment Capacity, a more risk-accepting approach, and an increase in appetite for sustainability financing, which will ultimately be reflected in more informed investment decisions aligned with SDG 12. The findings point a clear way forward in implementing sustainability in the daily financial practice. In the future, there may be opportunities to conduct research on the influence of culture, social norms, and local market dynamics on investors' attitudes toward green finance, particularly through a comparative study of emerging economies and more developed markets. It is also interesting to learn how more recent financial instruments, including green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and tokenized carbon credits, are gaining momentum and whether they contribute to faster achievement of the goal of sustainable consumption and production. The level of investment in future sustainability research, including the changing rules and regulations, adequate disclosure of ESG practices, and technological advancements, could provide more insight and shape approaches to ensuring sustainability becomes core to the investment environment.</p>
