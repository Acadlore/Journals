      <title>4. Decision-making theories and models</title>
      <p>Various frameworks, including theories and decision-making models, help people and organizations make well-informed decisions. These ideas offer methods to comprehend, evaluate, and choose the optimal action. Several well-known theories and models of decision-making are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p><p>Rational Decision-Making Model: Based on economic theory, this model believes that people make decisions by weighing their possibilities and selecting the one with the most predicted value. It entails a systematic and rational procedure prioritizing decision optimization and goal clarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">71</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">72</xref>].</p><p>Bounded Rationality Model: Herbert A. Simon’s Bounded Rationality Model considers time, knowledge, and cognitive limits. Cognitive biases and decision-making play a role in sustainable energy analysis. This model has ramifications for several academic fields, including economics, psychology, and organizational behavior. It offers a more realistic explanation of human decision-making by considering the complexity and restrictions present in real-world circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_73">73</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">74</xref>].</p><p>Behavioral Decision-Making Model: This model investigates how psychological variables, emotions, and cognitive biases affect decision-making, drawing on behavioral economics and psychology. It emphasizes how people can deviate from rationality and become susceptible to prejudices such as anchoring, framing effects, and overconfidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">75</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">76</xref>].</p><p>Garbage Can Model: This model, which Cohen, March, and Olsen created, sees decision-making as a “garbage can” where issues, answers, and decision-makers come together randomly. Instead of following a systematic procedure, decisions are made on the spur of the moment, frequently reacting to unplanned circumstances or outside events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">77</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_78">78</xref>].</p><p>Cybernetic Model: This model has its roots in the idea of feedback loops, which see decision-making as an ongoing process that involves obtaining data, making modifications in response to feedback, and refining decisions over time. It focuses on flexibility and learning from results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_79">79</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_80">80</xref>].</p><p>Political Decision-Making Model: This paradigm, which acknowledges the impact of organizational politics, asserts that power struggles, coalition building, and negotiations occur within an organization to determine choices. It draws attention to stakeholders’ roles and conflicting interests in influencing choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_81">81</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_82">82</xref>].</p><p>Prospect Theory: This hypothesis, which Kahneman and Tversky developed, shows that people often assess possible losses and profits asymmetrically, undermining the notion that people make rational decisions. It presents the idea of “loss aversion” and implies that people frequently base their decisions on how they perceive their reference point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_83">83</xref>].</p><p>Game Theory: Game theory examines decision-making in interactive scenarios where the result of one participant’s choice depends on the decisions of other participants. It is extensively used in business planning, political science, and economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_84">84</xref>].</p></p><p>These decision-making theories and models provide a variety of perspectives to help in the understanding and enhancement of decisions. To negotiate difficulties and make wise decisions, decision-makers may use components from several theories, depending on the situation.</p>

            <title>4.1. Classical decision-making theories</title>
          
          <p>The fundamental ideas of classical decision-making theories serve as a roadmap for rational decision-making for both people and organizations. These ideas use methodical and logical procedures to make the best choices. Here are a few well-known traditional theories of decision-making:</p><p><p>Rational Choice Theory: This theory has its roots in classical economics, asserting that people should take decisions by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of many options and selecting the one that maximizes their expected utility. People are logical agents with distinct preferences who aim to maximize results and base their judgments on reliable and comprehensive information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_85">85</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_86">86</xref>].</p><p>Expected Utility Theory: A framework for decision-making is provided by this theory. It integrates the probabilities of various outcomes and quantifies preferences in terms of value. This theory considers both the values and probabilities associated with possible outcomes. It provides a systematic method for simulating decisions under uncertainty and is widely used in game theory and economic decision-making. It helps academics and individuals comprehend and anticipate rational decision-making processes in various situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_87">87</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_88">88</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_89">89</xref>].</p><p>Decision Trees: A visual depiction of choice alternatives, their outcomes, and their probability is offered by decision trees. This paradigm makes complicated choice scenarios easier to evaluate. It helps decision-makers evaluate the best options using branches and nodes to depict decision routes and uncertainty. Decision trees are frequently employed in risk analysis, project management, and operations research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_90">90</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_91">91</xref>].</p><p>Linear Programming: Linear programming makes finding the optimal result in a linear mathematical model easier with linear programming, a mathematical technique for optimizing decision variables subject to restrictions. It involves following linear restrictions and either maximizing or minimizing an objective function. It is extensively employed in resource allocation, supply chain management, and operations research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_92">92</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_93">93</xref>].</p><p>Utility Theory: The idea of utility, which stands for the arbitrary value or pleasure obtained from a result, extends the anticipated utility theory concept. It is utilized in research on consumer behavior, psychology, and economics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_94">94</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_95">95</xref>].</p></p><p>These traditional decision-making theories offer methods for evaluating options, considering preferences, and making the best judgments. Even though these theories presuppose a rational decision-making process, it’s critical to understand that cognitive constraints, uncertainty, and contextual variables frequently cause real-world judgments to diverge.</p>
