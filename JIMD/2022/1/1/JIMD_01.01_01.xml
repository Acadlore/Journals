      <p>Dear editors, reviewers, authors, readers, and other members of the whole scientific and professional community,</p><p>Welcome to this inaugural issue of Journal of Intelligent Management Decision (JIMD)!</p><p>On behalf of the editorial office, I am writing with great pleasure and sincere privilege to present the first issue of the journal JIMD.</p><p>In the last few years, there is a growing necessity for advanced intelligent management decisions, especially with the extensive application of artificial intelligence in virtually all fields of science, economy, and life. It can be observed that many conflicting indicators are involved in the complex nature and society systems. The conflicting aims need to be balanced by developing and applying intelligent management decision models, which represents a significant challenge in uncertain environments, given the limited resources, time, and funds available. &amp;amp;nbsp;In addition, an important task in modern society is the possibility to make adequate decisions in real time through quantitative and qualitative analysis. Such analysis enables decision-makers to make real-time decisions by looking at the real needs of the companies and the market at any moment. </p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">This first issue aims to give answers to many important questions related to the scope of the journal. This issue consists of seven very interesting high-quality papers, which apply decision models in various fields: in the green agriculture supply chain using a fuzzy approach, in the supply chain network based on blockchain technology, in the management of human capital development in the era of digitalization. In addition, digital marketing, quality models, MCDM model, and intelligent models related to Covid are discussed in this issue, shedding new lights on various management problems.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Journal of Intelligent Management Decision (JIMD) (ISSN 2958-0072) is a fully refereed international open access journal focusing on the state-of-the-art research of the intelligent management of various organizations that adopt information systems.
