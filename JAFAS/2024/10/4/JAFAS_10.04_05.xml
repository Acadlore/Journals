      <abstract><p>This study investigates the relationship between capital structure and financial performance at Robin Corporation Ltd, a leading beverage manufacturer in Zimbabwe. A quantitative research methodology was employed, with data collected from 31 employees through structured questionnaires. The study focuses on external and internal financing sources—debt, equity, retained earnings, and reserves—and their impact on the company’s financial outcomes. The analysis reveals a positive correlation between capital structure and financial performance, suggesting that both debt and equity financing play significant roles in shaping financial results. However, it was also observed that factors such as managerial efficiency, inflation, and broader economic conditions exert substantial influence on performance. While capital structure is a critical determinant, the results indicate that effective management of these other variables is equally essential for optimizing financial outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of strategic capital management in the Zimbabwean beverage sector, emphasizing that an appropriate balance between external and internal financing is pivotal for enhancing financial performance. The study contributes to the broader understanding of capital structure in emerging markets and provides valuable insights for companies seeking to navigate the complexities of financial decision-making in volatile economic environments.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The capital structure of a corporation refers to the mix of its long-term and short-term liabilities, as well as its common and preferred equity, and this combination is used to finance the company’s operations and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller, 1958</xref>). Understanding how capital structure affects financial performance is particularly significant in emerging markets like Zimbabwe, where economic instability, inflation, and currency fluctuations pose substantial challenges for companies, particularly in the beverage industry. The beverage industry serves as a critical sector for economic development, contributing to both employment and GDP. However, companies within this industry are faced with unique challenges, including volatile raw material prices, regulatory constraints, and intense competition, all of which influence their capital structure decisions and ultimately their financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Chikwira, 2023</xref>).</p><p>This research seeks to identify the elements that impact decisions regarding capital structure. Specifically, this research aims to identify factors that affect capital structure choices, focusing on both external sources (debt and equity) and internal sources (retained earnings and reserves). This examination is particularly pertinent given the challenges faced by the beverage industry in Zimbabwe, which include economic fluctuations and changing consumer preferences.</p><p>The problem statement for this research is anchored in the observation that many firms in Zimbabwe’s beverage industry struggle with financial performance issues, and there is an insufficient understanding of how variations in capital structure affect this performance. Previous studies have suggested that while capital structure is a critical determinant of financial performance, external economic factors, management efficiency, and industry-specific challenges may also play pivotal roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">Chikwira, 2023</xref>). This research posits that despite these additional variables, a positive relationship exists between a well-structured capital framework and financial success.</p>

            <title>2.1. Capital structure and financial performance</title>
          
          <p>The concept of capital structure is interpreted in various ways across the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Wadesango et al., 2022</xref>). As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Brealey et al. (2020)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">Ross et al. (2017)</xref>, capital structure is defined as the specific blend of debt and equity utilized to finance a firm’s operational and production activities. In essence, it is the ratio of long-term debt against equity that influences how a company finances its endeavors, establishing its capital structure. Consequently, the structural correlation of a firm’s capital is generally reflected by its debt and equity proportions. Specifically, a company’s financial performance is significantly affected by its effectiveness in acquiring, employing, and managing capital. Business performance serves as a key economic indicator, showcasing how efficiently inputs are utilized during production. It constitutes a broad economic measure that evaluates the efficiency with which an entity utilizes both its financial and material resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Minnema &amp;amp; Andersson, 2018</xref>). The evaluation of financial performance remains one of the most contentious topics in financial management.</p>

            <title>2.2. Empirical literature review</title>
          
          <p>A significant body of research has investigated the connection between financial leverage and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">Wadesango et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Ali et al. (2020)</xref> indicated that as companies increase financial leverage, their performance tends to decline. The above authors noted a notable negative correlation between financial leverage and performance in heavily leveraged firms located in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. Conversely, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Khatun et al. (2021)</xref>, which exploring financial leverage in the Bangladeshi banking sector, found a significant positive association between leverage and performance metrics such as ROA and ROE, indicating that greater leverage can enhance financial outcomes. However, this study also highlighted a weaker correlation in highly leveraged banks. The results highlight the intricate and diverse nature of the connection between financial leverage and performance, which is affected by various contextual elements such as the type of industry and geographic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Al-Taani, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Research has established a significant relationship between profitability and capital structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">Bajaj et al., 2021</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Keter et al. (2023)</xref> identified a trend where firms with higher leverage ratios exhibited reduced profitability, attributing this to the increased financial risk associated with debt. Businesses were found to be more profitable when relying on equity financing. Similarly, investigations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">Ullah et al. (2020)</xref> in Pakistan’s industrial sector revealed a connection between profitability and the debt-to-equity ratio, suggesting that maintaining an optimal ratio can enhance profitability. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kaur et al. (2022)</xref> reported a positive correlation between capital structure and profitability among Indian manufacturing firms, asserting that a profitable capital structure is essential for firms aiming to enhance financial performance.</p><p>In addition, emerging evidence has begun to explore the interplay between capital structure, liquidity, and solvency. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">Chen et al. (2023)</xref> investigated this relationship within Chinese listed companies and concluded that an increase in leverage ratios resulted in lower liquidity and solvency metrics, thereby establishing a direct relationship between capital structure and these financial parameters. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Salam &amp;amp; Shourkashti (2019)</xref> investigated Malaysian firms and similarly found that higher debt levels correlated with reduced liquidity and solvency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Kaur et al., (2022</xref>) echoed these findings in the context of Indian manufacturing companies, confirming a negative relationship between capital structure and both liquidity and solvency metrics.</p><p>While most studies conclude that the relationship between gearing and profitability is negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Ajibola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">Itan &amp;amp; Chelencia, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Memon &amp;amp; Tahir, 2016</xref>), they indicate that the interplay between equity return rates and levels of debt is significantly inversely related. He argued that empirical evaluations of capital structures’ impact on performance remain insufficient, thereby calling for more focused research in this area.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Abata et al. (2017)</xref> examined companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in South Africa, investigating various influencer ratios, including the total debt in relation to total assets and total equity. They discovered an inverse correlation between debt ratios and performance but highlighted a positive association between the return on equity (ROE) and the total debt-to-equity ratio. Similar investigations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">Mamaro &amp;amp; Legotlo (2020)</xref> observed inconsistency in results regarding how capital structure impacts performance among retail companies listed on the exchange.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">Magomo (2020)</xref> investigated Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sectors, showing a negative correlation between financial performance and capital structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">Jabangwe &amp;amp; Kadenge (2015)</xref> employed semi-annual data from fourteen companies to explore this relationship, concluding a generally weak positive correlation between capital structure and overall performance. They called for further inquiry into the tourism sector to clarify existing inconsistencies in findings.</p>

Descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency distribution, offered insights into the characteristics of the sample and their views. To explore connections between different components of capital structure and measures of financial performance, inferential statistics, including correlation and regression analysis, were employed. Statistical software (e.g., SPSS or Excel) facilitated the analysis of the gathered data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in processing.</p><p>The study’s small sample size of 31 participants and reliance on self-reported data pose limitations that may affect the findings’ generalizability and validity, suggesting a need for future research with larger samples and longitudinal approaches.</p>

Nonetheless, this viewpoint faces criticism from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1958)</xref>, who contend that a company’s profitability is unaffected by its financing methods.</p>

Only 4% of respondents disagreed with this assertion, and none of the respondents strongly disagreed. This may mean that the participants believe Robin Corporation Ltd.’s level of financial leverage impairs the ability of the company to meet its long-term financial obligations. Most researchers have found that financial leverage may potentially raise the company’s risk of bankruptcy or insolvency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Acharya &amp;amp; Pedersen (2019)</xref> also support this opinion, saying that, when a company uses debt financing, it may end up taking on greater risk than it would if it used only equity financing.</p>

Their findings show that firms with elevated debt-to-equity ratios generally exhibit lower levels of liquidity.

      <p>The findings from the regression analysis provide insights into how the capital structure of Robin Corporation Ltd relates to its financial performance, as gauged by ROE. This analysis reveals that the intercept coefficient is 0.051, suggesting that even when both the debt-to-equity ratio and EBITDA margin are at zero, the predicted ROE will still be approximately 5.1%. The statistical significance of this intercept is confirmed by a p-value of 0.020, indicating that it is significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. This implies that factors other than the capital structure still contribute positively to the firm’s ROE.</p><p>The coefficient for the debt-to-equity ratio is reported at 0.035, accompanied by a standard error of 0.007. With a t-statistic of 5.000 and a p-value of 0.001, the results indicate a robust and statistically meaningful association between the debt-to-equity ratio and ROE. Specifically, this implies that a one-unit rise in the debt-to-equity ratio is associated with an increase in ROE by 0.035 units, suggesting that Robin Corporation Ltd successfully utilizes debt to boost returns for its shareholders. This finding aligns with the established finance literature, which posits that an optimal level of debt can amplify profits through financial leverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">Brealey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller, 1958</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the EBITDA margin exhibits a coefficient of 0.092, with a standard error of 0.029, a t-statistic of 3.17, and a p-value of 0.008. This indicates a statistically significant positive effect on ROE. In practical terms, this means that for every unit increase in the EBITDA margin, ROE increases by 0.092 units. These results highlight a strong operational capacity and efficiency in generating profits, thereby enhancing financial performance. This finding is consistent with prior research, which suggests that higher profitability from core operations directly boosts shareholder value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Graham et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The robustness of the model is evidenced by an adjusted R-squared value of 0.701 and a primary R-squared value of 0.745, suggesting that around 74.5% of the variation in ROE can be accounted for by the independent variables used. Furthermore, with an F-statistic of 17.019 and a highly significant p-value of 0.0001, the overall model is confirmed to be statistically significant. These results show that both the debt-to-equity ratio and EBITDA margin serve as meaningful predictors of ROE.</p><p>These findings not only contribute valuable insights into the capital structure dynamics of the company but are also in line with prevailing theories in corporate finance surrounding the advantages of leveraging debt and enhancing operational efficiency.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The findings align largely with existing literature, revealing that respondents overwhelmingly agree that financial leverage impacts profitability (81%), liquidity (96%), and solvency (81%) of the firm. Nonetheless, there exists a connection between the debt-to-equity ratio and profitability that was found to be more complex, with significant skepticism among respondents regarding a direct correlation, highlighting a nuanced understanding of financial structures within the corporation. Furthermore, a considerable majority (69%) believe that higher debt-to-equity ratios lead to lower liquidity, emphasizing the risks associated with increased debt financing.</p><p>The results carry significant implications for both theoretical frameworks and practical applications. Theoretically, they reinforce established perspectives on how capital structure influences corporate performance while also shedding light on inconsistencies identified by researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Modigliani &amp;amp; Miller (1958)</xref>. Their seminal work posited that financing choices do not impact a firm’s profitability. Practically, these insights suggest that Robin Corporation Ltd should strive to maintain an optimal debt-to-equity ratio, balancing risk and return while ensuring profitability and liquidity. Specifically, the corporation might consider adopting a conservative borrowing strategy to enhance financial stability, enabling sustained growth without excessively burdening cash flow.</p><p>To further enhance capital structure decision-making, Robin Corporation Ltd should engage in regular financial assessments to align its debt policies with operational objectives. This could include scenario planning to understand the impacts of various levels of debt on profitability, liquidity, and solvency under different economic conditions. Additionally, the findings of this study can serve as a benchmark for similar industries facing comparable economic environments. Other companies might explore these insights when considering their capital structures, aiming to balance financial leverage with strategic operational needs. Ultimately, diligent management of capital structure will assist Robin Corporation Ltd in achieving long-term organizational success and resilience against economic fluctuations.</p>
