      <abstract><p>Increasing energy requirements in hot regions highlight the need for sustainable thermal management technologies. A promising passive cooling solution is Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) that use the relatively stable temperature of the subsurface soil to pre-cool air supplied to indoor spaces. This study investigates the thermal and hydraulic performance of an EAHE coupled to a greenhouse in severe summer conditions in Nasiriyah city, southern Iraq, experimentally. The system was designed to evaluate its effectiveness in moderating ambient temperature extremes and reducing mechanical cooling energy requirements. Experimental results during July–October showed that the EAHE outlet air temperature stayed between 31 and 38°C despite ambient temperature exceeding 50°C, indicating a stable thermal response of the buried exchanger. The greenhouse air temperature was maintained at 34–40°C during peak daytime hours and decreased to about 29–33°C during the remaining operating periods, confirming improved internal thermal conditions. The thermal effectiveness ($\varepsilon$) ranged from 0.68 to 0.75, and the average temperature drop ($\Delta{T}$) was above 13°C throughout the test period. Furthermore, pressure drop and fan power increased with airflow velocity, consistent with a turbulent flow regime. The EAHE delivered 2011–2942 W of cooling with 42–144 W of fan power; an indicative baseline from a comparable 50 Hz mini-split (8500–11000 Btu/h) shows a rated electrical input of ~880–1070 W, highlighting the low electrical demand of the EAHE fan (catalog-based context, not a side-by-side test). In summary, the EAHE–greenhouse system demonstrates a viable, energy-efficient pilot-scale option for passive cooling in hot climates, with potential for agricultural applications subject to site-specific sizing and installation constraints.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Due to the increasing demand for energy in hot regions and the requirement for sustainable cooling technologies, Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) systems represent a viable passive approach for saving energy on air-conditioning systems, mainly in greenhouses. These systems take advantage of the relatively constant temperature at 3–4 meters depth to pre-condition incoming air before delivery into spaces. Through this approach, the dependency on active air-conditioning systems can be reduced substantially, which can improve indoor thermal comfort. The utilization of thermal techniques in agriculture and other sectors has increased in parallel with the global trend toward adopting energy-efficient and sustainable technologies for thermal management.</p><p>Analyzing the performance of the Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger is challenging due to the numerous related aspects that require in-depth investigation, such as the heat transfer rate, overall thermal efficiency, pressure losses, long-term operating reliability, and economic feasibility. As the demand for EAHE systems increases, many studies have been conducted to evaluate their performance under various climatic conditions, configurations, and operational scenarios.</p><p>Across the EAHE literature, performance is consistently governed by a small set of coupled design and operating factors: (i) airflow rate/velocity, (ii) pipe geometry and layout (diameter, length, and pipe arrangement), and (iii) soil thermal conditions and properties. These factors jointly determine a key engineering trade-off: higher airflow can increase delivered cooling capacity but usually at the cost of higher-pressure losses and fan energy, while longer/deeper or better-coupled pipes improve thermal exchange with diminishing returns.</p><p>From the hydraulic point of view, there are many investigations that have shown that the geometry highly affects the pressure-loss features. Amanowicz and Wojtkowiak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] conducted a study on the non-uniformity of air flow in EAHE U- and Z-type multi-pipe EAHE systems in which they found that simple geometry modifications could allow for nearly 9% improvement in both flow uniformity and heat transfer without any additional costs. They also showed in a series of subsequent works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] that manifold design and configuration could lead to large differences between airflow allocations-varying up to five times for parallel pipes due to the unfavorable static pressure distribution along the length of the exchanger. Amanowicz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with 1:4 scale experiments and demonstrated that a switch from Z to U supply arrangement led to the reduction in overall pressure losses by between 6%–36%, respectively, while increasing airflow uniformity by 80%.</p><p>These studies highlight that layout and manifold choices are not minor details: they directly control flow maldistribution and pressure losses, and therefore influence the net energy benefit once fan power is considered.</p><p>The thermal performance has been analyzed under varied environments and conditions of operation. Ahmed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] studied a grid Earth-to-Air Heat Exchanger in the hot, humid Australian climate. In their work the dimensions of the PVC pipe were 0.02 m in diameter and 7.5 m long. The average temperature drop was 4.11°C, proving the influence of pipe diameter, pipe length, and flow rate. Sakhri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] presented experimental research in a desert area of Southwest Algeria with an increase in temperature of 13°C during heating and a decrease of 7°C when cooling, as well as considerable local climatic-condition effects. Ahmad and Prakash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] experimented on the EAHE system with PVC pipes of three diameters in the range of 0.0285–0.0485 m, and the inlet airflow velocity is in the range of 2 to 6.5 m/s. They reported that a higher temperature difference <inline-formula>

    <mml:mrow>
      <mml:mi>T</mml:mi>
    </mml:mrow>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> occurs for smaller diameters, whereas an increase of inlet velocity resulted in a slight reduction from the heating or cooling profile within the matrix heat exchanger. They also found that EAHE effectiveness (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mafg0vxka4">
    <mml:mi>ε</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>) decreases with velocity and is lower for larger diameters; however, heating/cooling capacity increases with inlet velocity.</p><p>Overall, experimental results across climates consistently show that the thermal response depends strongly on airflow rate and pipe sizing, while the achievable temperature change is highly site-dependent (ambient conditions and soil coupling). This makes greenhouse applications in hot regions particularly sensitive to both thermal performance and ventilation demand.</p><p>Numerical and modeling approaches have commonly been applied to estimate the performance of EAHE under various operating conditions. A performance evaluation is given for a system, focusing on the pipe material and thickness variations described by Hasan and Noori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. According to their study, the use of PVC is advantageous from both the economic and the anticorrosion points of view, while also highlighting the effects of varying air conditions. Hasan and Noori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] studied single-layer and double-layer buried EAHE systems based on the analysis used for predicting annual energy saving rates, where a considerable decrease in annual energy consumption is achieved when a double layer of an EAHE is used. Mohammed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>] developed a MATLAB/Simulink model to simulate various configurations. They concluded that multi dividual pipes worked not only better for cooling but also for the pressure-loss reduction. Hasan and Eman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] studied the effect of the disturbed soil thickness around the pipes on the stable wall at low wind speed and the disturbed layer thickness in the range of 1d to 6d using a CFD for Nasiriya city, Iraq.</p><p>Collectively, the modeling studies highlight that material and configuration (single or multi-pipe, single versus multiple courses) and the behavior of soil–pipe thermal interaction assumed could bias predicted performance; however, practical benefits depend on how well models capture real soil conditions and pressure-loss penalties.</p><p>Recent peer-reviewed research in the 2023–2025 period has strengthened even further the empirical underpinning of EAHE systems and provided specific design recommendations for hot, arid regions as well as for greenhouses. Notably, Hegazy and Mohamed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] introduced a remote-sensing-driven screening framework for Egypt’s New Delta and highlighted that ground temperatures at roughly 4 m depth can exhibit only modest fluctuations. This result further justifies the selection of installation depths in this range—particularly in arid, data-scarce environments where remote sensing can offer useful large-area guidance for substantively guiding siting and design decisions. In a similar vein, Sakhri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>] studied the thermal and economic analysis of the EAHE applied to an indoor climate conditioning system during winter in arid regions as a low-CO<inline-formula>

</inline-formula> conditioning technique. For CEA, Nauta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>] integrated an EAHE in a commercial greenhouse energy model and demonstrated that key design choices—most importantly the depth of burial and fan operation conditions—are mainly responsible for large-scale energy efficiency outcomes. Finally, Sofyan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] simulated CFD to compare between series and parallel configurations, based on which it was suggested that selection of the configuration does not only take care of thermal gains but also takes into account the penalty due to pressure loss.</p><p>In conclusion, previous studies have significantly improved the insight on EAHE systems and their design parameters. However, the experimental research into the thermal and hydraulic performance of EAHEs in practical greenhouses is relatively limited. In particular, fewer studies jointly report the EAHE outlet air temperature delivered to the greenhouse and the associated pressure losses/fan energy under repeatable operating conditions, which is essential for assessing the net benefit in hot climates.</p><p>This study examined the thermal performance and energy efficiency of an EAHE system within a greenhouse, providing a practical environment to evaluate its effectiveness in hot climate regions. The results enhance passive cooling techniques in thermal systems engineering and demonstrate the effectiveness of EAHE systems for energy-efficient greenhouse air conditioning in elevated temperatures.</p><p>To synthesize the governing trends reported across EAHE studies, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the main design/operational factors and their reported effects.</p>

          <p>This paper investigated the thermal and hydraulic performance of an EAHE system designed in a U-type configuration. The exchanger consisted of six parallel, side-by-side PVC pipes. Each pipe was 6.93 m long, with a total pipe length of 53 m. The manifold and branch pipe diameters were 0.1016 m. The system was installed at a depth of 3.5 m, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

          <p>This study primarily comprised an experimental field investigation conducted under the climatic conditions of Nasiriyah (Southern Iraq) to quantify the thermal and hydraulic performance of a U-type EAHE. To support the experimental analysis, a CFD model was developed in ANSYS 2024 to verify the physical consistency of the measured trends and to examine flow distribution and pressure-loss characteristics that are not easily accessible through measurements alone. Based on the experimental dataset, the system was evaluated using key performance indicators, including total pressure drop, fan power demand, thermal effectiveness, heat transfer rate, and an overall performance factor. This set of metrics enabled a comprehensive assessment of EAHE performance.</p>

          <p>A small greenhouse was built for the experimental site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>e) so that measurements were conducted under real operating conditions. A variable-speed fan was installed at the outlet section to circulate air through the EAHE system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. System temperature was recorded using fourteen K-type thermocouples. Two sensors were installed at the air intake and exhaust of the heat exchanger, and two additional sensors were installed in the middle of the greenhouse interior. One thermocouple was used to measure ambient air temperature. The remaining sensors were vertically installed in a PVC pipe to measure soil temperature at different depths up to 3.5 m, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

              <p>Although the governing equations are standard, the novelty of this work lies in the validated 3D conjugate heat-transfer CFD model developed for a multi-pipe U-type EAHE under representative hot-climate boundary conditions. The underlying fluid-flow and heat-transfer equations follow the standard formulations reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. </p><p><inline-formula>

To simplify the numerical model, the short near-surface vertical inlet/outlet sections were treated as thermally insulated. Because these segments are short and temperature changes occur in opposite directions (cooling in the inlet leg and warming in the outlet leg), their net influence on the outlet temperature is expected to be small compared with the horizontal buried pipe at 3.5 m depth, where soil temperature is relatively stable. This treatment is consistent with common practice in EAHE simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]; however, it remains a simplification that may introduce a small bias.</p>

              <p>where, $n$ is the number of 30-min samples collected over 72 h for each velocity. For context, published EAHE validation studies report deviations ranging from about 3%–4% in controlled tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] to 7.46% under transient operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. In tunnel-scale studies, deviations have reached up to 11.70% for outlet temperature, while the maximum difference in total pressure drop was about 14% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. In addition, comparisons against the dataset of Hegazy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] show temperature-drop differences of 2.4%–14.8%, depending on velocity and modeling assumptions. The remaining underprediction in the present work was most likely due to simplifying assumptions (e.g., constant thermophysical properties and simplified treatment of the vertical inlet/outlet sections).</p>
              <p>To complement the graphical validation, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref> summarizes the agreement between CFD predictions and experimental measurements across the four tested inlet velocities. The comparison focuses on outlet air temperature and total pressure drop, which directly govern cooling performance and fan-power demand.</p>

              <p>The CFD model was based on steady-state operation, homogeneous soil conditions, and constant thermophysical properties. In practice, soil temperature and moisture can vary with depth, location, and time, and the soil adjacent to the pipe can gradually warm during prolonged operation. Neglecting these effects can make the model overly idealized and can lead to biased heat-exchange predictions. In the present case, the simplifying assumptions contributed to systematically lower predicted outlet temperatures (<inline-formula>

    </mml:msub>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>) than those measured.</p><p>Treating the short near-surface vertical inlet/outlet segments as thermally insulated was another simplifying assumption. A refined treatment that accounts for near-surface thermal interaction could be examined in future work. In addition, the underprediction of total pressure drop (<inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m40f8t7di1">
    <mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi>
    <mml:mi>P</mml:mi>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula>) may be partly attributable to simplified representations of wall roughness and minor losses in the manifold and branch junctions. Incorporating transient behavior, moisture- and depth-dependent soil properties, and a more detailed treatment of distributed and local losses would likely reduce these discrepancies.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_16">Figure 16</xref> shows the fan power as a function of airflow velocity. For velocities between 11 and 17 m/s, fan power increases strongly from about 42 W to nearly 145 W (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>), showing an approximately cubic dependence on velocity. At higher velocities, increased frictional and dynamic losses in the buried pipes lead to higher energy consumption. This behavior emphasizes the need to select moderate inlet airflow rates to achieve effective cooling while maintaining energy savings.</p>

</inline-formula>* decreases from 47.4 at 11 m/s to 20.4 at 17 m/s because fan power increases much faster than EAHE cooling capacity. Although EAHE heat transfer increases with airflow velocity, fan power increases approximately with the cube of velocity, which reduces overall performance. This behavior indicates a clear thermal–hydraulic trade-off: higher velocity enhances cooling, but it incurs substantial energy penalties. Therefore, the 13–15 m/s range provides a practical balance between cooling performance and electrical demand.</p>

The flow fraction decreases from Pipe 1 (25.1%) to Pipe 6 (9.3%), indicating progressive redistribution across branches rather than concentration in a single pipe. The higher share in the first pipes is likely associated with higher available driving pressure near the inlet manifold, while the progressive decline is consistent with the pressure gradient along the manifold as flow is successively extracted by downstream branches. Overall, airflow is distributed across all pipes, with upstream branches carrying a larger share, consistent with the static-pressure field shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_18">Figure 18</xref>.</p>

            <title>3.5. Scalability and engineering constraints</title>
          
          <p>This work demonstrates EAHE performance at pilot scale using a buried multi-pipe configuration (total buried length and depth as reported in Section 2). Scaling to larger agricultural greenhouses is feasible but remains design specific. Increasing pipe length (i.e., heat-transfer area) can improve thermal performance, but it typically increases pressure drop and fan-energy demand, requiring an explicit thermal–hydraulic trade-off. In multi-pipe systems, manifold design and overall geometry also influence airflow distribution uniformity and total pressure losses and should therefore be considered during scale-up.</p><p>Practical constraints include excavation area and burial depth, pipe spacing, maintenance access, and available electrical power for fans. Accordingly, the present results should be interpreted as a validated pilot-scale reference and a basis for engineering sizing, rather than a universal guarantee for all agricultural deployments.</p>

          <p>The EAHE provided 2011–2942 W of cooling, while the fan electrical demand was 42–144 W. To contextualize potential energy savings, manufacturer specification sheets for 50 Hz mini-split units in a comparable capacity class (8500–11000 Btu/h <inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mwjfrxdm7a">
    <mml:mo>≈</mml:mo>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> 2491–3224 W) were used; this report rated cooling electrical inputs of approximately 880–1070 W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_20">Figure 20</xref>). Therefore, for a similar order of cooling duty, the EAHE fan power corresponds to roughly 4%–16% of the electrical input of conventional vapor-compression cooling (indicative baseline). This comparison is provided for context because catalog ratings are reported under standardized conditions, and a direct side-by-side greenhouse test was not performed.</p>
