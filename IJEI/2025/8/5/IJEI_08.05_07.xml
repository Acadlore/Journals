      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Water scarcity is increasingly recognized as a critical global issue that poses significant challenges to human health, food security, and economic development. As the global population continues to rise, currently exceeding 7.9 billion, the demand for freshwater resources is reaching unprecedented levels. The United Nations estimates that approximately 2 billion people live in water-stressed regions, a figure expected to escalate due to climate change and unsustainable water management practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Climate change exacerbates the situation by altering precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, and intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, which collectively threaten the availability and quality of freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite the extensive research on water scarcity and its implications, a notable research gap exists regarding the application of remote sensing technologies for a comprehensive assessment of freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. While numerous studies have explored the impacts of climate change on water availability, few have systematically integrated remote sensing data to evaluate these changes on a global scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Remote sensing offers a unique advantage by providing timely and accurate information on water bodies, land use, and climatic conditions, enabling researchers and policymakers to monitor and manage water resources more effectively. This gap highlights the urgency of developing innovative methodologies that leverage advanced technologies to address the complexities of water scarcity in the context of climate change.</p><p>Prior research has established a clear link between climate change and its detrimental effects on freshwater availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Studies have shown that alterations in precipitation patterns can lead to both droughts and floods, affecting the replenishment of aquifers and surface water bodies. Furthermore, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, further complicates the management of water resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. However, while these studies provide valuable insights, they often lack a comprehensive approach that incorporates the spatial and temporal dimensions of water scarcity, which remote sensing can effectively address [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>].</p><p>The novelty of this study lies in its focus on utilizing remote sensing as a primary tool for evaluating the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. By synthesizing existing literature and employing advanced remote sensing techniques, this research aims to provide a clearer understanding of how climate change affects freshwater availability on a global scale. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of assessments but also facilitates the identification of vulnerable regions that are most at risk of experiencing water scarcity.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to conduct a global water scarcity assessment through remote sensing evaluations, identifying regions at risk and potential future scenarios under varying climate conditions. Specifically, the research seeks to quantify changes in freshwater availability, assess the implications for agricultural and urban water use, and evaluate the effectiveness of current water management strategies. By integrating remote sensing data with climate models, this study aims to offer a comprehensive analysis that informs sustainable water resource management practices.</p><p>The findings of this research hold significant implications for policymakers, water resource managers, and stakeholders involved in water governance. By providing practical insights into the current state of freshwater resources and the projected impacts of climate change, this study aims to enhance resilience and promote adaptive measures to address the pressing challenges of water scarcity globally. Ultimately, this research contributes to the academic discourse on water management and offers a framework for utilizing technology to develop effective strategies for ensuring sustainable access to freshwater resources in an era of increasing uncertainty.</p>

      <title>3. Result and discussion</title>
      <p>In this section, we present the findings and discussions derived from the comprehensive literature review conducted on global water scarcity and the application of remote sensing technologies in evaluating the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The analysis reveals a complex interplay between climate change, water availability, and the efficacy of remote sensing as a tool for monitoring and managing freshwater resources. The literature indicates that climate change significantly influences the hydrological cycle, leading to alterations in precipitation patterns, increased evaporation rates, and more frequent extreme weather events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. These changes directly affect freshwater availability, particularly in regions already experiencing water stress. For instance, studies have shown that areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia are becoming increasingly vulnerable to drought conditions, which not only diminish surface water supplies but also threaten groundwater recharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. The resulting water scarcity has profound implications for agricultural productivity, food security, and overall human health. The analysis highlights that the impacts of climate change are not uniform; rather, they vary significantly across different geographic regions and socio-economic contexts. This variability underscores the need for localized assessments that consider specific climatic and hydrological conditions when evaluating water resources.</p><p>Remote sensing technologies have emerged as vital tools in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and water scarcity. The literature reviewed demonstrates the effectiveness of satellite-based observations in monitoring water bodies, assessing land use changes, and evaluating the impacts of climatic variations on freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. For example, remote sensing allows for the continuous observation of changes in surface water extent, enabling researchers to detect trends over time and identify areas at risk of depletion. Furthermore, remote sensing data can be integrated with climate models to predict future water availability scenarios under various climate change projections. This capability is particularly important for informing water management strategies and policy decisions aimed at mitigating the impacts of water scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>The analysis also reveals that while remote sensing technologies offer significant advantages, there are limitations that must be acknowledged. Issues such as data resolution, cloud cover interference, and the need for ground-truthing can affect the accuracy of remote sensing assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Moreover, the integration of remote sensing data with socio-economic indicators is often lacking, which can hinder a comprehensive understanding of water scarcity dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Addressing these limitations is essential for enhancing the reliability of remote sensing as a tool for water resource management. Additionally, the review highlights several case studies that exemplify successful applications of remote sensing in managing freshwater resources. For instance, in regions like California, remote sensing has been utilized to monitor snowpack levels, which are critical for water supply during the dry summer months. By providing timely and accurate data, remote sensing has enabled water managers to make informed decisions regarding water allocation and conservation efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Similarly, in parts of India, satellite imagery has been employed to assess groundwater depletion, facilitating targeted interventions to improve water use efficiency in agriculture.</p><p>The discussion also points to the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine remote sensing with local knowledge and community engagement. Effective water management requires not only technological advancements but also an understanding of the socio-cultural dimensions of water use. Engaging local communities in monitoring efforts can enhance the relevance and applicability of remote sensing data, ensuring that management strategies are aligned with the needs and practices of those most affected by water scarcity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p>The findings from this literature review underscore the critical role of remote sensing technologies in assessing and managing freshwater resources in the context of climate change. While significant progress has been made in utilizing these technologies, ongoing challenges and limitations must be addressed to fully realize their potential. The integration of remote sensing data with local knowledge and socio-economic factors will be essential for developing effective and sustainable water management strategies. As global water scarcity continues to escalate, the insights gained from this analysis will contribute to the development of adaptive measures that enhance resilience and ensure the sustainable use of freshwater resources for future generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p><p>Water scarcity in island regions is one of the most pressing challenges in the face of climate change and global population growth. Island areas often experience limited freshwater resources due to geographic constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and increasing seawater intrusion into aquifers caused by rising sea levels. Shifts in rainfall patterns and rising global temperatures further exacerbate the situation, leading to a decline in freshwater availability for both human consumption and local ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p><p>Remote sensing technology has proven to be an effective tool for monitoring changes in water resources within island regions. By utilizing satellite imagery, scientists can analyze soil moisture variations, evapotranspiration levels, and groundwater dynamics to assess the vulnerability of freshwater supplies. Remote sensing-based evaluations also enable early detection of groundwater depletion trends, river flow alterations, and the increasing frequency of droughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the context of climate change, this research highlights how rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns affect the hydrological cycle in island regions. A better understanding of water limitations in these areas is crucial for developing adaptive policies, water conservation strategies, and implementing desalination and water recycling technologies to ensure sustainable water supply. By leveraging remote sensing techniques, this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of water scarcity in island regions and propose effective solutions for future water resource management and mitigation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>].</p><p>The key factors affecting water availability in island regions include:</p><p>• Changes in Rainfall Patterns - Small islands heavily rely on rainfall for drinking water and agriculture. However, climate change has led to unpredictable rainfall patterns, with longer dry seasons and more erratic precipitation. This imbalance disrupts water storage and accessibility throughout the year.</p><p>• Seawater Intrusion – Rising sea levels caused by global warming have increased seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers, contaminating groundwater supplies with saltwater. This makes groundwater unsafe for consumption and unsuitable for agricultural irrigation.</p><p>• Population Growth and Water Demand – Many island regions experience rapid population growth and booming tourism industries, leading to increased water demand that often exceeds the island’s natural capacity to supply water sustainably.</p><p>• Lack of Water Storage and Management Infrastructure – Many islands lack adequate water infrastructure, such as reservoirs, filtration systems, and desalination facilities. Dependence on shallow wells and limited rainwater harvesting systems makes these areas highly vulnerable to droughts.</p><p>• Pollution and Contamination of Water Sources – Human activities, including domestic and industrial waste, have significantly contributed to water pollution. This contamination worsens freshwater scarcity, limiting the availability of safe drinking water without costly treatment processes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> shows a map depicting the water use index of Maluku Island. This map provides information about the distribution and level of water resource utilization across various regions of the island. The index measures the extent to which water is used in economic, social, and household activities in each area, highlighting the imbalance between water availability and water demand in these regions.</p>

      <p>Through this map, we can observe areas with both high and low water use levels, which reflect differing water consumption patterns across regions. Areas with higher water use indices indicate greater demand for water, whether for agriculture, industry, or meeting basic community needs. Conversely, areas with lower indices may face limitations in water access or use, which could impact the quality of life of the local population.</p><p>The analysis of river basins in Maluku Island for the existing year 2010 reveals that one river basin, namely the Halmahera Utara Watershed (WS), falls into the “mildly critical” category, regardless of the presence or absence of maintenance flows. This classification indicates a relatively low level of vulnerability in terms of water resource sustainability. However, it highlights the need for proactive measures to prevent further degradation and ensure sustainable management of this watershed. The criticality assessment underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and intervention strategies to maintain ecological balance and water availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>The per capita water availability index for all watersheds on Maluku Island demonstrates that these regions are in a state of “no stress”, with no water deficits reported. This indicates that the water resources in these watersheds are currently sufficient to meet the needs of the population. The absence of water stress reflects effective natural resource conditions and possibly adequate rainfall distribution across the island. Nevertheless, this favorable condition should not lead to complacency, as future changes in climate patterns or population growth could alter this balance.</p><p>The findings emphasize the importance of sustainable watershed management practices to preserve current conditions and address areas with mild criticality. Integrating conservation efforts, such as reforestation, soil stabilization, and community-based water management programs, can enhance resilience against potential threats. Additionally, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, including local governments, communities, and environmental organizations, is essential to ensure long-term sustainability. By maintaining a focus on proactive measures and adaptive management strategies, Maluku Island can safeguard its water resources for future generations while supporting ecological and socio-economic stability.</p><p>To address water scarcity in island regions, remote sensing technology has become an invaluable tool for monitoring changes in water resources in real time. Using satellite imagery and ground-based sensors, scientists can analyze soil moisture variations, evapotranspiration levels, groundwater fluctuations, and precipitation distribution over time. Remote sensing evaluation allows for early detection of groundwater depletion, shifts in river flows, and the increasing frequency of droughts affecting island communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, these technologies enable researchers to track coastline changes due to sea-level rise, which directly affects freshwater availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. By integrating data from multiple satellite systems, including Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS, researchers can pinpoint areas most vulnerable to water crises, enabling governments and stakeholders to implement timely and targeted mitigation measures.</p><p>In the context of climate change, this research highlights how rising global temperatures and changing rainfall patterns impact the hydrological cycle in island regions. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of water limitations in these areas is crucial for developing adaptation policies, water conservation strategies, and the implementation of desalination and water recycling technologies.</p><p>By utilizing remote sensing approaches, this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of water scarcity in island regions, along with policy and technological recommendations for mitigating the impacts of climate change on freshwater resources. These insights will be invaluable for policy planning, environmental management, and community adaptation efforts, ensuring long-term water security in island regions worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>].</p><p>Water resilience of the Riau Archipelago Province is experiencing economic growth, population increase, urbanization, and water pollution, which significantly heightens the demand for clean water. Highly urbanized cities such as Batam, Tanjungpinang, Bintan, and Karimun require special strategies to meet domestic, urban, and industrial water needs.</p><p>Industrial areas like Muka Kuning, Batu Aji, and Galang in Batam, as well as Lobam in Bintan, face similar challenges, as do the tourism areas in Anambas, Batam, and Bintan, which require a stable water supply. Water resilience is a critical issue because inadequate availability could disrupt economic growth and regional development. The goal for water supply provision in the Riau Islands aligns with SDG 6, targeting the fulfillment of drinking water needs by 2030, while as of 2015, the coverage of drinking water provision was only 50.35%.</p><p>In Batam Island, as of 2017, clean water services only reached the mainland, while hinterland areas still struggled with access to water. The regional water company (PDAM) in Tanjungpinang and Bintan could not meet the growing demand, especially in supporting the Free Trade Zone. Daik and Dabo in Lingga Regency also require an increased water supply to preserve their heritage identity and support the agricultural and tourism sectors.</p><p>In Tarempa, residents draw water directly from the mountains using plastic pipes, while on Palmatak Island, the community relies on shallow groundwater wells with electric pumps. The difficulties in accessing clean water in various regions highlight the need for government intervention to improve access and sustainable water infrastructure.</p><p>Food Resilience Most food supplies, particularly rice, are still imported from outside the Riau Archipelago Province. Irrigated rice fields exist only on three islands, covering a total area of 1,726 hectares, spread across the Anambas Islands (Jemaja 386 ha), Karimun (278 ha), and Natuna (1,062 ha in six irrigation areas).</p><p>The average annual rice production (2010-2016) reached 1,254 tons, yielding 877.8 tons of rice, which only meets 0.24% of the rice needs in the Riau Archipelago. To increase production, efforts are being made to expand new rice fields and irrigation systems, which depend on the availability of water supply. Currently, the construction of the Kelarik Reservoir, Tapau Dam, and Jemaja Dam is underway. Water balance is an essential factor in planning irrigation infrastructure, which can be combined with raw water supply for domestic, urban, and industrial needs to support food resilience and regional development.</p>

The color scheme used indicates varying percentages of water across different islands, providing clear insight into how water resources are distributed across this region. The map visually demonstrates areas with varying levels of water availability, assisting in the understanding of geographical and environmental factors that influence water management in the archipelago.</p>

      <p>Energy Resilience A critical requirement for regional development is the availability of sufficient energy. At the beginning of 2017, electricity production to supply the energy needs of the Riau Archipelago Province was entirely generated from Diesel Power Plants (PLTD) in several locations, relying on fossil fuels, as well as Steam Power Plants (PLTU). The electricity demand was 104.78 Megawatts, supplied by PLTU with 14 Megawatts, PLTD with 90.58 Megawatts, and Solar Power Plants (PLTS) with 0.2 Megawatts.</p><p>Regarding water resource management, energy can be generated from hydropower. Locations suitable for the construction of Micro-Hydro Power Plants (PLTMH) are found on islands with adequate surface flows and steep topography, such as Siantan and Palmatak Islands (Anambas Islands Regency), Lingga and Singkep Islands (Lingga Regency), and Bunguran Island (Natuna Regency).</p><p>Global Climate Change Global warming leads to climate change and increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global warming could cause significant changes in physical and biological systems. The resulting changes include increased intensity of tropical storms, shifts in precipitation patterns, sea water salinity, changes in wind patterns, impacts on the reproductive periods of animals and plants, species distribution and population sizes, frequency of pest outbreaks and disease epidemics, as well as effects on ecosystems in high latitude regions (including ecosystems in the Arctic and Antarctic regions).</p><p>Based on analysis conducted by the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in 2008, over the long term (1900-2010), the average temperature increase in Indonesia was approximately 0.002℃ per year, while over the past 50 years (1965-2009), the temperature increased more rapidly, at 0.016℃ per year. The trend of rising sea levels in Indonesia can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that global warming will contribute to the rise in sea levels. Based on the combination of data from several satellites (Multi-mission Satellites), the rate of sea level rise in Indonesia ranges from 0 to 9 mm per year. Meanwhile, the ICCSR study shows that during the period from 2001 to 2008, the average sea level rise in Indonesia was 6 cm, with variations ranging between 2 and 12 cm. The IPCC predicts that sea levels may rise by 18 cm to 59 cm by the year 2100. This will certainly impact Indonesia’s waters, with the effects being more pronounced in archipelagic regions such as the Riau Archipelago.</p>

            <title>3.1. Impact of climate change on precipitation patterns</title>
          
          <p>The analysis reveals that climate change has led to significant alterations in global precipitation patterns, which directly impact freshwater availability. Numerous studies indicate that while some regions experience increased rainfall, others are subjected to prolonged droughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. For instance, the IPCC reports indicate that areas such as the Sahel region in Africa are facing more erratic rainfall, leading to severe drought conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. This variability not only affects surface water supplies but also groundwater recharge, exacerbating existing water scarcity issues.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref> shows a map illustrating the trend of sea level rise in Indonesia during the period from 1993 to 2011, derived from satellite altimetry data. The map uses a color scale from yellow to red, where yellow indicates areas with low sea level rise (between 0-2 mm/year), and red indicates areas with high sea level rise (over 10 mm/year).</p>

          <p>• This map covers the entire Indonesian region, focusing on key points that show sea level changes, such as Sibalga, Enggano, Tanjung Lesung, Jakarta, Surabaya, and Benoa. From the map, it is evident that most coastal areas of Indonesia have experienced sea level rise, with the eastern regions of Indonesia seeing more significant increases compared to the western regions.</p><p>• The sea level rise observed in this map is driven by various factors, including global warming that causes polar ice melt and the thermal expansion of seawater. This rise poses direct impacts on coastal environments, including an increased risk of coastal flooding, beach erosion, and threats to infrastructure and settlements in densely populated coastal areas. Through this map, we can understand the sea level rise trend occurring in Indonesia, which is crucial for natural resource management, coastal city planning, and future climate change mitigation policies.</p><p>Moreover, the literature highlights that changes in precipitation are often accompanied by shifts in seasonal distribution. Regions that traditionally relied on predictable wet and dry seasons are now experiencing irregular rainfall, complicating agricultural planning and water resource management. For example, in South Asia, the monsoon season has become increasingly unpredictable, resulting in both flooding and drought conditions within short time frames. This unpredictability poses significant challenges for farmers who depend on consistent water supplies for crop production.</p><p>Remote sensing technologies have been instrumental in monitoring these changes in precipitation patterns. Satellite data allows for the observation of rainfall distribution over time, providing critical insights into how climate change is reshaping hydrological cycles globally. By analyzing satellite imagery, researchers can identify trends and anomalies in precipitation, which are essential for developing adaptive management strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. The implications of altered precipitation patterns are profound, particularly for regions already facing water stress. The literature indicates that agricultural productivity is directly linked to water availability, and fluctuations in rainfall can lead to crop failures and food insecurity. Furthermore, the socio-economic impacts of these changes can be severe, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods.</p><p>In conclusion, the analysis underscores the urgent need for localized assessments of precipitation changes due to climate change. Understanding the specific impacts on different regions will be crucial for developing targeted interventions that enhance resilience and ensure sustainable water management practices.</p>

            <title>3.2. Groundwater depletion and climate change</title>
          
          <p>Groundwater resources are increasingly under threat due to the combined effects of climate change and human activities. The literature highlights that rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns lead to reduced groundwater recharge rates, exacerbating the depletion of aquifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. In many regions, particularly arid and semi-arid areas, groundwater serves as a critical source of freshwater for drinking and irrigation. As surface water supplies dwindle, reliance on groundwater increases, further straining these vital resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have documented alarming rates of groundwater depletion in regions such as the Central Valley in California and the Indo-Gangetic Plain in India. Remote sensing technologies have played a pivotal role in quantifying these changes, providing valuable data on groundwater levels and trends over time. For instance, satellite-based measurements of land subsidence have been used to infer groundwater extraction rates, highlighting areas where unsustainable practices are prevalent.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the connection between groundwater depletion and the use of remote sensing technology in monitoring and managing water resources. It follows a sequential process to highlight key aspects of this issue:</p><p>• Groundwater Depletion in Key Regions: Studies have shown alarming rates of groundwater depletion in regions like the Central Valley in California and the Indo-Gangetic Plain in India. These areas experience excessive groundwater extraction due to agricultural demands, urban expansion, and industrial use.</p><p>• Affected Regions: Central Valley and Indo-Gangetic Plain: These regions are hotspots for groundwater overuse, leading to severe consequences such as land subsidence, declining water tables, and increased water scarcity. The heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation makes them particularly vulnerable.</p><p>• Remote Sensing for Groundwater Monitoring: Remote sensing technologies, particularly satellite-based methods, have played a crucial role in tracking groundwater depletion. By analyzing changes in land elevation and water storage, scientists can assess groundwater trends over time.</p><p>• Land Subsidence as an Indicator: One of the most significant applications of satellite data is detecting land subsidence—when excessive groundwater extraction causes the land to sink. This phenomenon provides a measurable indicator of unsustainable groundwater use.</p><p>• Identifying Over-Extraction Hotspots: By combining satellite data with hydrological models, researchers can pinpoint areas where groundwater extraction rates are unsustainable. This information helps policymakers implement better water management strategies, enforce regulations, and promote sustainable water use practices.</p>

          <p>The implications of groundwater depletion extend beyond immediate water scarcity. Over-extraction can lead to land subsidence, reduced water quality, and increased salinity, particularly in coastal areas where freshwater aquifers are threatened by saltwater intrusion. These consequences not only impact agricultural productivity but also pose significant risks to public health and ecosystem integrity.</p><p>Furthermore, the literature emphasizes the need for integrated water resource management approaches that consider both surface and groundwater resources. Effective management strategies must address the interconnectedness of these resources, particularly in the context of climate change. Remote sensing technologies can facilitate this integration by providing comprehensive data that informs decision-making processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the analysis highlights the critical importance of addressing groundwater depletion in the context of climate change. By leveraging remote sensing technologies, stakeholders can develop more effective strategies to monitor and manage groundwater resources, ensuring their sustainability for future generations.</p>

          <p>Remote sensing technologies have emerged as powerful tools for monitoring and managing freshwater resources in the face of climate change. The literature indicates that satellite-based observations provide critical data on water bodies, land use changes, and climatic variations, enabling researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding water management. For instance, remote sensing can be used to monitor changes in surface water extent, allowing for the identification of trends in water availability over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p><p>One significant application of remote sensing is in the assessment of water quality. Satellite imagery can be utilized to detect changes in water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll concentration and turbidity, which are essential for understanding the health of aquatic ecosystems. This information is invaluable for managing water resources, particularly in regions where water quality is deteriorating due to pollution and climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, remote sensing technologies facilitate the monitoring of land use changes that impact water resources. By analyzing satellite data, researchers can identify areas experiencing deforestation, urbanization, or agricultural expansion, all of which can influence hydrological cycles. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing sustainable land management practices that protect freshwater resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>The integration of remote sensing data with hydrological models further enhances the ability to predict future water availability scenarios. By combining satellite observations with climate models, stakeholders can assess the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater resources and develop adaptive management strategies accordingly. This proactive approach is essential for addressing the challenges posed by water scarcity in a changing climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the analysis underscores the transformative potential of remote sensing technologies in water resource management.

            <title>3.4. Socio-economic impacts of water scarcity</title>
          
          <p>The socio-economic impacts of water scarcity are profound and multifaceted, affecting millions of people worldwide. The literature reveals that water scarcity can lead to increased competition for resources, resulting in conflicts and social tensions, particularly in regions where water is already scarce. As freshwater resources become increasingly limited, communities may face challenges in accessing clean drinking water, which has direct implications for public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>].</p><p>Agricultural productivity is particularly vulnerable to water scarcity, as farmers depend on consistent water supplies for irrigation. The literature indicates that reduced water availability can lead to crop failures, decreased yields, and increased food prices, ultimately threatening food security. Vulnerable populations, including smallholder farmers and those living in impoverished conditions, are disproportionately affected by these changes, exacerbating existing inequalities.</p>
          <p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, water scarcity can have significant impacts on various aspects of life, especially in the agricultural sector. Limited water availability hampers crop growth and reduces yields, affecting farmers who rely on rain-fed agriculture. The shortage of water also restricts irrigation supply, making farming less sustainable, particularly for smallholder farmers with limited resources. Prolonged droughts can lead to total crop failures, threatening the livelihoods of rural communities dependent on farming. Decreased crop yields result in higher food prices due to lower supply, directly impacting low-income consumers and urban populations. Food security becomes threatened, particularly for impoverished populations and developing regions, who struggle to access adequate nutrition. The economic impact of water scarcity causes financial losses for farmers, reducing their ability to invest in future farming activities. Social inequality worsens as vulnerable communities, such as subsistence farmers and marginalized groups, bear the brunt of this crisis.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, the economic impacts of water scarcity extend beyond agriculture. Industries reliant on water, such as manufacturing and energy production, may face operational challenges as water supplies dwindle. This can lead to job losses, reduced economic growth, and increased poverty levels. The literature highlights that addressing water scarcity is not only an environmental concern but also a critical socio-economic issue that requires urgent attention.</p><p>The integration of remote sensing data into socio-economic assessments can provide valuable insights into the impacts of water scarcity on communities. By analyzing spatial data alongside socio-economic indicators, researchers can identify vulnerable populations and develop targeted interventions that address their specific needs. This approach is essential for ensuring that water management strategies are equitable and inclusive. In summary, the analysis emphasizes the need for a holistic understanding of the socio-economic impacts of water scarcity.
