      <abstract><p>Accurate shipboard waste prediction is essential for MARPOL compliance, yet maritime research has predominantly relied on fleet-wide aggregated models that may obscure vessel-specific patterns. The occurrence of statistical paradoxes in hierarchical maritime data has not been systematically examined. This study provides the first systematic documentation of Simpson’s Paradox in maritime operational environmental data, using shipboard waste generation as a case study. By analyzing engine running hours and waste generation from six Indonesian training ships, we demonstrate the risks of data aggregation in maritime predictive analytics. We compared fleet-wide Generalized Linear Models with individual vessel regression approaches using 66 observations over 11 days. Simpson’s Paradox emerged in Auxiliary Engine data: strong individual-level correlations ($r$ = 0.993) were masked by weak fleet-wide correlation ($r$ = 0.416), demonstrating how aggregation can fundamentally misrepresent underlying relationships. Individual ship models achieved substantially higher predictive performance (97.38% and 98.60%) than fleet-wide models (89.5% and 17.3%), with cross-validation (CV) confirming robustness. The findings reveal that fleet-wide aggregation can produce misleading predictions with significant operational consequences for waste storage planning and regulatory compliance. This study establishes the necessity of vessel-specific modeling in maritime environmental management and provides methodological guidance for analyzing hierarchical operational data.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The global shipping industry, responsible for transporting over 90% of international trade, is simultaneously a significant contributor to marine pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The operational activities of vessels inevitably generate various types of waste that, if not managed properly, can be discharged into the ocean, leading to severe environmental consequences, including harm to marine ecosystems and microplastic pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. In response, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) established the MARPOL Convention, with Annex V setting stringent regulations for garbage disposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. However, studies examining the effectiveness of these regulations have shown mixed results. Serra-Gonçalves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], for instance, found that after an initial decline following the 2013 ban, shipping-sourced debris on remote beaches began to rise again, suggesting that regulation alone is insufficient without strengthened enforcement and adequate port reception facilities. The latest MARPOL amendments, effective from 2024, further tighten these rules by extending garbage record book requirements, underscoring the increasing pressure on operators for accurate waste tracking and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>For effective compliance and operational planning, the maritime industry increasingly relies on data-driven models to predict vessel performance, from fuel consumption to waste generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. However, despite the critical importance of waste prediction, maritime waste management research has historically relied on qualitative assessments and generic estimation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The absence of quantitative predictive models creates several operational challenges, including suboptimal storage allocation and emergency disposal situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. The engine room, in particular, represents a major source of solid waste on any vessel, especially oil-contaminated materials like rags and gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>Historically, research and practice have relied on fleet-wide aggregated models, which assume that waste generation patterns are largely homogeneous across different vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. This approach, while simpler, carries a significant methodological risk: it is susceptible to aggregation bias, where trends observed in combined data do not reflect the underlying reality within subgroups. The field of transportation research has become increasingly aware of such statistical pitfalls, with recent studies highlighting various forms of bias in maritime data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. A severe form of this is Simpson’s Paradox, a phenomenon where a statistical trend or correlation present within multiple individual groups of data reverses or disappears when those groups are combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>While this paradox is well-documented in social sciences and medicine, its implications for the transport sector are only beginning to be understood. Elvik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>] has recently compiled examples of the paradox in road safety studies, highlighting the potential for misleading conclusions from aggregated transport data. More critically, the paradox has already been identified within the maritime domain itself. Tian and Zhu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] provided a crucial precedent by demonstrating the existence of Simpson’s Paradox in Port State Control (PSC) ship-selection data, finding that aggregated analysis could misrepresent the true risk profile of vessels. Previous studies have investigated factors influencing waste generation, such as operational intensity and crew behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], but were limited to basic correlation analysis without considering hierarchical data structures.</p><p>This raises a critical and unexamined question: If aggregation bias can distort regulatory inspection data, could it also be distorting the operational environmental data used for day-to-day compliance? To date, no study has systematically investigated whether Simpson’s Paradox affects the analysis of shipboard waste generation, a dataset fundamental to MARPOL Annex V compliance. This research gap is a critical blind spot in maritime environmental management. Reliance on flawed fleet-wide models can lead to systematic prediction errors, creating severe operational and regulatory consequences.</p><p>This study addresses this gap by analyzing a unique dataset of engine running hours and solid waste generation from a fleet of six homogenous sister training ships operated by Indonesia’s Human Resources Development Agency in Transportation. Training vessels serve the dual purpose of providing practical education to future seafarers while maintaining high operational standards, playing a crucial role in preparing seafarers for the green shipping transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. While the dataset size (66 observations over 11 days) is not intended for broad generalization across the global commercial fleet, it provides an ideal test case. The use of sister ships, which are identical in design, creates a conservative environment to test for the paradox; the emergence of significant inter-vessel differences here would strongly suggest that even greater heterogeneity exists in more diverse commercial fleets. Thus, this study serves as a critical proof-of-concept to demonstrate the existence and potential magnitude of aggregation bias in maritime operational data.</p><p>This methodological study uses waste management as a case to demonstrate the risks of aggregation bias in maritime operational data. As such, it makes three hierarchical contributions. Primarily, it provides the first systematic documentation and analysis of Simpson's Paradox in shipboard operational environmental data, demonstrating that fleet-wide aggregation can fundamentally misrepresent vessel-specific waste generation patterns. Secondarily, it develops and validates high-predictive performance, ship-specific predictive models and quantifies the severe prediction errors of aggregated models, highlighting the practical consequences for waste storage planning and MARPOL compliance. Finally, it establishes a methodological framework for hierarchical analysis of maritime operational data, offering guidance for researchers and practitioners to avoid aggregation bias in future data-driven maritime management systems.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>The management of garbage from ships is governed by MARPOL Annex V, which has undergone significant evolution since its initial adoption in 1973. The most recent comprehensive revision, which entered into force in 2013, introduced a much stricter and more comprehensive regime for garbage disposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The revised regulations generally prohibit the discharge of all garbage into the sea, with very limited exceptions for specific circumstances and geographic areas.</p><p>The European Maritime Safety Agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] reports annual assessments of maritime safety and environmental compliance, noting progressive improvements in pollution prevention measures, though challenges persist in comprehensive waste management implementation and port reception facility coordination. According to the International Maritime Organization’s MARPOL Annex V regulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], ships must maintain comprehensive garbage record books and demonstrate compliance with waste disposal requirements, with training vessels often demonstrating exemplary compliance due to their educational focus on environmental stewardship.</p><p>Shipboard waste generation is a complex process influenced by multiple factors including vessel type, operational profile, crew size, and voyage duration. Kotrikla et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] conducted comprehensive characterization of waste generation onboard cruise ships, identifying that various operational areas including engine rooms contribute significantly to total solid waste generation, with composition and rates varying based on operational intensity and maintenance activities.</p><p>Recent characterization studies have provided insights into determinants of on-board waste management. Kuncowati [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] examined the interrelations among environmental concern, passenger perceptions, attitudes, and solid waste management performance on passenger vessels serving domestic routes from Tanjung Perak Port (Indonesia). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (SEM-PLS), they demonstrated that passenger attitudes have the strongest direct effect on waste management outcomes, such as sorting and collection. In contrast, environmental concern and perceptions influenced these outcomes indirectly through their effect on attitudes. These findings extend the theoretical foundation for passenger-centric quantitative modeling of shipboard waste systems and identify evidence-based levers for operational interventions, advancing well beyond descriptive approaches.</p><p>Sibarani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>] emphasized that variability in maritime operations, including maintenance schedules, operational intensity, and crew practices, significantly influences environmental performance and waste generation patterns, highlighting the importance of standardized procedures and continuous training. However, their study focused on commercial operations and did not examine the potential for hierarchical modeling approaches or statistical paradoxes in fleet-wide analysis.</p><p>The application of quantitative modeling to maritime operations has expanded significantly in recent decades, driven by advances in data collection capabilities and analytical methods. Yan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] provided a comprehensive review of data analytics applications for fuel consumption management in maritime operations, demonstrating that accurate predictive models and optimization techniques can achieve significant improvements in operational efficiency and environmental performance.</p><p>Advanced statistical methods are gaining traction in maritime applications. Solonen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] applied hierarchical (mixed-effects) Bayesian modeling for propulsion power across multiple vessels, showing the advantage of vessel-level random effects over pooled fleet-wide approaches in predictive performance. Shi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] used linear mixed-effects models in a simulator study of seafarers to quantify how individual characteristics shape risk perception during maritime emergencies, illustrating the effectiveness of hierarchical modeling for human-performance outcomes in multi-vessel contexts.</p><p>The choice between individual-vessel and fleet-wide modelling is a fundamental design decision in maritime analytics. Thorson and Minto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] provided a methodological review in marine science demonstrate that mixed-effects (hierarchical) models are essential whenever unit-specific effects matter, because they explicitly account for between-unit heterogeneity while enabling partial pooling for robust inference.</p><p>Recent applications indicate advantages of hierarchical/individual-vessel approaches over naïve fleet-wide models in propulsion-power/fuel prediction, owing to their ability to represent vessel-specific effects without sacrificing generalization across the fleet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. However, the risk of Simpson’s paradox in aggregated maritime datasets has been under-recognized; evidence from PSC ship-selection shows paradoxical reversals under simple weighted-sum rules, underscoring the need for hierarchical modelling and careful stratification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] demonstrated the application of advanced regression techniques for predicting ship fuel consumption, showing that different modeling approaches can reveal varying relationships in multi-vessel datasets, supporting the need for careful statistical analysis when examining fleet-wide operational data.</p><p>Recent developments in maritime analytics have explored advanced modeling approaches. Handayani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] focused on improving the understanding and prediction of fuel oil consumption (FOC) in cargo container ships, with an emphasis on improving energy efficiency and operational strategies.</p><p>Recent methodological syntheses in maritime operations underscore the value of triangulating across multiple modelling paradigms and enforcing rigorous calibration/validation. Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] review vessel-behaviour models, classify six paradigms, and assess models along representation, external impacts, and applicability—explicitly warning that insufficient calibration/validation limits transferability and urging future work to fit models to real-life conditions through systematic validation. Complementing this, Cariou and Cheaitou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] analyzed the impact of European policies on reducing marine oil pollution, highlighting the regulatory drivers for better waste management without providing predictive tools for operational waste streams. Similarly, while the challenges of international ship waste management are well-documented.</p><p>Recent reviews on AI and neural networks in maritime operations point to substantial opportunities across navigation, port operations, and safety/risk management, while simultaneously stressing the need for sound statistical foundations, high-quality data, and rigorous, transparent validation before deployment. In the port domain, Filom et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] present a systematic review of 70 studies that maps machine-learning use cases and methods for port operations, showing that prediction-oriented applications dominate and highlighting method- and application-centric research gaps that call for standardized datasets and clear evaluation protocols.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] comparing the complex regulatory frameworks of the IMO, China, the United States, the European Union, a gap remains in providing operators with reliable predictive models for compliance. From a safety and risk perspective, Durlik et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] synthesize AI applications and case studies and conclude that successful adoption requires standardized practices, robust regulatory frameworks, and careful attention to infrastructure compatibility and data quality. Collectively, this literature supports integrating advanced neural approaches within a disciplined analytical workflow grounded in statistical design, validation, and domain knowledge.</p><p>The integration of IoT and artificial intelligence technologies, as investigated by Fuqaha and Nursetiawan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], provides opportunities for real-time waste monitoring, predictive analytics, and smart waste management systems across various applications. However, implementation challenges include technological complexity and integration requirements with existing ship management systems.</p><p>Advanced waste treatment technologies, as assessed by Salem et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>] and Toneatti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], offer potential for on-board waste processing. However, these solutions require accurate waste generation prediction for optimal sizing and operational planning, highlighting the importance of predictive modeling research.</p><p>Despite the growing body of research in maritime environmental management, several critical gaps remain: (1) Quantitative Waste Prediction Models: Limited validated, quantitative models exist for predicting waste generation based on operational parameters; (2) Engine-Specific Analysis: Insufficient research has examined differences in waste generation between different engine types and operational modes; (3) Fleet-Level Analysis: Few studies have examined waste generation patterns across multiple similar vessels, missing opportunities to identify best practices and operational variations; (4) Statistical Paradox Investigation: No comprehensive investigation of Simpson's Paradox has been conducted for maritime waste prediction applications; (5) Real-World Validation: Most existing models lack validation with comprehensive real-world operational data from actual vessel operations.</p>

</inline-formula> 11 days). Daily measurements included engine running hours and solid waste weights for both Main Engine and Auxiliary Engine operations. Waste was collected and measured separately for each of the two main machinery sources: the Main Engine (M.E.) and the Auxiliary Engine (A.E.). While regulations categorize waste sources into different types (e.g., Type A and Type B), for the purpose of this operational study, the total waste from all sources associated with each engine was combined and measured as a single value per engine.</p>

This process is repeated six times, with each ship serving as the test set once. LOSO-CV provides a realistic estimate of how a fleet-wide model would perform when deployed on a new vessel not included in the training data. The average <inline-formula>

          <p>Leveraging Pearl’s conceptualization of causal frameworks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], Simpson’s Paradox in the present study pertains to instances where the correlation observed within the consolidated fleet data alters—or diminishes significantly—when the analysis is disaggregated by individual vessels. In assessing this situation, we set the regression model devised from the complete fleet next to the distinct models interpreted for every individual vessel. The paradox is deemed to manifest when the models at the ship level exhibit exceptionally robust explanatory capacity (<inline-formula>

A discernible divergence between the subgroup trajectories and the overall trajectory furnishes additional evidence that the aggregated findings obscure the fundamental relationships specific to each ship. This methodology provides a lucid and quantitative framework to identify instances where aggregation precipitates bias and to evaluate the magnitude of its influence on the analytical outcomes.</p>

The Main Engine (M.E.) operated for an average of 8.38 hours per day with an SD of 3.18 hours (range 2.5–15.0), indicating high variability (CV = 38.0%). In contrast, the Auxiliary Engine (A.E.) operated for 18.65 hours per day with an SD of 2.54 hours (range 12.0–23.9), reflecting more stable use (CV = 13.6%). These operational differences correspond to waste-generation patterns. M.E. waste averaged 127.6 g/day with an SD of 39.3 g (CV = 30.80%), while A.E. waste averaged 68.8 g/day with an SD of 9.0 g (CV = 13.08%).

This extraordinary consistency—identical correlation coefficients across all ships—indicates that the underlying operational relationship between Auxiliary Engine running hours and waste generation is highly standardized across the fleet, with 98.6% of waste variance explained by running hours. The minimal variation in correlation strength (coefficient of variation = 0.02%) suggests that Auxiliary Engine operations follow a predictable, mechanistic pattern that is robust across different crew practices, maintenance schedules, and operational contexts.</p>

          <p>The fleet-wide correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>), which aggregates all 66 observations, reveals a critical divergence in correlation patterns between Main Engine and Auxiliary Engine operations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> presents the fleet-wide correlation matrix, revealing the relationships between engine running hours and waste generation when all six ships are analyzed as a single aggregated dataset. The matrix demonstrates a critical divergence in correlation patterns between Main Engine and Auxiliary Engine operations. For Main Engine operations, the correlation between running hours and waste generation remains strong at the fleet level ($r$ = 0.946), indicating that the aggregated relationship closely mirrors the individual ship patterns. This high correlation suggests relative homogeneity in Main Engine waste generation behavior across the fleet, despite operational variations among vessels.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] applied a hierarchical (mixed-effects) Bayesian framework to propulsion-power/fuel modelling across 64 vessels, achieving improved predictive performance relative to classical resistance-based baselines and illustrating the value of modelling vessel-level heterogeneity. However, the current study demonstrates that simple individual ship linear regression models can achieve superior performance when Simpson’s Paradox is present, suggesting that model complexity is less important than appropriate data structure recognition.</p><p>The paradox arises because aggregation conflates two distinct sources of variation: within-ship variation (the relationship between engine hours and waste for a single vessel) and between-ship variation (differences in baseline waste generation rates across vessels, as shown by the different intercepts in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>). Our findings suggest that researchers and practitioners should exercise caution when drawing vessel-level inferences from fleet-level analyses.

For illustration, employing the fleet-wide model to forecast waste for a 10-day voyage may result in a cumulative predictive error exceeding 500 g per vessel, which could jeopardize as much as 10% of the standard weekly storage capacity allocated for this category of waste.

            <title>5.3. Quantitative assessment of the prediction</title>
          
          <p>To quantify the practical implications of this prediction error, we conducted a scenario analysis for a 10-day voyage. The baseline storage capacity of 5 kg was chosen as a conservative estimate for a small, dedicated waste container on a training ship, though this can vary. To assess the robustness of our findings, we performed a sensitivity analysis by varying both the assumed storage capacity (3,000 g; 5,000 g; 10,000 g) and the average daily running hours (8, 10, 12 hours). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_11">Table 11</xref>, the underestimation error remains significant across all scenarios. Even with a large 10,000 g storage tank and low 8-hour daily usage, the prediction error still consumes 2.2% of the available capacity. In a more demanding scenario with a small 3,000 g tank and high 12-hour daily usage, the error escalates to a critical 10.8% of storage capacity. This demonstrates that the risk of storage overflow due to flawed fleet-wide modeling is not an artifact of our initial assumptions but a robust finding with significant operational implications.</p>

          <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_11">Table 11</xref> presents a sensitivity analysis examining the practical consequences of prediction errors arising from the fleet-wide aggregated model compared to the per-ship models. The analysis considers three realistic storage capacity scenarios and three operational scenarios for daily engine running hours. The prediction error represents the systematic underestimation of waste generation by the fleet-wide model, which fails to account for ship-level heterogeneity.</p><p>The results demonstrate that the fleet-wide model consistently underestimates waste generation by approximately 217–325 g per day, depending on operational intensity. This systematic bias translates to a consumption of 2.2% to 10.8% of available storage capacity that was not accounted for in the prediction. The relative impact is most severe for vessels with smaller storage capacities: a vessel with 3,000 g capacity operating at 12 hours per day would experience a 10.8% underestimation, potentially exhausting storage capacity earlier than anticipated.</p>

            <title>5.4. Limitations and future research</title>
          
          <p>This study has several limitations that frame the scope of its conclusions and provide avenues for future research.</p><p><inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m5ur5uszc2">
    <mml:mo>∙</mml:mo>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> Limited Generalizability: The study was conducted on a homogenous fleet of six training ships over an 11-day period. While this served as an excellent proof-of-concept, the specific waste generation rates and model coefficients may not be generalizable to commercial vessels, different vessel types, or other operational contexts. Future research should aim to validate these findings on larger, more diverse commercial fleets over longer timeframes.</p><p><inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mzkd991bl9">
    <mml:mo>∙</mml:mo>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> Uncontrolled Confounding Variables: A key limitation is that this study did not control for several operational factors that could act as confounding variables. These include, but are not limited to, minor differences in vessel age, variations in maintenance history and condition, and differing crew practices or training intensity across voyages. While the vessels are sister ships, these unobserved factors could contribute to the between-ship variation in waste generation. However, it is important to note that the emergence of Simpson's Paradox and significant inter-vessel differences despite the fleet's relative homogeneity arguably strengthens the study's central conclusion. It suggests that if such distinct patterns can arise in a controlled setting, the risk of aggregation bias is likely even more pronounced in diverse commercial fleets where heterogeneity is the norm. Future research should aim to collect data on these potential confounders and employ hierarchical or mixed-effects models to formally disentangle their influence from inherent vessel-specific characteristics.</p><p><inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="m2i62yf1ef">
    <mml:mo>∙</mml:mo>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> Focus on Engine Room Waste: This study was limited to solid waste from engine room operations. Other significant waste streams (e.g., galley, accommodation, cargo-related waste) were not examined and may exhibit different generation patterns.</p><p><inline-formula>
  <mml:math id="mb9tgcdctt">
    <mml:mo>∙</mml:mo>
  </mml:math>
</inline-formula> Modeling Approach: Our analytical strategy compared two extreme modeling approaches: complete aggregation (fleet-wide models) versus complete disaggregation (per-ship models). While this comparison effectively demonstrates the paradox and its consequences, it does not explore intermediate approaches that could provide a more optimal balance between generalizability and accuracy. Specifically, we did not implement hierarchical mixed-effects models that explicitly account for the nested structure of the data (observations within ships) by estimating both fixed effects (common relationships across all ships) and random effects (ship-specific deviations from the common pattern). Such models represent the statistical gold standard for analyzing hierarchical data and would provide a more formal framework for quantifying the contribution of ship-level heterogeneity to overall variance. Mixed-effects models could also offer better out-of-sample prediction performance for new vessels by borrowing strength from the fleet-level data while accounting for vessel-specific characteristics. The development and validation of such models for maritime operational data is an important direction for future research and would complement the foundational findings of the current study.</p><p>Future research should therefore focus on: (1) replicating this study on commercial vessels; (2) investigating the prevalence of Simpson's Paradox in other maritime operational datasets (e.g., fuel consumption, emissions); (3) developing integrated, real-time waste management systems that leverage ship-specific predictive algorithms; and (4) the methodological lessons from this study likely extend to other domains of maritime data analysis, including fuel consumption modeling, emissions estimation, maintenance prediction, and safety risk assessment. Future research should systematically investigate whether aggregation bias is present in these domains and whether hierarchical modeling approaches are needed to avoid misleading conclusions.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study’s primary contribution is a methodological framework for detecting and mitigating aggregation bias in maritime operational data, using shipboard waste generation as a case study. It offers several key findings for both maritime data analytics and environmental management. Our analysis suggests that individual ship models, with predictive performance exceeding 97%, are substantially more reliable than conventional fleet-wide approaches, which can be prone to severe aggregation bias.</p><p>The central methodological finding is the first documentation of Simpson’s Paradox in shipboard operational environmental data. The strong positive correlation between auxiliary engine hours and waste generation observed at the individual ship level was masked at the aggregated fleet level. This finding serves as a methodological caution for the maritime analytics community, suggesting that fleet-wide aggregation can produce misleading results with significant operational consequences.</p><p>On a practical standpoint, the study provides precise waste generation benchmarks for training ships (9.04–11.05 g/hr for Main Engines; 4.28–4.32 g/hr for Auxiliary Engines) and demonstrates that ship-specific modeling can reduce prediction errors by up to 90%. In light of these findings, maritime operators should consider transitioning from fleet-wide estimates to vessel-specific modeling frameworks to enhance MARPOL Annex V compliance, optimize resource planning, and support data-driven environmental management.</p>

Tests include:</p><p>1. Shapiro_Wilk, Shapiro_p: Test for normality of residuals ($p &gt;$ 0.05 indicates residuals are normally distributed)</p><p>2. BP_LM, BP_p: Breusch-Pagan test for homoscedasticity ($p &gt;$ 0.05 indicates constant variance)</p><p>3. Durbin-Watson (DW): Test for autocorrelation (values between 1.4 and 2.8 indicate no significant autocorrelation)</p><p>4. Correlation ($r$): Pearson correlation coefficient between running hours and waste generation</p><p>Interpretation Summary by Ship and Engine:</p><p>Main Engine Models:</p><p>1. Malahayati, Kaisepo, Minahasa: Normality marginally acceptable ($p$ $\approx$ 0.029), homoscedasticity met, independence met. Models are valid.</p><p>2. Hasanuddin, Bung Tomo, Thamrin: All OLS assumptions fully met (all $p$ $&gt;$ 0.05, DW within range). Models are highly reliable.</p><p>Auxiliary Engine Models:</p><p>1. Malahayati, Kaisepo, Minahasa: Normality marginally acceptable ($p$ $\approx$ 0.029), homoscedasticity met, independence met. Models are valid.</p><p>2. Hasanuddin, Bung Tomo, Thamrin: Normality violated ($p$ $&lt;$ 0.001), but homoscedasticity and independence met. Despite normality violation, models remain valid due to very strong linear relationships ($r$ $&gt;$ 0.99) and robustness of OLS.</p>
