      <abstract><p>Urban resilience has become a central framework for advancing sustainable development in the context of escalating urban risks. To investigate the role of population density in shaping resilience, panel data from 114 large Chinese cities covering the period 2006–2021 (excluding the COVID-19 years to avoid potential distortions) were analyzed. A multidimensional urban resilience evaluation system was constructed, encompassing five key domains: economy, society, institutions, environment, and infrastructure. Resilience levels were assessed through the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), while a panel threshold regression model was applied to capture potential nonlinearities in the density–resilience relationship. Results demonstrate that urban resilience in China has exhibited a sustained upward trajectory, largely driven by advances in infrastructure provision and economic capacity. However, population density exerts a nonlinear “double-threshold effect”. At low levels of density, the effect on resilience is statistically insignificant; within a medium-density range, a pronounced negative impact emerges, constituting a “medium-density trap”; and at high densities, the adverse effects are attenuated, suggesting that urban systems may gradually adapt to intensified population pressures. This trap is most evident in regional center cities and rapidly developing urban areas, where governance capacity, infrastructure investment, and resource allocation have lagged behind demographic expansion. These findings highlight the stage-dependent vulnerabilities embedded in urbanization processes and indicate that resilience is not solely a function of density itself but also of institutional capacity and infrastructural adequacy. Differentiated governance strategies are therefore required, including targeted improvements in public infrastructure, strengthened institutional and administrative capacities, and the optimization of spatial configurations to accommodate density-specific challenges. By identifying the thresholds at which population density alters resilience trajectories, this study contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of urban vulnerability and offers actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance resilience under conditions of rapid urban growth and high-density development.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Amid rising global risks and increasing urban complexity, urban resilience has become a key indicator for assessing a city’s capacity to achieve sustainable development [1], [2]. It reflects a city’s ability to withstand and recover from disasters and public health crises as well as its adaptability to maintain essential functions under continuous change [3], [4]. As high-density development and compound risks intensify, balancing risk management and functional performance has become a major challenge for urban planning and governance [5].</p><p>Population density is a core structural factor shaping urban resilience, influencing land use patterns, resource allocation, infrastructure capacity, and environmental pressures [6]. Moderate density can enhance infrastructure efficiency, promote social cohesion, and improve resource utilization, strengthening a city's capacity to absorb and adapt to external disturbances [7], [8]. In contrast, excessive density often correlates with higher pollution levels, infrastructure overload, and increased psychological stress from noise and environmental discomfort [9], [10], [11]. Low-density sprawl, on the other hand, is linked to spatial fragmentation, underutilized land, and inefficiencies in public service delivery, which together undermine urban resilience [12].</p><p>Existing studies have indicated that the relationship between population density and urban resilience is not strictly linear; the direction and intensity of this effect may vary significantly across different density intervals [13], [14], [15], implying that threshold effects may exist rather than a simple one-way response pattern. Particularly during the transition from low to high density, differences in systemic pressure and regulatory capacity across different phases may lead to fluctuations in resilience performance. While some research has preliminarily revealed such nonlinear associations, the mechanisms underlying these patterns, especially across different types of cities and density stages, remain underexplored and lack systematic empirical validation.</p><p>Based on this, the study takes 114 prefecture-level and above cities in China as the research sample. It constructs an urban resilience index system covering the five dimensions mentioned above, evaluates resilience levels using the entropy-weighted TOPSIS method, and applies panel regression and threshold regression models to explore the nonlinear effects and underlying mechanisms of population density on urban resilience and its subsystems. The goal is to provide theoretical support and policy recommendations for managing urban population density and advancing resilience-oriented urban development.</p>
