      <abstract>The burgeoning population in Indonesia necessitates an escalation in energy provision. The reliance on diminishing fossil fuels, coupled with their adverse environmental repercussions, propels the exploration of renewable alternatives. This study investigates the techno-economic viability of implementing hybrid photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine systems across government edifices within five urban locales: Semarang, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Jakarta, and Denpasar. Employing the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER), simulations and optimizations of the hybrid systems were conducted, aiming to fulfil an electrical demand of 2636.1 kWh. The analysis is predicated on a 25-year operational lifespan. Results indicate that Denpasar presents the optimum potential for the hybrid system, with an annual electricity generation of 1,360,195 kWh surpassing the consumption demand of 1,214,136 kWh. The Net Present Cost (NPC) is calculated at IDR 27,529,340,000.00 and the Cost of Energy (COE) at IDR 997.17, yielding an attractive investment prospect with a Break Even Point (BEP) at 8.2 years. The estimated initial outlay for the Denpasar government building's PV system stands at IDR 4,149,376,743.96. The findings underscore the financial and technical feasibility of harnessing solar and wind synergies for sustainable energy solutions in Indonesian government infrastructure. These outcomes have pivotal implications for policy-making and strategic energy planning, demonstrating a replicable model for renewable integration in similar tropical regions.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>An escalating population trajectory is directly proportional to the burgeoning demand for energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. It is observed that primary energy reserves, specifically oil and coal, are diminishing, heralding the potential onset of energy deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The depletion of fossil fuel reserves, coupled with the exacerbation of the greenhouse effect, has catalyzed a quest for alternative, eco-friendlier energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Renewable energy is being widely researched and developed to overcome these various problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Intensive development has positioned solar energy as a renewable frontrunner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The intrinsic characteristics of solar energy, notably its chemical-free and non-radioactive nature, render it benign to the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. The application of solar energy is diverse, spanning electricity production, water heating, air heating, and support for various industrial drying processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of solar irradiance necessitates sophisticated technology for optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. It has been posited that hybrid power plants could offer an economical and efficient solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. The present study models an optimal generating system to address renewable energy requirements.</p><p>Solar and wind energy are burgeoning in popularity, with economic potential that is becoming increasingly competitive with that of conventional power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. These renewable sources are profuse in nature and their utilization does not contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, thereby affirming their environmental soundness. Indonesia, straddling the equator, reaps substantial solar irradiance annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. As an archipelagic nation subjected to monsoonal winds, it experiences two distinct seasons, offering opportunities to harness wind energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The synergy of solar and wind energy promises a complementary power source, with solar being predominant during the dry season and wind during the rainy season and nocturnal hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. The use of hybrid solar and wind energy has proven more effective than relying solely on solar energy in various regions of Indonesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p>Techno-economic analysis has been established as a necessary component in designing generating systems. This analytical approach quantifies in monetary terms the feasibility of engineering projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Such analysis has corroborated the viability of projects like the rooftop PLTS System on the Denpasar mayor's office [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, Arifin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>] have conducted simulations on the potential of interconnected PV-Wind hybrid systems in urban Java. This analysis aimed to create effective, renewable energy with technical, economic and environmental security to solve Indonesian energy crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. The current research utilizes the HOMER software to examine cost-effectiveness and economic feasibility for power generation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this research is to simulate PV-Wind hybrid energy as a sustainable, efficient, and eco-friendly source of electrical energy for government buildings in Semarang, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Jakarta, and Denpasar cities. The adoption of an on-grid system configuration, connecting with the PLN (Perusahaan Listrik Negara) electricity network, is considered. This study analyses the techno-economic aspects of PV-Wind hybrid power generation for Indonesian government buildings, with simulation outcomes offering comparative insights and evaluation of factors affecting cost-effectiveness in system design.</p>

            <title>2.2. Description of the hybrid pv-turbine system design model</title>
          
          <p>The design of the Hybrid PV-Wind Turbine System was modeled utilizing the HOMER software, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. This tool facilitates the optimization of microgrid configurations, allowing for the computation of total energy output and variations in system costs, as well as the economic and financial feasibility of different designs. HOMER is instrumental in the assessment of power generation systems, determining their suitability for grid-connected (On-Grid) or off-grid (Off-Grid) applications.</p><p>In this methodology, HOMER was employed to identify the most efficient system configuration, prioritizing the results based on the NPC from the lowest to the highest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Such a prioritization ensures the selection of the most cost-effective system to fulfill the electricity requirements of government buildings. Within the scope of this research, the specifications for the solar panel comprised the Schneider Conext CL25000 E with a generic PV model. The wind turbine selected was the Bergey Excel 6-R series, and the inverter was the KEHUA France KF-BCS 630K-B series. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> presents the On-Grid system design as conceptualized using the HOMER software.</p>

          <p>Within the configuration under study, the solar panel array is connected to a wind turbine, serving as a direct current (DC) input. An inverter is then employed to transform the DC voltage from the PV cells and the turbine into alternating current (AC) voltage, which is subsequently delivered to the electrical load. Should the voltage generated by the renewable sources prove insufficient for the demands of government buildings, the national electricity utility, PLN, is posited to supplement the shortfall, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>In this investigation, an evaluative comparison was conducted of on-grid hybrid PV-Wind Turbine PLTS tailored for governmental structures across five major Indonesian urban centers: Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Jakarta, and Denpasar. Utilising the HOMER software, system configurations were simulated and optimized. The results indicate a superior efficiency and cost-effectiveness for the hybrid (PV/Wind) system over a standard PV system, given identical electrical loads.</p><p>It was revealed through modelling that the hybrid system, when connected to the grid, obviates the need for supplementary battery storage under standard operational parameters. Moreover, surplus renewable energy is seamlessly integrated into the grid. Pertinent metrics considered in the assessment of system design potential encompassed total electrical output, consumption figures, NPC, COE, and BEP.</p><p>The simulations executed via the HOMER software identified Denpasar as the city with the highest potential for the implementation of hybrid PV/Wind Turbine systems in government buildings. The findings demonstrate Denpasar's capability to generate 1,360,195 kWh/year, with total electricity consumption recorded at 1,214,136 kWh/year. The NPC was determined at approximately IDR 27,529,340,000.00, and the COE was ascertained at IDR 997.17, suggesting a viable investment with the BEP projected at 8.2 years. The estimated initial construction cost for the PLTS at government edifices in Denpasar stands at IDR 4,149,376,743.96.</p><p>It is envisaged that the outcomes of this study will contribute to the advancement of renewable energy utilization, notably in harnessing solar and wind energy. The innovation presented by this hybrid PLTS design is anticipated to facilitate a reduction in future investment costs for componentry. Consequently, such hybrid power generation systems are poised for escalated development in the ensuing years.</p>
