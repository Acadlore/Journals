      <abstract><p>The shift to a green economy presents substantial barriers to sustainable economic growth. A key component of promoting a sustainable and green growth trajectory is educating the public about environmental sustainability, climate change, and the green economy. The main aim of this study is to evaluate students' understanding of green economy, and environmental concerns while highlighting the contribution of education to the green transition. The study was carried out in Kosovo using a quantitative method approach in a sample from 425 students including undergraduate, master and PhD. The analysis examined in this study are Multiple Regression Analysis, Pearson Correlations, Cronbach's Alpha, Inter item correlations, and descriptive statistics using IBM SPSS program Multiple Regression results showed that students' intention to continue their education in the green economy was significantly predicted by factors like comprehension of environmental policies, confidence in comprehending global economic challenges, and belief in the significance of government policies for the green transition. Significantly, students' willingness to participate in green economy studies was inversely connected with their comprehension of the role of law in environmental issues, indicating a possible discrepancy between perceived readiness and actual participation. The findings indicate that students possess a limited understanding of the green economy and environmental concerns in Kosovo; however, they are quite enthusiastic about expanding their knowledge, particularly via bachelor’s and master’s programs focused on these topics. Considering these results, the research proposes that to enhance awareness and preparedness for the green transition, new educational programs and vocational training efforts should be established alongside targeted conferences. These initiatives are crucial for providing professionals and students with the resources necessary for a sustainable future. Proper education can have a fundamental impact on environmental protection and sustainable economic development thus policymakers and universities must collaborate to create applicable study programs and curricula that promote a stronger focus on green and sustainable education.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Green growth and the green economy are examples of worldwide trends toward sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. In order to support sustainable economic development and skill “greening” through knowledge creation, distribution, and utilization, the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] focuses on policy-level collaborations among Vocational Education and Training (VET) providers, industry, government, and other stakeholders. Eco-innovation is crucial for sustainable practices and environmental issues, influenced by consumer demand and collaboration. Implementation is hindered by costs and regulations. Furthermore, study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>] demonstrates that developing skills is essential for harnessing the employment opportunities presented by green growth, but skill gaps are increasingly hindering the achievement of this potential. Also, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] demonstrated how education has a major impact on lowering pollution emissions. Another study emphasizes the green economy and identifies as contributing factors: higher education, media, company policies, as well as the growth of green economies including carbon taxes, eco-industrial parks, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Additionally, the research supports green growth through economic strategies, involving multiple stakeholders and governance structures, encouraging synergies between environmental sustainability and economic development, instead of merely separating them.</p><p>Khamdamov et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>] discussed how important education, innovation, and inclusive growth policies are to supporting a smooth transition to a green economy. Further, Langthaler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>] found that sustainable and equitable society depends on people's capacity for learning, however traditional institutions are lagging in teaching transformative abilities. Beyond transmitting technical abilities, Vocational Education and Training (VET) is not clearly defined for systemic reforms in a green economy. Developing knowledge, skills and competences in the green economy is essential and a precondition for sustainable economic growth. Among other aspects, the focus must be on encouraging graduates to advance their professional training in green practices, as well as educating all citizens, which is crucial for enhancing the green economy and safeguarding the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. “Education is a crucial factor for sustainable economic growth” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. According to the findings from Ali et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], the Ghana’s primary advantages towards greening are its geographic location, environmental regulations, potential for a green energy mix, youthful and vibrant populace, and its initiatives to lower poverty and illiteracy rates.</p><p>This study primarily aims to evaluate students’ understanding of the green economy within the context of Kosovo and to explore their perspectives on future employment in green economic sectors. This study is the first of its kind to be conducted in the case of a developing country with numerous challenges towards sustainable economic growth and greening practices. Maintaining the momentum towards growth and familiarity with green practices is essential for achieving a sustainable economy in the long term. Education is the main pillar towards achieving knowledge on the importance of green economy and among others creates opportunities for knowledge skills and competencies of students which are the main resource in a knowledge-based economy. This study is very important because for the first time it is applied in Kosovo, it highlights the importance of education towards raising public awareness about climate change, the green economy and sustainable growth, moreover, it also assesses for the first time students' knowledge on green practices, and determines the need for future study programs, specific training and conferences on the environment, green transition and sustainable economic growth. Governments and businesses are starting to recognize the circular economy's (CE) potential and are moving forward with implementing sustainable practices. But by alone, they are unable to bring about the structural adjustments required to alter the existing economic structure. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a crucial role in this regard since they are supposed to support innovative ideas for societies and economies outside of lecture halls that foster a CE mindset and environmentally conscious citizenship in addition to offering advice to their stakeholders on the subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p>

            <title>1.1. Research questions</title>
          
          <p>•To what extent are university students in Kosovo informed about the economic, legal, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and the green economy?</p><p>•How do university students’ perceptions of career opportunities in green sectors vary according to their educational background and exposure to sustainability-related coursework or content?</p><p>•What is the relationship between students’ educational experiences and their willingness to pursue further education or employment in organizations focused on environmental governance and the green economy? </p><p>Although sustainability and the green transition are receiving increasing global attention, developing countries such as Kosovo continue to face significant challenges in aligning their educational systems with the demands of a green economy. Despite young people being a key driver of change, limited empirical evidence exists on how effectively universities prepare students in areas such as environmental law, regulatory frameworks, and the socioeconomic impacts of sustainability. Furthermore, uncertainty remains regarding students’ readiness and willingness to pursue careers in green sectors, particularly in contexts where institutional capacity and policy support are still underdeveloped. Addressing this gap is essential for designing curricula and educational policies that foster sustainable economic growth through well-informed and actively engaged future professionals.</p>

            <title>1.2. The study hypothesis</title>
          
          <p>Hypothesis 1: Students' tendency to seek additional education in sustainability and environmental policies is significantly predicted by their level of knowledge and confidence in their comprehension of the issues facing the global green economy.</p><p>Hypothesis 2: Students are more likely to show interest in pursuing additional education related to the green economy if they think that economic growth, laws and policies are crucial for advancing the green transition.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Students are more likely to seek additional education and training in sustainability and the green economy if they have been exposed to environmental issues during their academic careers.</p><p>These hypotheses were developed to investigate the variables affecting students’ readiness for additional training and education in sustainability and the green economy.</p><p>The research aims to provide valuable insights into the elements affecting students’ engagement in green education by exploring their understanding, their confidence in grasping global environmental challenges, and their perspective on the significance of regulations and policies in the green transition.</p><p>With the primary objective of aiding in the development of more effective educational initiatives that foster sustainable growth and the green transition, the study also seeks to evaluate how students’ aspirations to continue their education in this area are influenced by their engagement with environmental topics throughout their academic pursuits.</p><p>Examining previous theoretical and empirical contributions in the field is crucial to comprehending the opportunities and problems associated with students’ awareness of the green economy and the role that education plays in promoting sustainable transition. As a result, a review of pertinent literature is given in the following section, with particular attention to the conceptual underpinnings of the green economy, the role that education plays in advancing sustainability, and local and global viewpoints on integrating academic programs with sustainable development objectives.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Many research efforts have focused on examining education related to a green economy, covering areas such as green entrepreneurship, government policies, and macroeconomic factors.</p><p>More sustainable production and consumption models must be developed in the real context of climate change, population increase, and global economic adjustment in order to decrease the use of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions and subsequently transition to low-carbon societies and a green economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. In this regard the education matters. Because they tackle the intricate scientific research on the green transition and give students from a variety of backgrounds the opportunity to learn new skills, integrate different viewpoints, and manage the sustainability of the current and future renewable energy sector, universities play a crucial role in ensuring a sustainable future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>Universities employ a lot of people, draw in businesses, and help students find employment. Higher education institutions are essential economic engines. In order to address both the economic crisis and environmental deterioration, they also collaborate with neighborhood organizations to offer practical experiences and support the green economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Another study emphasized that investment in research and development is also a pillar that helps integrate green practices into society, emphasizing the importance of moving from theory to practical implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, Ma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] emphasized that the increase quality in the of the higher education study programs is a major driver of green economic growth and the supply of creative human capital.</p><p>A study using a sample of 284 bachelor and master students and applying the SEM model finds that education is significant towards green entrepreneurship and concludes that policymakers and universities should jointly develop relevant study programs and curricula for a greater trend towards green and sustainable education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] applied the ARDL model to the case of China for the period 1990-2022 and suggests greater education towards greening, international collaborations towards sustainable resources, and innovative economic practices.</p><p>Another study investigates the importance of education and income towards the green transition by surveying 1400 households and finds that education is a very important indicator towards achieving sustainability and the green transition along with gender. It also emphasizes that economic, social and environmental aspects must work together in an integrated manner to achieve results towards greening and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. It is important to note from an economic perspective that green economic growth is a way to raise income levels while maintaining environmental integrity, thus the investment in education is crucial to boost green growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. This strategy prioritizes social inclusion in addition to environmental and economic sustainability. Education investments contribute to the development of the human capital required to produce a trained workforce capable of promoting sustainable practices and green innovation. It also gives communities the ability to actively engage in green projects, promoting social justice and raising living standards. Green growth may continue to be unequal and fail to benefit all facets of society if the social dimension is not addressed.</p><p>The vast potential of education in addressing complex economic, environmental, and legal challenges is increasingly recognized in the worldwide dialogue on sustainable development.</p><p>The international literature is highlighting the necessity of changing conventional approaches to economic growth and education in light of the growing significance of sustainable development and the pressing issues presented by the climate crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. Sharing and enhancing greening knowledge is a crucial aspect of this transition, since it is essential for advancing the shift towards a more sustainable and inclusive economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Given this, it is imperative to understand the ways in which the global debate on green knowledge is developing and to highlights the key themes influencing it.</p><p>Newton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] found important evidence that a knowledge-based economy must necessarily pass through green knowledge to reach a green economy. For this fact, we can say that proper education can have a fundamental impact on environmental protection and sustainable economic development. Gbadamosi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] assessed how much teachers know about the concept of green economy and the importance of environmental protection in a sample of 100 teachers by applying a questionnaire and ANOVA analysis. The study finds variable results regarding teachers' knowledge and suggests institutions to apply green curricula, trainings and workshops. A study using a Google Forms questionnaire to assess the demand for a master's program in renewable energy finds a positive correlation between students' willingness to pursue a master's program in green transformation energy and employment opportunities in the green sector. The study further recommended new academic programs restructured towards greening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>].</p><p>The importance of education is also discussed by Anzelini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] who emphasized that the availability of the necessary skills to fill new positions and responsibilities is crucial to the green transition's success. Significant employment losses may result from job displacement in brown industries that are being phased out, which is made worse by shifts in the labor market’s need for certain skills. Known as “skill mismatches“, this misalignment can take many different forms. Another study emphasizes the fact that the more informed a business is, the greener they are [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, according to the findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>], businesses that prioritize the green transition should make encouraging sustainable behaviors a central component of their approach.</p><p>Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] highlighted that, in an era when nations assert economic growth, particular attention should be paid to European best practices for the green economy in order to protect the environment. because the Western Balkan nations—Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia—are unique in terms of the transitional difficulties they have encountered as well as their inherited energy infrastructure. We may address the justification for the necessity of study curricula aimed at a green transition in this perspective. By driving innovation and enhancing competitiveness, skilled individuals can strengthen the European Union’s economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. Further the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>] assessed that ICT, higher education, and the use of renewable energy can all help the country to achieve green growth and better environmental conditions. In the process of transition, educational interventions are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>]. Like other megatrends, the greening of the economy is transforming the workplace. Determining which professions—often referred to as “green jobs” or “green occupations”—will be in high demand in the green economy and the skills necessary for them is essential to facilitating and promoting a promoting economic growth while maintaining a planet that is environmentally sustainable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>].</p><p>Gustavsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] stated that the rapid digitalization and the green transition are two major changes that the industrial sector is going through. To speed up the industry’s green transition, this calls for concentrating on the development of digital and green capabilities. Education may give aspiring designers the tools they need to overcome the challenges posed by the convergence of goals like the green transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, Josopu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>] showed a lack of cooperation in incorporating environmental sustainability into the Sector Skills Plan to enhance knowledge and abilities for a fair transition to a more environmentally friendly economy. Busemeyer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>] found that people's views of the dangers associated with the green transition and digitization in the job market are impacted by contextual factors at the individual and national levels rather than being systematically different. Green industries that require a lot of human capital will grow quickly, creating a lot of green jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Higher education institutions are open to prepare graduates for the upcoming challenges towards green transition and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>].</p><p>The need to change conventional approaches to economic growth and education is becoming more and more apparent in the international literature as the significance of sustainable development and the pressing issues presented by the climate crisis grow. Spreading and enhancing greening knowledge is a crucial aspect of this change, as it is crucial for propelling the transition to a more sustainable and inclusive economy. Given this, it is imperative to comprehend the ways in which the global conversation on green knowledge is developing and to pinpoint the key themes influencing it.</p>

            <title>2.1. Global trend in greening knowledge</title>
          
          <p>Climate change is accelerating global efforts toward green transition strategies and sustainable practices. To effectively educate societies about climate challenges, the 2022 UN Transforming Education Summit emphasized the need for a comprehensive transformation of education systems.. Climate education is crucial for sustainable development, resilience building, impact mitigation, and climate justice, according to the Youth Declaration. The essential necessity for an all-encompassing approach to education is highlighted by the young people 's expressed need for education that enables them to take significant action on climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. Universities worldwide are being forced to change their curricula and add materials pertaining to the advancement of sustainable development to their current ones as a result of growing environmental issues and the growing demand for green jobs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>]. Based on the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], the goals 1 (ending poverty), 3 (healthy lives), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate change), and 16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions) of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, are all greatly aided by higher education. To successfully accomplish these objectives, higher education institutions' organizational culture and strategy must be centered on sustainability principles. Abo-Khalil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>] highlighted how important higher education is in equipping the next generation to successfully comprehend and handle the complexity of sustainability issues. Ni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>] implied that adopting green curricula has a favorable impact on pro-environmental behavior, environmental orientation, and other aspects of sustainability. Given the complicated issues confronting the earth and humanity, there is an increasing need to instill sustainability ideas in the next generation of global citizens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>]. Future-focused universities include sustainability and environmental effect in their curriculum, while some colleges incorporate sustainability and environmental goals into their strategy. The top-ranked universities, such as Wageningen University &amp;amp;amp; Research, the University of Nottingham, the University of Groningen, the University of California, Davis, and Nottingham Trent University, provide its students with more advantages than only ecological and sustainability courses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>]. </p>

          <p>The medium- and long-term sustainable development of Kosovo is intended to be guided by the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NDS). It distinguishes four horizontal agendas: Diaspora and Migration, Digital Agenda, Inclusion, and Green Agenda. In order to enhance public services, boost economic efficiency, and promote a digital society, the Digital Agenda focuses on technology and digitalization. While the Green Agenda encourages environmentally friendly growth and the Kosovar diaspora, the Inclusion agenda guarantees equal chances for everyone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>]. Top universities and colleges in Kosovo are listed in the National H-index Ranking NHR 2023, along with their ranks and the most recent H-index for a number of research platforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>]. Despite some possible environmental and sustainability courses, they do not provide a degree program on the green economy and sustainable development.</p>

To guarantee broad institutional representation, the survey was disseminated physically and electronically via social media. Only enrolled students were eligible to participate, and it was entirely voluntary. Duplicate or incomplete responses were not included in the final dataset. To reduce sampling bias and guarantee balance across academic fields, responses were gathered proportionately from the main academic disciplines (economics, law, education, and environmental sciences). 425 valid responses from students at various public and private universities in Kosovo were included in the final dataset. No identifying information was gathered during the anonymous survey. To reduce order bias and social desirability, the questions were arranged in a random order. To guarantee the accuracy and dependability of the data, any responses that were missing or duplicated were not included in the analysis.</p>

            <title>3.2. Demographic characteristics</title>
          
          <p>The final sample consisted of 424 valid responses from students studying across different faculties and levels at both public and private universities in Kosovo. The demographic distribution was balanced, with men comprising 43.4% of participants and women making up 56.6%. The remaining 30.2% of participants were mature learners and professionals engaged in postgraduate or continuing education, while the largest share of respondents (20.8%) fell within the 18 to 25 age range, 11.3% were aged 26 to 35, 15.1% belonged to the 36 to 40 age group, and 22.6% were over 40 years old. 32.1% were first-year master's students, 15.1% were in their second year of master's studies, 15.1% had completed their master's degree, 9.4% were pursuing doctoral studies, and 16.9% were bachelor's students in their first, second, or third year. This suggests a sample that mainly targets advanced educational levels. The largest portion of participants came from the Faculty of Economics (84.9%), followed by Computer Sciences (5.7%), Social Sciences (3.8%), and other faculties (5.7%). Due to the dataset's makeup, meaningful conclusions can be made regarding students' awareness and views on matters concerning the green economy, as the survey was filled out by a varied demographic and academically diverse set of respondents (See Appendix Table A1).</p>

            <title>3.4. Data analysis and statistical procedures</title>
          
          <p>To achieve a comprehensive understanding of students’ knowledge and views on the green economy, we employed a quantitative methods approach. Quantitative data obtained from Likert scale questions facilitated a statistical examination of trends and correlations. Through the use of appropriate techniques to handle absent replies and detailing the procedures for data coding and analysis, we ensured that the data cleaning process remained clear. Robust insights into the research queries were derived from statistical analysis via SPSS, encompassing factor analysis, regression, descriptive statistics, and Pearson correlations. Furthermore, Cronbach’s alpha (0.820) was used to evaluate the questionnaire’s reliability, demonstrating strong internal consistency. The methodology of the study was crafted to guarantee the credibility of results, providing a straightforward and duplicable method for subsequent investigations.</p><p>All of the items were measured on five-point Likert scales, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, which approximate interval-level data and enable the evaluation of linear associations between continuous-like variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">53</xref>]. Pearson's correlation was utilized to investigate linear relationships among the variables. According to accepted methodological practice in social science research, the dependent variable, “Likelihood to continue studies in the field of the green economy and environmental policies”, was treated as continuous even though it is technically ordinal. Linear regression offers reliable and comprehensible estimates of relationships when Likert-type composite or averaged measures have five or more response categories and exhibit a nearly normal distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_54">54</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_55">55</xref>]. The use of multiple linear regression for modeling behavioral intentions was supported by preliminary diagnostic tests that validated the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normally distributed residuals.</p>

      <title>4. Results</title>
      <p>The shift to a green economy undoubtedly starts with effective education, and it is not by chance that students' perceptions of the future are crucial for advancing a sustainable and green economy Students and their experience gained during education undoubtedly represent the main pillar towards informing the public about the importance of preserving the environment during the trends of sustainable economic development and growth. The concept of the green economy, according to the results obtained from this study, is not sufficiently known to students, however, students appreciate that the green economy is very important and for this reason they would like to pursue further education in this field. This section presents the results of the study, including statistical findings, specifically the frequencies of the questions asked in the questionnaire, as well as the econometric analysis of multifactorial linear regression. Further, the Pearson correlation analysis and the chi square test are presented.</p><p>The frequency analysis of the participants' responses is reflected in the results shown in the above table (See Appendix Table A1).</p><p>This study, the first of its kind in Kosovo, provides insight into university students' awareness and readiness for sustainable development and the green economy. A substantial (32%) of the 425 students in the sample are first-year master's students, and the majority (84.9%) are from the Faculty of Economics. The sample is primarily made up of female respondents (56.7%).</p><p>One important finding is that 71.5% of students said they had never taken a course on sustainability, the green economy, legal frameworks, or environmental studies. This is highly correlated with their moderate familiarity with the green economy, as only 19.1% said they were very well informed, while the remaining students knew very little or nothing about it. This demonstrates how little green economy content is incorporated into Kosovo's higher education curricula and directly supports the study's goal of identifying knowledge gaps.</p><p>Regardless these discrepancies, a significant number of respondents (92.5%) agreed or completely agreed that environmental sustainability and economic growth must be balanced. Furthermore, 86.8% of respondents thought that education had a high or very high influence on how laws and environmental policies are shaped, highlighting the study's main contention that education has the capacity to transform.</p><p>Regarding potential future employment, 77.4% said they would be open to working in fields related to sustainability, and 65.9% expressed interest in environmental policy-focused careers in the public sector. Only 49.2% of respondents, however, think that Kosovo's green economy offers enough job opportunities. This confirms the difficulties developing nations face in promoting green sectors by pointing to a misalignment between student goals and perceived market opportunities. Additionally, there were conflicting findings regarding legal and institutional awareness: Only 16.9% strongly agreed that they are aware of the legal-economic ramifications, despite 69.6% acknowledging the significance of law and public administration in the green transition. A concerning 62.1% of students believed that there was insufficient information about sustainable development and legal requirements in university curricula. Only 22.8% of respondents were highly motivated, despite the fact that a sizable majority (71.5%) said they were likely to pursue additional education in green economy topics. This suggests that program offerings and institutional encouragement could be strengthened.</p><p>The findings explicitly meet the study's primary goal by emphasizing two important findings: first, that students' knowledge and comprehension of green economic concepts and associated legal frameworks is inadequate and needs to be strengthened through curriculum; and second, that students in Kosovo exhibit a promising propensity to contribute to green economic transformation in spite of structural obstacles. In order to better prepare future generations for the challenges of sustainable development, the findings provide a basis for reforming educational content and enhancing policy linkages.</p>
      <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> presents the results obtained from the Pearson correlation analysis which was contacted to examine attitudinal and awareness-based variables in order to better understand students’ orientation toward green economic sectors as well as their familiarity with legal and environmental frameworks. The majority of the variables showed significant and positive correlations with one another, confirming the interdependence of education, awareness, and future career orientation and showing internal consistency in students’ perceptions.</p>

</inline-formula>&lt;$ 0.01), Q6 (educational preparedness) and Q7 (legal-economic awareness) also have a strong correlation, indicating that institutional education is crucial in influencing students’ comprehension of the role of the law in environmental transformation. It is noteworthy that although students generally value education as a driver of sustainability, Q8 (belief in education's impact on the green transition) exhibits weaker but statistically significant correlations with all variables. This suggests that students' self-assessed competencies and career aspirations are not as strongly correlated with this belief.</p>

            <title>4.1. Theoretical interpretation of correlation findings</title>
          
          <p>A number of statistically significant relationships between students’ awareness, attitudes, and behavioral intentions regarding the green economy and environmental sustainability are revealed by the correlation results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. These correlations imply that students who exhibit greater institutional framework and environmental policy knowledge are also more likely to be motivated to seek higher education or careers in sustainability-related fields. Beyond the correlations’ statistical significance, it’s critical to consider how these relationships fit into the theoretical framework that served as the study's compass. In order to highlight how awareness leads to intention and action, the following section examines these findings via the prism of the Theory of Planned Behavior and related environmental awareness frameworks.</p><p>In terms of students' comprehension and involvement with the green economy, the correlation analysis shows both statistically significant relationships and significant behavioral patterns.

The regression equation fits the data better than a model without predictors, as further supported by the significance level (p = 0.000). Students' awareness of legal and environmental issues, their willingness to relocate for green jobs, their perception of the importance of government policies, their study level, their gender, and their perception of job opportunities in the green economy are all reflected in the independent variables included in the model.</p><p>The regression coefficients results offer comprehensive information about how each independent variable contributes to the dependent variable, which is the probability that students will seek additional education or training in environmental policies and the green economy as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>.</p>

          <p>Predictors: (Constant), On a scale of 1 to 5, how well do you understand the role of law in addressing global environmental issues? (1 = not at all, 5 = very well), Are you interested in working for government agencies or public institutions focused on environmental policies and the green economy? Do you believe there are sufficient career opportunities for students in green economy and legal harmonization? Gender, Have you learned about environmental challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss in your studies? How much do you agree with the following statement: “I feel confident in my understanding of the global economic challenges towards a green economy”, Would you be willing to relocate for a job in the field of environmental sustainability and the green economy? How familiar are you with the concept of sustainable growth and green economy? To what extent do you believe education can influence environmental policies, the green economy, and law enforcement? Study level, Do you think government policies and laws are crucial for promoting the green transition?</p><p>“How confident you are with the following statement: ‘I feel confident in my understanding of the global economic challenges towards a green economy’” p = 0.000, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.129): This predictor is a significant force in determining whether individuals will or won't pursue further education or training in the green economy. The higher the degree of confidence individuals have in their understanding of world economic issues, the higher the likelihood of pursuing further training or education in the same.</p><p>“Do you think that government policy and legislation are crucial to securing the green transformation?” p = 0.000, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.156): The factor is significant and indicates that as more individuals believe that government policies and legislation are crucial for the development of the green economy, they would be more likely to opt for additional training or education in the same.</p><p>“Do you think you have studied about environmental issues like climate change, depletion of natural resources, and loss of biodiversity in your courses?” p = 0.000, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.173): The variable is significant, indicating that those who have learned about environmental issues are likely to pursue extra training or education in the green economy.</p><p>“Would you like to work for government agencies or public institutions specializing in environmental policy and the green economy?” p = 0.011, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.069): It is a substantively significant variable. Students interested in jobs within government institutions with a focus on the green economy are likely to pursue more training or further study within the industry.</p><p>“Do you think there are enough career chances for students within green economy and legal harmonization?” p = 0.002, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.040): This is another significant variable. As more and more individuals become aware of the career opportunity in green economy and legal harmonization, there would be a growing tendency to invest in higher education or a learning program.</p><p>“How willing would you be to move for a job within the field of environmental sustainability and the green economy?” p = 0.000, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.210): This is a significant variable, which shows that individuals who are ready to move for environmental sustainability employment are likely to seek further education or training in this field.</p><p>“On a scale of 1 to 5, how well do you understand the role of law in addressing global environmental issues?” p = 0.000, unstandardized coefficient (B = -0.111): This is a highly significant variable with a negative sign. For every rise in awareness of the role of law in addressing global environmental issues, there is less possibility of further studies or training. It indicates that as one gain more awareness about the law, one may not think about studying further in this area.</p>

            <title>4.2. Variables with p-value $&gt;$ 0.05 (not significant)</title>
          
          <p>Gender p = 0.149, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.065): This is a non-significant variable, and gender does not have any significant influence on the probability of further study in the field of the green economy.</p><p>Study level p = 0.454, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.011): This is a non-significant variable, and the study level (for example, undergraduate, master's) does not have any significant influence on the probability of further study in this field.</p><p>To what extent do you believe education can impact environmental policy, the green economy, and policing? p = 0.277, unstandardized coefficient (B = 0.036): The variable is nonsignificant and suggests that a belief in whether education can impact environmental policies is not contributing at all to obtaining further education.</p><p>How familiar are you with the concept of sustainable growth and green economy? p = 0.024, unstandardized coefficient (B = -0.103): Although this variable is significant with p = 0.024, it possesses a negative sign, indicating that as familiarity about sustainable growth and the green economy increases, taking further education or training becomes a little less probable. This would imply that better-known individuals would feel they do not need more education in the same.</p><p>Predictors that significantly determine the likelihood of continuing education or training in the green economy are knowledge and concern for environmental issues, for instance, gaining awareness of environmental issues and believing that one can understand global economic issues.</p><p>Government policies and career opportunities also play a very important part.</p><p>Variables such as education level, gender, and how education plays a role in shaping policies are not important, that is, they do not greatly influence the probability of taking further education in the green economy.</p><p>The regression analysis's findings provide crucial new information about the variables influencing students' propensity to seek additional education and training in environmental policies and the green economy. According to the analysis, students' intention to pursue higher education is significantly predicted by their awareness of environmental issues, their comprehension of the function of laws and policies, and their readiness to relocate in search of green employment opportunities. These results demonstrate how more interest in green jobs and sustainable practices can be generated by educational programs and career development opportunities that highlight global economic challenges, sustainability policies, and workable solutions to environmental problems.</p><p>Curiously, a paradoxical effect is suggested by the negative coefficients for variables pertaining to knowledge of the green economy and the role of law in international environmental issues. Students who already think they know a lot about these topics might be less likely to pursue additional education, which suggests that educational systems should balance introducing new, useful, and developing aspects of the green economy with reinforcing what they already know. This research also highlights the need for interdisciplinary learning models that emphasize the real-world applications of sustainability while also enhancing theoretical knowledge.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of significant results for gender or study level indicates that students from a variety of demographic backgrounds show comparable patterns of interest and intention toward the green economy, highlighting the universal applicability of sustainability education in higher education systems irrespective of demographic factors.</p><p>The study's findings ultimately highlight how urgently higher education institutions in Kosovo and other developing nations must reconsider and modernize their curricula to better reflect the objectives of global sustainability and the burgeoning green industries. A workforce that is equipped to handle the intricate problems of sustainable economic growth can be shaped in large part by universities putting an emphasis on education that incorporates environmental awareness, legal frameworks, and green career pathways.</p><p>For institutions, educators, and legislators looking to strengthen the educational underpinnings for a sustainable future, these findings offer insightful information. In order to guarantee that students acquire not only theoretical knowledge but also the practical skills and confidence to actively contribute to the global green transition, the study also provides opportunities for future research on how to better connect educational systems to green job markets.</p><p>The dependent variable used here in the regression analysis is “How likely are you to pursue further education or training related to the green economy and environmental policies after graduation?”, and a few independent variables were experimented with to see how they influence this likelihood.

Students who believe they have a good understanding of the legal aspects of environmental issues may feel less compelled to pursue further education in this area.</p><p>There are several statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of pursuing further education or training in the green economy and environmental policy, including trusting one's knowledge of global economic concerns, faith in government policy responsibilities, exposure to environmental problems, interest in government agency careers, career opportunities in the green economy, and willingness to relocate for a job. These are the variables which have a positive relationship with the dependent variable since they are beliefs or characteristics possessed by students that lead them towards more education or training. The influence of education on policies, however, the level of study, gender, and knowledge about sustainable growth had no significant impact on further education or training, which suggests that these variables exert weak influence over the decisions of students in pursuing more education or training. The model provides valuable lessons to career counselors, policymakers, and universities who wish to foster additional education and career advancement in the green economy and the field of sustainability.</p>

          <p>Additional diagnostic tests were conducted in response to the regression model's analytical requirements in order to confirm that the model complied with fundamental statistical assumptions and that the obtained coefficients were reliable. The purpose of these diagnostics was to check for heteroscedasticity or multicollinearity among the predictors, evaluate residual normality, and look for possible overfitting. To confirm the stability and dependability of the regression results shown above, these post-estimation checks had to be carried out. The distribution characteristics are summed up in the residual statistics that follow, which also verify that the model complies with the underlying assumptions.</p><p>Dependent variable: Likelihood to pursue further education or training related to the green economy and environmental policies after graduation.</p><p>The model's predicted and standardized residuals fall within acceptable ranges (-2.68 to 2.80), according to the residual statistics shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>, which also shows that there are no extreme outliers. A balanced distribution around the mean is shown by the standardized predicted values (-1.77 to 2.56), indicating consistent estimation across cases. The regression model satisfies the assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, and residual independence, as demonstrated by these findings in conjunction with the histogram and scatterplot diagnostics.</p>

            <title>4.4. Theoretical interpretation of regression findings</title>
          
          <p>It is crucial to comprehend how these findings represent the behavioral mechanisms that influence students' engagement with sustainability and the green transition, even beyond the statistical significance of the regression results. The interpretive framework that gives these relationships meaning is provided by theoretical reasoning; numbers alone cannot adequately explain why particular experiences and beliefs inspire students to take action. Therefore, the discussion that follows goes beyond coefficients to examine the interactions between important predictors of behavioral intention, including policy belief, educational exposure, and institutional trust, within the larger behavioral and awareness-based models that connect motivation, action, and cognition.</p><p>The general regression pattern supports the notion that social norms, perceived control, and individual attitudes interact dynamically to produce students' pro-environmental intentions. Students who exhibit greater faith in environmental regulations and the function of education in equipping them for sustainable changes are more likely to show that they are prepared to take action. This implies that attitudinal beliefs convert awareness into motivation and commitment when paired with experiential learning.</p><p>Students seem to feel more effective if they have been exposed to more environmental conversations and practical sustainability issues. This kind of exposure improves one's perception of one's own capacity to support sustainable solutions, demonstrating the crucial role experiential learning plays in converting awareness into behavioral intention. The findings also emphasize how crucial normative influence is. Students are more internally motivated to support these societal objectives when they think that organizations, laws, and policies are crucial in advancing sustainability. The interaction of awareness, belief, and perceived behavioral control demonstrates the multifaceted character of pro-environmental intention, where values direct responsible action and knowledge reinforce values. These results demonstrate that awareness to action is not a straight line, but rather follows a cognitive-behavioral continuum. Learning cultivates belief, which in turn influences motivation, which in turn influences behavioral intention. This all-encompassing connection between knowledge, institutional trust, and individual empowerment highlights how important higher education is in developing future professionals who care about the environment.</p><p>The symmetrical distribution of the residuals is confirmed by the histogram of standardized predicted values as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, which shows a roughly normal distribution centered around zero. The reliability of the regression estimates is supported by the smooth bell-shaped curve, which shows that the assumption of normalcy is met.</p>

          <p>The argument that the Likert-scale questions are well-designed and dependable for capturing the intended constructs is further supported by this value and the Cronbach's Alpha Based on Standardized Items of 0.827. A Cronbach's Alpha value above 0.70 is generally regarded as acceptable, with values nearer 1.0 denoting stronger reliability, per generally accepted guidelines.</p><p>The study's high Cronbach's Alpha indicates that the Likert-scale items' responses are consistent, indicating that the questions accurately gauge the underlying elements they are designed to evaluate, such as students' attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge of the green economy. The robustness of the conclusions derived from the survey is supported by this reliability, which guarantees that the findings are founded on reliable and valid data. A thorough grasp of the variables under investigation is also made possible by the Likert-scale design, which offers a nuanced assessment of students' attitudes and perceptions through its structured response options. This improves the data's overall quality and supports the findings regarding students' awareness and intentions regarding the green economy.</p><p>Cronbach's Alpha = 0.827: It is close to the original alpha and a great indication that even when the items are standardized, the internal consistency remains strong.</p><p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> presents the inter item statistics.</p>

Although students are reasonably confident and well-informed, there is still opportunity for more in-depth understanding and more robust educational support, according to the mean scores, which primarily fall between 2.3 and 2.8. Furthermore, the standard deviation values, which are primarily less than 1, indicate that participant responses are generally consistent, bolstering the scale's internal consistency and dependability.

          <p>The degree of consistency and relationship between various items (questions) within a scale or section of a questionnaire is evaluated using the inter-item correlation matrix. It aids in figuring out whether the items measure related underlying constructs. The matrix in this study is used to assess how closely students' answers relate to one another in terms of their knowledge, comprehension, and attitudes toward sustainability, the green economy, and environmental policies. Both high and moderate correlations show that the items are in agreement and add to the scale's overall dependability.</p><p>Item 3 (“I am aware of environmental policies and their impact on the local economy”) and Item 4 (“I understand the role of international organizations in addressing global environmental issues and the green economy”) have the strongest correlation at.591.

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>The study's findings shed important light on the variables influencing students' objectives to continue their education in environmental policy and the green economy. The results of this study are consistent with the larger body of research that highlights how important environmental education is in influencing students' perspectives on sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>]. Moderate student awareness of environmental policies has also been found in similar studies conducted in other developing nations, indicating that this is a general problem in transitional education systems rather than a context-specific one. Yet, the comparatively high level of confidence in students' comprehension of global issues might point to a discrepancy between perceived and real readiness, a problem that has also been brought up in research from Eastern Europe and Central Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">61</xref>]. Significantly, this study fills a research gap in the case of Kosovo, as no previous study has systematically evaluated students' knowledge of environmental policies, sustainability-related legal frameworks, and green economy principles. As such, it offers unique empirical data from a post-conflict and developing nation, providing insights into how Kosovo's future generations view and approach the green transition. This local viewpoint emphasizes the need for context-specific educational interventions and deepens the global conversation on sustainability education.</p><p>Based on the tested hypotheses, the results show a strong correlation between students' likelihood of pursuing higher education in this area and their understanding of global economic challenges, their perception of the significance of governmental policies, and their exposure to environmental issues during their studies. This section will outline possible directions for future research in advancing sustainability education, examine the findings' implications for higher education institutions, and discuss the findings in light of the body of existing literature. We hope to shed more light on the elements that influence students' involvement in the green economy and how educational systems can better equip them for the global green transition by analyzing the results' practical applicability.</p>

            <title>5.1. Hypothesis testing</title>
          
          <p>Hypothesis 1: Students' propensity to seek additional education in sustainability and environmental policies is significantly predicted by their level of knowledge and confidence in their comprehension of the issues facing the global green economy.</p><p>Supported by Findings: Students who demonstrate greater confidence in their comprehension of the global green economy's challenges are substantially more likely to continue their education in this area, according to the regression results (<inline-formula>

</inline-formula> = 0.155, p = 0.000).</p><p>These relationships' statistical significance emphasizes how crucial it is to improve policy awareness and instructional content in higher education in order to produce a generation ready for the green transition.</p><p>According to the Environmental Literacy Framework, which emphasizes four essential elements—environmental knowledge, affect, cognitive skills, and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_62">62</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">63</xref>]. students in Kosovo showed a moderate level of awareness regarding environmental policies and the role of the green economy, reflecting gaps in both knowledge and applied behavior. This supports the idea that educational programs should actively develop cognitive and behavioral competencies in addition to theoretical content. Furthermore, students' intentions to pursue higher education and green careers are meaningfully explained by the Theory of Planned Behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">64</xref>]. Positive attitudes and perceived behavioral control are important drivers of intention, as evidenced by the strong correlation found between students' confidence in their comprehension of global challenges and their willingness to relocate or work in environmental institutions. However, unless addressed through focused curriculum reforms, the majority of respondents' reported lack of formal exposure to green economy content may erode these behavioral intentions.</p><p>By providing insights that both complement and deviate from previous research, this study adds to the expanding conversation on green transition and sustainability education in developing and transitional economies. Studies carried out in Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans frequently show that students lack environmental literacy and that sustainability is not sufficiently incorporated into higher education curricula such the study from Nedanovski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">65</xref>] reveal that barriers that may arise on the supply side of green skills are connected to the vocational learning and development framework. In specific instances, the national education framework demonstrates the necessity. for further educator training initiatives concerning particular abilities. Furthermore, there should be requirements for training that need to be addressed. In addition, study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">66</xref>] emphasize that the green jobs creation and its development should be the national priorities in case of the North Macedonia as a country of the Western Balkans.</p><p>Additionally, study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">67</xref>] concluded that theWestern Balkan countries as a result of the informal sector, face another challenge and difficulties on the road towards environmental impacts. In general, education and training focused on green skills in Europe are also still developing, yet innovations within Member States and at the EU level provide valuable insights, such as the importance of including health and care workers along with their organizations, actively involving communities, and requiring providers to implement sustainable practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_68">68</xref>].</p><p>The greatest difficulties across all pillars concluded in the report by Djatkov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_69">69</xref>] in the case of the Western Balkans, are deficiencies in capacities of various types and at every level; limited public awareness; minimal enforcement of regulations; inadequate collaboration among entities and interests throughout the sectors; absence of funding mechanisms (currently); and absence of political determination. In general, it is suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">70</xref>] for the Western Balkans to create initiatives and implement required measures to enhance administrative capabilities for execution of the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans to oversee, advocate and implement adherence to environmental requirements and guarantee efficient systems for community involvement, availability of information, availability of legal recourse in environmental issues and ecological accounting. This discrepancy implies that the youth of Kosovo offer a new avenue for curriculum development and policy intervention. This study fills a significant gap in the literature by documenting students' perspectives and goals, especially in settings where formal environmental education is still in its infancy.</p>

          <p>These findings have significant ramifications for policymakers and institutions of higher learning. First and foremost, curriculum designers ought to include more structured material on legal frameworks, environmental governance, and the global-local dynamics of sustainability. Second, collaborations between academic institutions and government agencies could be promoted to give students hands-on experience with green jobs and environmental policymaking. Furthermore, combining economics, law, and environmental sciences through interdisciplinary approaches may improve sustainability education's efficacy and better equip students to handle challenging real-world situations.</p>

          <p>The theoretical framework suggests possible indirect pathways, even though the current study focused mostly on direct relationships between education-related variables and students' behavioral intentions toward green learning. In particular, the relationship between educational exposure and students' intentions to pursue additional green studies may be conceptually mediated by constructs like policy belief and environmental awareness. </p><p>Students are more likely to convert their knowledge into behavioral intentions if they gain greater awareness and confidence in the relevance of policies through education. </p><p>Future studies should use mediation or moderation modeling, such as structural equation modeling (SEM) or PROCESS-based analyses, to validate the indirect effects of awareness and policy belief within the larger behavioral framework, even though the current dataset and design concentrate on direct effects.</p><p>Even though the primary focus of this study was on the direct relationships between students' behavioral intentions toward green learning and education-related factors, the theoretical model suggests that these effects may be conceptually mediated by variables like environmental awareness and policy belief. When students are exposed to sustainability-related education, they are more likely to believe that government policies are important, which may increase their desire to further their education in the green economy.</p><p>Nevertheless, formal mediation and moderation analyses were not performed in this study. In order to determine the degree to which awareness and policy beliefs serve as mediators between education and intention, such indirect pathways should be empirically tested in future studies using structural equation modeling (SEM) or PROCESS-based methodologies.</p><p>Although the study offers insightful information, it must be noted that it has certain limitations. Due to the sample's preponderance of Faculty of Economics students, responses may be biased toward economic viewpoints on sustainability, possibly underrepresenting opinions from technical, environmental, or legal fields. Furthermore, subjectivity and possible social desirability bias are introduced by the use of self-reported Likert-scale responses. This model should be expanded in future studies by looking at possible mediating and moderating factors, especially the indirect effects of policy awareness and belief on students' intentions to engage in green learning.</p><p>Future research should examine longitudinal data to evaluate how student perceptions change over time and across educational levels in order to build on the findings of this study. A more comprehensive understanding of educational gaps and policy needs may be obtained through comparative cross-country studies conducted in the Western Balkans or other developing regions. Furthermore, more studies might examine the ways in which exposure to real-world experiences—like internships, environmental simulations, or project-based learning—affects students' preparedness to participate in the green economy.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The findings of the statistical analysis highlight the essential role of education and training in preparing young generations to tackle the issues of climate change and transition to a green and sustainable economy. The results indicated that various factors influenced the probability of seeking further education or training in this field, predominantly including predictors such as confidence in grasping global economic issues, belief in the importance of governmental policies for green transitions, and previous experience with environmental challenges through education. The study shows that people who trust their knowledge of global economic issues related to the green economy, those who think government involvement is essential for a green transition, and those who studied environmental topics in academic programs are more inclined to seek further education or training in green economy areas. These results indicate that education is crucial for enabling participation and involvement in sustainable development initiatives. </p><p>Given that the current world is confronting significant issues like climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss, it is crucial for future generations to tackle these problems and help find solutions. Green transition and sustainable economic development require people who are well-educated and well-trained to face challenges. Education and training in the green economy is required to develop future experts who will have the capacity to provide sustainable solutions to improve economic and environmental conditions. In this context, education provides for extensive knowledge in areas such as renewable energy, natural resource management, and sustainable environmental policy, to enable balanced and sustainable development of the economy and society. Also, continuous training in climate change and green economic development provides individuals with skills and opportunities to apply theoretical principles in the practice field, positioning them for key positions in public, private, and international organizations that focus on environmental policy and the green economy. Training also helps develop social awareness and motivate commitment towards supporting sustainable development, for instance, taking steps to prevent environmental crises and raise living standards. An integral aspect of this is developing confidence and capability in working on global problems, such as resource management and environmental protection, providing professional career and opportunities within the green economy. This is an opportunity to assist in saving the world and helping to make the planet more sustainable for all future generations. In short, education and training are the two cornerstones that will empower the young generations to conquer the climate change challenges and create a green and sustainable economy. It is an opportunity to take a positive role towards the future and enjoy a healthier world and sustainable development for all. However, there were some of the variables such as gender and study level that did not influence the likelihood of pursuing additional education, thereby suggesting that individual interest, information, and perceived opportunity in green economy profession are more decisive. In summary, what the findings of these results tell us is that education and lifelong learning are very important in preparing future professionals who will be central to addressing climate change challenges and developing a green, sustainable economy. It can be through increased awareness as well as knowledge where education should play an important role in unfolding these global challenges to enable future generations to build a sustainable and resilient future. The results indicate that individuals educated on environmental topics are more inclined to pursue further learning and training in the green economy.</p><p>Thus, Kosovo needs to prioritize incorporating sustainability and green economy issues into the curriculum of all levels of education, from primary school to university. This would go a long way in raising youth awareness about environment issues, such as climate change, resource erosion, and extinction of biodiversity, and equip them with the right knowledge for future sustainability. </p><p>The green economy clearly requires specialized expertise. Kosovo can initiate and promote additional vocational training and advanced education programs in specialized fields such as green technologies, sustainable farming, renewable energy, environmental regulations, and climate change mitigation. Programs can equip the youth for the upcoming job sector in the green economy, providing them with the necessary skills to tackle environmental issues.</p><p>The study highlights the importance of government policies in facilitating a green economy. Kosovo can encourage interagency collaboration and cooperation between government agencies and schools to align academic programs with national environmental policies and goals. This can be achieved through internships, training programs, and joint projects that allow students to gain practical experience in the green economy sector. </p><p>The study indicates that confidence in grasping global economic issues related to the green economy serves as a primary driver for seeking additional education and training. Kosovo needs to allocate resources for public awareness initiatives that educate its population, particularly the younger generation, on climate change, sustainable development, and the green economy These campaigns can also inspire the contribution of education to addressing these issues and encourage individuals to obtain further training. The findings indicate that individuals who believe there are sufficient career opportunities in the green economy are more likely to pursue related education and training. Therefore, Kosovo should come up with incentives for organizations and businesses to invest in the green economy sector, including renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture. Through the promotion of an environment-friendly scenario for green companies, Kosovo will be able to stimulate the creation of jobs and make youth see tangible career prospects in such industries. Kosovo should engage in global cooperation and knowledge-sharing experiences on climate change and sustainable development. By aligning itself with current advanced nations and organizations in the form of green economy practices, Kosovo can tap into co-shared know-how, best practices, and sources of finance to enable training and education in the green economy for future leaders. From the analysis, it is evident that those who are willing to move for a career in environmental sustainability will be more inclined to acquire additional education. Kosovo can offer funding or incentives for students to get international exposure or move for internships and employment in the green economy sector. This would improve their skill sets as well as impart global knowledge exchange regarding sustainability practices.</p><p>The study's findings indicate that students' desire to seek further education in sustainability and the green economy is greatly shaped by their comprehension of global economic issues, their recognition of environmental problems, and their conviction about the importance of government policies. The research did find certain aspects where students may exhibit overconfidence, particularly regarding the law's involvement in environmental issues.</p><p>Drawing on these results, several recommendations can be proposed to enhance the effectiveness of sustainability education and equip students with the tools necessary to make a meaningful impact on the green transition.</p><p>It is recommended that universities in Kosovo and other developing countries integrate sustainability-focused topics into their curricula, as exposure to environmental matters significantly impacts students' engagement with the green economy. This may include starting or expanding courses on biodiversity, climate change, green economy principles, and environmental protection regulations. Additionally, combining environmental studies, economics, and law through interdisciplinary methods may offer a deeper insight into sustainability.</p><p>Improve University Programs' Teaching of Government Policy According to the results, students are more likely to seek additional education in this field if they think that government policies are essential to the green transition. As a result, academic institutions ought to think about enhancing their emphasis on teaching environmental policy. Offering specialized courses on environmental law, climate governance, and the role of government in sustainable development could be one way to achieve this. Working together with governmental and non-governmental organizations may also yield useful case studies and insights to enhance the educational process.</p><p>Enhance Employment Prospects in the Green Economy Universities should strengthen the connections between their academic programs and opportunities in green jobs, as students have shown notable enthusiasm for sustainable industries. This can be accomplished by partnering with environmental groups, offering internships at sustainable companies, and delivering career advice centered on the growing demand for green jobs. Career fairs and networking opportunities with experts in the sustainability field may improve students' shift from education to jobs in eco-friendly industries.</p><p>Students' readiness to participate in the global green transition is indicated by their willingness to move for green job opportunities. By offering resources that assist students in investigating global career pathways in sustainability, universities could further support this. Students may be exposed to international environmental policies and practices through exchange programs, internships overseas, and collaborations with foreign institutions, which would improve their capacity to support the green economy globally.</p><p>There is a need to better bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, as evidenced by the negative correlation found between students' likelihood of pursuing further education and their confidence in their comprehension of the role of law in global environmental issues. It is advised that academic institutions create hands-on workshops or modules that highlight the use of legal frameworks in actual environmental situations. Students can acquire useful skills that will equip them for careers in environmental law and policy by participating in case studies and problem-solving activities.</p><p>Although this study provides insightful information, more investigation is required to examine the long-term effects of sustainability education on professional outcomes. Future research could look into how well students apply their green economy education to their careers and how colleges can better monitor and assist recent graduates who are employed in the green industry. Furthermore, more study could be done on the variables influencing students' opinions of green economy employment prospects, especially in developing nations.</p>
