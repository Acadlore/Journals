      <abstract><p>In the realm of global economics, tourism emerges as a pivotal sector, demanding strategic planning and policy formulation for sustainable development. The prosperity of tourism destinations is contingent upon the inclusivity of stakeholder perspectives, especially those impacted by the tourism industry. While substantial research has delved into local residents' perceptions of tourism development, the viewpoints of foreign residents remain conspicuously underexplored. This oversight necessitates an investigation into the nuanced impacts of tourism development, particularly within the Chinese context. A comprehensive questionnaire survey was administered to gauge the perceptions of overseas residents regarding tourism development in Qingdao, a prominent tourist locale in Eastern China. Findings indicate that perceptions among this demographic are heterogeneous, influenced by factors such as age, income, and personal affiliations with the tourism sector. It is demonstrated that the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental impacts of tourism are perceived variably, contingent upon these demographic variables. This analysis underscores the importance of integrating diverse resident perspectives into tourism planning and policy-making, to foster sustainability in tourism destination development. Such an approach is essential for aligning tourism development with the expectations and well-being of both local and foreign residents, thereby ensuring the long-term viability of tourism destinations. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by filling a critical gap in understanding the impacts of tourism development from the perspective of overseas residents in Qingdao, thus offering valuable insights for stakeholders in crafting inclusive and sustainable tourism strategies.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Since the 1950s onwards, tourism has been an essential driver for the economic development of many regions. As a result of being exposed to the numerous beneficial or harmful consequences of tourism development, the locals of a destination experience significant changes. As a result, it has been determined that locals should be included in the decision, making tourism and destination development processes critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">Badri &amp;amp; Yarmohamadi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">Crompton, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">Hartman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The rapid global growth of tourism has had unavoidable consequences for host communities' perceptions and attitudes toward the industry's development. There has been a significant increase in interest in residents and their perceptions of tourism and its development since the 1970s, giving rise to many experts and academics researching the residents' attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">Eyisi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_63">Šegota et al., 2024</xref>). In this context, an attitude tends to respond positively or negatively to a particular idea, object, person, or situation, which induces a person's reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">Hockenbury, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The economic, socio-cultural, and environmental consequences of tourism in general, as well as locals' perceptions of tourism impacts in particular, have long been studied by academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">Bagherzadeh Valami &amp;amp; Raeinojehdehi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">Nojehdehi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">Rasinojehdehi &amp;amp; Valami, 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, the significant volume and scope of research have primarily been directed toward the residents of a tourist destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">Gajdosik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">Pourmorshed et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_64">Šerić et al., 2023</xref>) and have almost entirely ignored the foreign residents who live in the same location.</p><p>Of course, this is understandable, as the particular reason for this circumstance can be attributed to the high likelihood of overseas residents comprising only a tiny fraction of the population in any given destination, who may also (for any reason) reside there temporarily. However, despite their smaller numbers and temporary status, each foreign resident likely has a considerable number of friends and relatives, or even, in their case, an active presence on social media platforms, followers, and viewers inside and outside of their home country and beyond. Therefore, it is not too farfetched to consider each of them as the representatives of their respective countries and cultures and as unofficial cultural ambassadors of the country and the city they reside in. Any aspect of their daily life or the major and minor events they experience can be shared with their friends, relatives, or audience and, as a result, have a promoting or demoting effect on the image of their place of residence.</p><p>Furthermore, these overseas residents likely know more about the likes and interests of other people in their respective countries and what they would find attractive in their current residence. Thus, their ideas and suggestions might be precious for future tourism planning and development of that location to attract more international tourists.</p><p>The researcher has chosen the coastal city of Qingdao, located in the Shandong province of the People's Republic of China, as the setting for this case study. The particular reasons for this decision are that Qingdao is a major tourist city on China's eastern coastline with a relatively high number of foreign residents, the importance observed (by the researcher) given to the city's image as an international city and its further internationalization by city officials and authorities, and the fact that the researcher himself is also, at the time of conducting the research, a resident in the city.</p><p>Qingdao is a beautiful seaside city in Shandong Province with about 730 kilometers of shoreline. The city lies 750 kilometers southeast of Beijing and is well known as a tourism destination and resort in China and internationally.</p><p>Qingdao's population is about 9.49 million, and its tourism industry is developing rapidly. Preliminary statistics show that the total number of tourists received in the city throughout 2019 was 109 million, an increase of 9% since 2018; the total tourism revenue was 195.59 billion Yuan, an increase of 13% since 2018. At the end of the year, there were 110 Aleve tourist attractions. Among them was one 5A-level tourist attraction, twenty-six 4A-level tourist attractions, and sixty-seven 3A-level tourist attractions. There are 98 star-rated hotels in the city, out of which there are nine 5-star hotels, twenty-four 4-star hotels, and sixty-two 3-star hotels. There are 575 travel agencies, among which 60 are operating outbound tourism businesses, and 515 are operating inbound and domestic tourism businesses (2019 Qingdao National Economic and Social Development Statistical Bulletin, March 2020).</p><p>The spatial and temporal characteristics of tourist mobility and the subsequent various socio-economic impacts are at the core of tourist flow research. As such, scholars have tried to explore the patterns of tourist flows but have, thus far, tended to focus mainly on the movement of tourists between attractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">Mou et al., 2020</xref>). Profiling Qingdao will add to the growing body of literature on important cities already documented, including Tianjin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">Leitmann, 1994</xref>), Baoji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_74">Wang &amp;amp; Hague, 1995</xref>), Chongqing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">Han &amp;amp; Wang, 2001</xref>), Shenzhen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_51">Ng, 2003</xref>), Guangzhou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_76">Xu &amp;amp; Yeh, 2003</xref>), Wuhan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">Han &amp;amp; Wu, 2004</xref>), Urumqi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">Dong &amp;amp; Zhang, 2011</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">Cullinane &amp;amp; Cullinane, 2003</xref>) and Macau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_66">Tang &amp;amp; Sheng, 2009</xref>). Taking 46 major tourist cities in China as a case, the vulnerability indices and main vulnerability-induced factors were analyzed using a comprehensive assessment model and a factor identification model. The results revealed several trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">Qin &amp;amp; Chen, 2022</xref>). In the study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_75">Wu et al. (2015)</xref>, it was investigated the measurement and comparative study of carbon dioxide emissions from tourism in typical provinces in China. Also in the study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_71">Wang et al. (2023)</xref>, it was investigated Spatial distribution and influencing factors of high-quality tourist attractions in Shandong Province, China. That Work Addressed two prime dimensions of tourism-related vulnerability assessment (i.e., sensitivity and responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">Cutter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">Guillaumont, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">Polsky et al., 2007</xref>) and refers to relevant indices from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">Huang et al. (2021)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_65">Sreya et al. (2021)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_72">Wang et al.

To determine tourist motivation and strategies of categorizing tourists with their beneficial stimulus fragmentation, multi-relational orientation models and multidimensional precedence scaling were used. Tourists are divided into distinct types in this infrastructure based on their trip stimulus. Different structures have been employed in tourism research on tourist motivation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> summarizes a number of research that look at a variety of factors in tourist motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">Bansal &amp;amp; Eiselt, 2004</xref>).</p>

      <p>The idea of this research came to the researcher's mind due to his interest in tourism development and his observations during his residency in Qingdao on how eager the public and private sectors and institutions in Qingdao are about promoting the city's international image and also how much sincere importance is being given by the government bodies, such as the Tourism and Culture Bureau of Qingdao city and the Tourism and Culture Bureau of Shandong, to its further internationalization via hosting numerous events and activities tailored and targeted specifically for foreigners in the town and the province.</p><p>The primary goal of this study is to learn more about the perceptions of the overseas residents in Qingdao regarding the impacts of tourism development and obtain their insights and ideas on how to refine and enhance the tourism development in Qingdao to further boost its international image and attractiveness as a tourism destination.</p><p>The findings of this study are intended to be used by local and regional authorities as well as the private and public sectors to evaluate and assess the current impacts of tourism development on overseas residents' daily lives and their perceptions and insights regarding how to refine further and tailor the development of tourism and other businesses in the city to attract more tourists, especially international ones.</p>

          <p>Data will be collected through an exploratory method via a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire will be delivered online and/or in a hand-delivered form(s) to the foreigners residing in Qingdao. The questionnaire will contain three main parts. The first part includes questions inquiring about the demographic background of the respondents, including gender, age, and nationality, type of residence, length of residency, level of income, their involvement in tourism, and so on. The second part of the questionnaire will contain 30 to 40 statements referring to the positive and negative impacts of tourism development in Qingdao. A five-point Likert-type scale will be used to measure the degree of the respondents' agreement or disagreements with the statements (in which a score of 1 represents "strongly disagree" and a score of 5 represents "strongly agree"). A score of "0" will mean "don't know" for avoiding the "filter effect" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">Hall, 2001</xref>). The third part of the questionnaire will have 1-2 questions for the respondents to communicate what they find attractive and unattractive about Qingdao as an international tourism destination. The partial least squares model (PLS), completed in two steps, will be the statistical method employed in this study. The validity of study outcomes in diverse sample quantities is the key advantage of this modeling method over other methods. It is straightforward to replicate a survey, and the questions can be answered quickly by people of all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">Aaker &amp;amp; Day, 1990</xref>). Two forms of logical validity and construct validity were studied in order to assess the questionnaire's validity, and content validity, apparent validity, and component validity (factor analysis) were examined in this respect. Composite tests and mean variance were used to determine convergent validity and correlation. Convergent validity and correlation of a structure need a reliability greater than 0.8 and a mean variance of at least 0.5. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The AVE index indicates how much of the variance in the examined structure was influenced by the structure's species. The AVE index, also known as convergent validity, is used to assess the validity of a structure. In this work, the combined reliability (CR) approach was employed to estimate structural reliability. In addition, Cronbach's alpha index is utilized to assess the structural reliability in this area. Therefore, the above indicators, along with the significant study of factor loads, were used to confirm the suitability of the types of structures. Factor loads greater than 0.4 have good validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">Fornell &amp;amp; Larcker, 1981</xref>). In a cautious approach, operating loads greater than 0.7 have good validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">Hulland, 1999</xref>). In general, if the value of t is greater than 1.96 times, the factor at the level of 0.05 is significant and approved. The correlation value of the questions of a variable with that structure is used to determine factor loads. If this number is equal to or more than 0.4, the variation between the variable and its questions is greater than the variance of the structure's measurement error. The measurement model's reliability is satisfactory. The crucial thing here is that if the researcher encounters values less than 0.4 after computing the factor loads between the structures and the questions, he must amend the question or eliminate it from the study model. The factor load indicates the strength of the link between the factor (the hidden variable) and the visible variable.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>, the presented information delineates the research variables under scrutiny, the corresponding measurable items utilized for assessment, the sources from which data were derived, and the factor loads associated with each variable.</p>

              <p>Several criteria are employed to assess the fit of the study structural model, the first and most fundamental of which is the t-statistic. The significant number t is the most fundamental criterion for assessing the link between variables in the model (the structural portion). If the sum of these figures is more than 1.96, the connection between the variables is true, and the hypotheses are confirmed. The research has a 0.95 confidence level. At a confidence level of 0.95, 0.05 acknowledges the link between variables. Naturally, statistics only reveal the link's validity; the relationship's intensity between the variables cannot be measured with them. The standardized coefficient can be used to understand the intensity of the relationship and compare it with other relationships (relationships in the model). According to the interpretative model in structural equation modeling, if the t-statistic of a path is larger than 1.96, the corresponding path is significant at the 95 percent level. Hence, all of the research hypotheses are verified in this study.</p><p>Examination of the indicators of the final research model also shows the high validity of the model. As a result, according to model approval, we report the results of path analysis in the form of a research model shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>.</p><p>Significance coefficients t (t-value):</p><p>Several criteria are used to evaluate the fit of the confirmatory factor model of the research, the first and most basic of which are the coefficients of significance t or t-value. The most basic criterion for measuring the relationship between factors in the model is the significant number of t. If the value of these numbers exceeds 1.96, it indicates the correctness of the relationship between the factors and thus confirms the research hypotheses at a confidence level of 0.95. Of course, it should be noted that numbers only show the correctness of the relationship, and the intensity of the relationship between the factors cannot be measured by them.</p>

          <p>The quality and fit of the model are measured using numerous ways in the partial least squares (PLS) methodology.</p><p>Determination coefficient R<sup>2</sup> (R squared). </p><p>The coefficients R<sup>2</sup> connected to the model's endogenous (dependent) latent variables are the first criterion for analyzing the structural model. R<sup>2</sup> is a criterion that demonstrates the influence of an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable and is used to connect the measurement and structural parts of structural equation modeling. And the criteria values for weak, medium, and strong values are 0.19, 0.33, and 0.67, respectively. The more R<sup>2</sup> is connected to a model's endogenous structures, the better the model fits. In a model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">Henseler et al. (2009)</xref> argue that if one or two foreign structures impact an endogenous structure. R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.33 and higher show the strength of the association between that structure and endogenous structures. R<sup>2</sup> grows as there are more independent variables. As a result, the more independent variables are used to describe a dependent variable, the higher the R<sup>2</sup> value is required to fit the model. It's worth noting that the value of R<sup>2</sup> is determined only for the model's dependent (endogenous) structures; the value of this criterion is zero for exogenous structures. And it shows how an external variable affects an endogenous variable. For the proposed model, R<sup>2 </sup>and adjusted R<sup>2</sup> are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>.</p>

      <title>4. Discussion and conclusion</title>
      <p>Data collected from overseas residents of the historical city of Qingdao was compared to examine the mediating role residents' perceptions of tourism impacts play in shaping the relationships between influencing factors and support for tourism development. In doing so, this study combined SET and WTSFR to provide an overarching framework to better understand foreign residents' perceptions of tourism development and their support for it. As such, the findings correspond with results from similar previous studies, many of which have been conducted in different cultural settings. The validity and reliability of the projected model of the path relationships among factors influencing residents' perceptions and the mediating role of residents' perceptions of and support for tourism development were supported for most hypotheses. These results reinforce the propositions of SET and confirm the positive, significant effect of residents' perceptions on their support for tourism development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">Almeida García et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">Andereck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">Hall &amp;amp; Page, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_70">Vareiro et al., 2013</xref>). Prior studies argue that residents who perceive more positive tourism impacts will support tourism development, while residents who perceive less positive tourism impacts are less likely to support tourism development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_53">Nunkoo &amp;amp; Ramkissoon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">Rasoolimanesh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_61">Rasoolimanesh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_77">Yazdani et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the results of the current study are consistent with prior research, signifying the positive and significant effect of RP on SUP in Qingdao. Thus, the results contribute toward a better understanding of the exchange process identified by SET, as recognized across the tourism development discourse.</p><p>The data analysis showed that some community members are disinclined toward the effects of tourism. For example, their disturbances related to environmental impacts and some social and cultural effects are significant. The negative effects of tourism on the community cause a lower inclination in society to participate in tourism development programs. However, its positive effects result in increasing their support and reaching the goals of the projects. Regarding Qingdao City, it seems that the benefits from tourism have provided the required encouragement to participate in tourism development programs. The results related to correlation coefficients indicate a significant relationship between tourism's effects on the community and participation degree. In this paper, economic, social, and cultural factors are the most critical factors affecting community participation in tourism development programs. Knowing how tourism affects society and supporting community cooperation are essential to reinforcing the strengths and improving the weaknesses of tourism planning. To obtain this goal, it is necessary to communicate effectively between planners and the community to gain society's support. As mentioned in the introduction, the effects of tourism development differ in various societies. Therefore, the results obtained from this study can't be generalized to other societies with certainty. One of the biggest problems for this study was the unavailability of research on the effects of tourism development in China on foreign residents. This results in the lack of a criterion for comparing tourism development effects for a case model. This factor is effective in encouraging the participation of international society in tourism development programs. As a result, although the results of this study indicate a strong correlation between tourism development effects on the community and the degree of community participation in tourism development programs, to be certain of this issue and the factors that affect it requires more studies in the future.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the degree to which each variable positively or negatively affects the perceptions of foreign residents.</p><p>H1: The overall perception of the overseas residents in Qingdao regarding the tourism development in the city is positive.</p><p>H2: There is a strong link between tourist development's socio-cultural effects and how foreign residents perceive tourism development.</p><p>H3: There is a strong link between the economic consequences of tourist development and how foreign residents see tourism development.</p><p>H4: There is a significant association between the environmental impacts of tourism development and overseas residents' perceptions of tourism development.</p><p>Previous research looked at the impact of influencing variables on citizens' perceptions and support for tourist growth. To our knowledge, however, the mediating impact of residents' views remains under-explored. Few research studies compare the direct effects of influencing variables on tourist development support and their indirect implications through people's perceptions of tourism development. As a result, this is the study's main theoretical contribution. The findings demonstrated that when citizens' perceptions are used as a mediator, the direct impacts of influencing variables on support for tourism development are larger than their indirect effects. This theoretical discovery contradicts previously held beliefs by emphasizing the relevance of the direct effects of influencing variables on tourism development support. The investigation was undertaken online to cross-validate the data using the recently invented MGA approach, another noteworthy addition. The political, economic, and cultural existence of places outside the tourism context means that tourism destinations have a more comprehensive meaning potential than most other consumer products and meanings that are closely tied up with the present and historical relations between the country of origin of the tourist and that of the destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_67">Therkelsen, 2003</xref>). A tourist destination may be viewed as an amalgam of individual products and experiences that combine to form the total experience of the area visited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Ekinci &amp;amp; Hosany, 2006</xref>). Past research has demonstrated that the destination image has both cognitive and affective components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Ekinci &amp;amp; Hosany, 2006</xref>). Although destination images have been found to consist of both affective and cognitive components, past research has also shown a direct connection between a destination’s image and the trend of tourists recommending it through word of mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">Ekinci &amp;amp; Hosany, 2006</xref>) and also a direct connection between the destination’s image and tourist’s expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>). The first category, which mainly motivates the tourist option, influences the potential customers’ motivation. It consists of natural attractions, built attractions, cultural attractions, and social attractions (e.g., way of life and local habits, language, and social interactions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>). The second category, represented by the services and facilities available at the destination, encourages tourists to check in and enjoy the attractions. In this category, we can include: accommodation, restaurants, local transport (taxis, buses, bike rentals, and other facilities), services and infrastructure for practicing certain sports (skiing schools, navigation, golf clubs, and stadiums), shops, tourist agencies, beauty salons, and spas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>). Ease of access determines, in most cases, the cost and speed for a tourist to reach a certain destination. In this third category, we include: general infrastructure (roads, parking places, airports, train stations, ports, and aqueducts), transport equipment (size, speed, and offer), operational factors (operated routes, service frequency, tariffs), and government regulation for transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>). The fourth category refers to the image and attitude tourists have concerning a tourist destination. Such factors are not necessarily connected with the previous tourist experience or any other objective arguments, but these factors are considered very powerful motivators in the tourism industry. Each destination has an image, but most times this is based on past events, and it doesn’t regard the present. This is why it is considered a very important destination marketing objective to sustain, demolish, or build images that influence potential customers’ perceptions and expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>). The last category is the price a client has to pay. This determines which products and services will be chosen, but it is also influenced by other factors, including season and desired services. From an international products’ perspective, influencing factors are also exchange rates and transport methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">Middleton, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The image of Qingdao, as seen by current visitors and residents, was gathered through a questionnaire survey that required the rating of predetermined cognitive and affective attributes and content analysis of responses to questions about the various impacts of tourism on the lives of foreign city residents. These findings also support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">Echtner &amp;amp; Ritchie (1991)</xref> claim that the measuring methods used impact the capacity to capture distinct aspects of an image construct. Multiple methodologies (both structured and unstructured) should be used to measure the destination image. Rating scales may assess cognitive and emotive images to offer a standardized knowledge of Qingdao's image regarding the city's strengths and flaws. At the same time, free answers can highlight the aspects that respondents find particularly important.</p>

            <title>4.1. Methodological considerations regarding image assessment</title>
          
          <p>Tourism growth is usually regarded as being warmly received by foreign residents of Qingdao. This favorable perception may alter over time as tourism develops, since a larger number of visitors may cause more significant challenges. Because most respondents could not directly relate their difficulties in Qingdao to tourism, some common concerns in metropolitan areas, such as traffic congestion and rising prices, emerged; however, they were not seen as solely the result of tourism. Related expansion. Due to tourism development, foreign residents have not felt any incursion into local culture. This may be because Qingdao is such an international city with diverse cultures and nationalities. As a result, more research may be needed to determine if reactions to the characteristics addressed in this study remain constant or alter over time in response to increased tourism activities.</p><p>Researching and studying the impacts of tourism development on the residents of a tourism destination and inquiring about the residents’ ideas and opinions have long been practiced by tourism governments, destination development and management organizations, and academicians in order to learn how the lives of the people have been impacted by tourism development and find out better ways to further develop tourism while making sure that it is sustainable. Yet, most of these studies, by solely targeting the local residents of the tourism destinations, have mostly ignored the thoughts, ideas, and opinions of the foreign residents (residing in the same destination) regarding how their lives have been impacted by the development of tourism. Despite their smaller numbers and (most likely) temporary status as residents, the overseas residents of any given location are possibly already in contact with a considerable number of friends and relatives or even social media followers and viewers in their country of origin or beyond, and can, via word of mouth, have a direct and very effective role in promoting or demoting a tourism destination to the people outside of that location or country. Furthermore, the overseas residents of a tourism destination are more likely to have a better understanding of the interests and wants of the people of their own countries and what is appealing to them in that particular destination, and, therefore, the ideas and suggestions that they have can be crucial to the tourism destination development and management bodies that want to promote the destination and attract more (especially international) tourists to it while making sure that the whole process is as sustainable as possible. The city of Qingdao is a major tourism destination in the east of China. The public and private sectors, as well as the regional and provincial authorities, attribute a lot of importance to promoting it as an international city and further attracting more international tourism and businesses to it. Reaching out to and investigating how the current state of tourism has impacted the lives of its overseas residents, as well as what ideas, opinions, and suggestions they might have for the further tourism development of the city, can be a valuable step in planning the future development of the tourism of Qingdao in a more efficient and sustainable way. Future studies might use a sequential research strategy to guarantee that the properties acquired from projected pictures are evaluated as perceived image attributes. Because this study focuses on Qingdao, China, the findings can only be applied to the sample population. The findings, on the other hand, may benefit people who conduct studies in different settings and as sources for image comparison with other places. Other researchers may be able to utilize the methodology and survey instruments as a starting point.</p>
