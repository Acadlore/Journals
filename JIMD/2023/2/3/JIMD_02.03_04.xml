      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Disruptive technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>] have been changing the face of marketing for quite some time now. In today's rapidly changing world, new technologies are emerging at a breakneck pace, forcing marketers to adapt and evolve their strategies to stay ahead of the curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. One of the most significant disruptive technologies in marketing is AI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. AI can transform the marketing industry by providing powerful tools for data analysis, predictive modeling, and personalized marketing. For example, AI can help marketers create targeted advertising campaigns based on individual customer preferences and behaviors, leading to more effective marketing efforts and higher conversion rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>AI has evolved into a potent marketing tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. The ability of AI to analyze large quantities of data, make predictions, and automate routine tasks has transformed the design and execution of marketing campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. This paper will examine the function of AI in marketing and its impact on the industry. AI's ability to analyze data is one of the primary advantages of AI in marketing. With the assistance of AI, marketers can obtain insights into customer behavior, which can be applied to developing effective marketing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. AI can analyze data from social media platforms, for instance, to determine how consumers interact with a brand and its products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. This data can then be used to develop targeted advertising campaigns and customized consumer experiences.</p><p>AI also automates mundane duties, allowing marketers to devote their time to more strategic endeavors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. AI can create personalized email marketing campaigns, generate content, and recommend products to consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. By automating these duties, marketers can work more efficiently, and businesses save money by not hiring additional staff to complete them manually. AI's capacity to enhance the consumer experience is a significant marketing advantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Chatbots, for instance, are gaining popularity as a means for businesses to respond immediately to consumer inquiries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Chatbots utilize AI to comprehend natural language and provide appropriate responses, reducing the workload of customer service teams and enhancing response times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, AI can be utilized to optimize digital advertising campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. AI can determine the most effective ad targeting and messaging strategies by assessing past campaigns and identifying trends. This can result in more successful campaigns with increased conversion rates and return on investment. Nevertheless, the use of AI in marketing presents some obstacles. Privacy and security of consumer data are primary concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. As AI algorithms rely on data to function, there is a risk that sensitive consumer data could be exploited or exposed to security risks. This requires organizations to prioritize data security and regulatory conformance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>Another area for improvement is the possibility of over-reliance on AI. Although AI can automate routine tasks and provide valuable insights, it cannot replace human creativity and intuition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. A greater reliance on AI could stifle innovation in marketing campaigns and limit the ability of businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive marketplace. To summarize, AI has become an indispensable marketing tool, providing insights, automating routine duties, and enhancing the customer experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. AI in marketing has enabled businesses to work more efficiently, make more informed decisions, and optimize their marketing efforts. However, there are obstacles to overcome, such as data privacy and security concerns and possibly overreliance on AI. To achieve the best possible results, businesses must balance AI and human creativity as the marketing field evolves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Researchers are looking to explore how Innovations in technology have an effect on businesses' ability to use their expertise to meet the demands of their customers and provide them with products and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Marketing research on digital and technology growth has moved at a breakneck rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. Research that has already been conducted in the marketing field is full of studies that analyze how various technologies can be applied to improve marketing performance and their respective consequences. However, research at the intersection of marketing and AI has only received more attention in recent years. Recent research requests have spurred increased investigation of AI-related subjects and their applications in marketing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. This has only begun to happen in the last few years. Keeping this in mind, we accept the concept of AI as "computational agents that act intelligently" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. This idea departs from conventional wisdom, which has traditionally held that the scope of AI is restricted to computers capable of displaying intelligence on par with that of humans. In this regard, we agree with the concept of marketing AI that states it is "the development of artificial agents that, given the information they have about consumers, competitors, and the focal company, suggest and/or take marketing actions to achieve the best marketing outcome" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>].</p><p>From a tactical point of view, AI is becoming an increasingly significant marketing component. Companies like Rare Carat, Google, Under Armor, and Spotify are among the growing number of businesses improving their performance by adopting AI-based platforms (such as IBM Watson Amazon Lex, or Google Assistant). This trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. This technique improves their market forecasting and automation and their contact with their customers across all of their marketing channels. Because of this, AI has been acknowledged as the most impactful technology for business, and its market value is projected to increase from \$10.1 billion in 2018 to \$126 billion by 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. A recent poll among business leaders indicated that one of the most critical areas for deploying AI in marketing and sales, with 24% of US organizations already utilizing AI and 60% projected to utilize it by 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>]. In addition, according to the workplace trends list compiled by SIOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], AI is seen as the most crucial development in the workplace.</p><p>Research has shown that the application of AI in marketing has been successful, with significant contributions appearing, particularly after 2017. After a period of relative quiet spanning over two decades, AI has recently acquired substantial attention in the scientific world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>]. This is even though academic interest in AI extends back to the 1980s, with an emphasis on expert systems and robotics. The rise of Big Data, improved access to processing power, and the evolution of AI approaches and technical enablers are the three primary elements ascribed to this revived interest in marketing among researchers and practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>]. The confluence of these elements is directly responsible for the rise in the popularity of AI in marketing over the past several years.</p>

                <title>3.1. 1 Customer relationship management (crm) fundamentals</title>
              
              <p> Customer relationship management, or CRM, refers to utilizing processes and systems to cultivate profitable and long-term connections with individual customers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. It is more expensive for organizations to gain new consumers than maintain relationships with the ones they already have. Thus it has grown increasingly vital in recent years. AI can assist in improving customer relationships by predicting which customers are most likely to respond to marketing activities. Customer relationship management (CRM) has emphasized using new technologies and approaches to achieve this goal. The usage of data that has been acquired and interactive features can help to promote customer relationships, as well as co-creation and co-production. AI is essential in translating data into marketing insights, with conversational agents demonstrating intelligence akin to humans, improving customer service and overall effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>].</p><p>It is crucial to consider two spectrums to describe AI's value inside CRM. These spectrums are the service encounter characteristics and the customer features that need to be regarded as permanent adjusters of conversational agents. Service encounters are essential to understanding how AI may help in various contexts, from customer profiling to CRM management activities, and ultimately optimizing the customer experience across all touchpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. These contexts include anything from customer profiling to CRM initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. The many stages of the sales funnel can benefit from advanced marketing intelligent systems, which can increase the customer lifetime value by boosting loyalty programs and one-to-one marketing activities.</p><p> It is essential to regularly update the data that has been collected in order to successfully manage interactions with customers and take into consideration the ongoing adaptation of bots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. An AI-powered credit card fraud detection system had difficulty keeping up with customers' unpredictable actions during the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the algorithms currently in place, specific customers were exhibiting peculiar consumption patterns regarding particular goods and services, which did not fit with the predicted behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. AI-powered marketing systems must modify and adapt when client behavior shifts, learning from new experiences and circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p>

              <p>The goal of marketing science is to understand and forecast the behavior of consumers regarding the items they purchase; however, the rise of new customers who are aware and demanding, combined with the pandemic of COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_44">44</xref>], has created extra obstacles for marketers. Using AI in conjunction with analyzing user data found on the internet, namely digital footprints and web facilities, can help develop successful goods and services. AI can recognize patterns of behavior and deliver insights, which can assist marketers in making strategic decisions and reducing the rate of customer turnover. To increase the number of times, potential customers use AI devices, these products must provide both practical value and a higher hedonic value. It has been determined that AI's influence on the so-called "psychology of automation" might lead to users becoming overconfident in the technology's capabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_45">45</xref>]. There is still a place for human judgment, and it is essential to ensure that AI is regarded as an ethical problem-solver requiring commitment from all hierarchical levels inside an organization. In order to make effective use of marketing tools that AI powers, those tools must be in line with customers' perceptions, and the managerial decision-making process should be founded on an effort to understand customers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>3.1. 3 Knowledge-based view</title>
              
              <p>The knowledge-based view, also known as the KBV, views knowledge to be an exceptional resource, one that may be either explicit or tacit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>]. Explicit knowledge can be easily passed on to others through systematic language, whereas tacit knowledge is more difficult to express and decode. Within the KBV, there has been a significant interest in knowledge integration, which refers to the process of applying or sharing specific knowledge to create new knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>]. Researchers have developed expert systems and other knowledge-intensive computer programs to manage knowledge and find solutions to issues. Knowledge management systems, often known as KMS, have been developed as a foundational component of AI. These systems provide the potential to ease the integration of knowledge. On the other hand, AI applications are typically better suited for acquiring explicit knowledge. On the other hand, tacit information, which can be acquired through experiential learning, insight, intuition, the senses, or implicit rules of thumb, constitutes a considerable barrier to the application of AI technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of this, AI applications have successfully acquired customer knowledge and enabled businesses to create meaningful content for customer journeys through marketing automation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. Predictive models' ability to analyze prospective customers' purchase propensity and find high-quality leads can contribute to increased marketing efficiency. Knowledge-based technologies, such as semantic computing, can infer conceptual and affective information linked with natural language, and natural language processing can also achieve gender classification of text [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>]. The KBV, on its whole, sheds light on the significant part that automation plays in producing, codifying, transferring, and applying knowledge. This, in turn, enables a more comprehensive awareness of the requirements and behaviors of consumers across all devices, platforms, and products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>].</p>

              <p>Networks are increasingly important in marketing and other disciplines due to their ability to explain social phenomena and their interdisciplinary nature. Networks consist of actors who have relationships or interactions with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>]. A node's position in a network determines its opportunities and constraints, which are vital to its outcomes. Centrality is a widely studied characteristic of networks that help identify a node's importance or prominence in a network.
