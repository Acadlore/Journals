      <abstract>In the realm of epidemiological modeling, the intricacies of epidemic dynamics are elucidated through the lens of compartmental models, with the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) and its variant, the SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) model, being pivotal. This investigation delves into both deterministic and stochastic frameworks, casting the SIR model as a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) in stochastic settings. Such an approach facilitates simulations via Gillespie's algorithm and integration of stochastic differential equations. The latter are formulated through a bivariate Fokker-Planck equation, originating from the continuous limit of the master equation. A focal point of this study is the distribution of extinction time, specifically, the duration until recovery in a population with an initial count of infected individuals. This distribution adheres to a Gumbel distribution, viewed through the prism of a birth and death process. The stochastic analysis reveals several insights: firstly, the SIR model as a CTMC encapsulates random fluctuations in epidemic dynamics. Secondly, stochastic simulation methods, either through Gillespie's algorithm or stochastic differential equations, offer a robust exploration of disease spread variability. Thirdly, the precision of modeling is enhanced by the incorporation of a bivariate Fokker-Planck equation. Fourthly, understanding the Gumbel distribution of extinction time is crucial for gauging recovery periods. Lastly, the non-linear nature of the SIR model, when analyzed stochastically, enriches the comprehension of epidemic dynamics. These findings bear significant implications for epidemic mitigation and recovery strategies, informing healthcare resource planning, vaccine deployment optimization, implementation of social distancing measures, public communication strategies, and swift responses to epidemic resurgences.</abstract>

      <p>In December 2019, Dr. Zhang Jixian notified Chinese authorities about the emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], which has infected 180 individuals in Wuhan, China. Europe witnessed a rapid escalation of the crisis as the year came to a close, with the first instances of the virus being reported in France, Italy, and Germany between January 24 and 29, 2020. The events that transpired led to the ongoing worldwide battle against the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p>The significance of the SIR model in the context of COVID-19 resides in its capacity to offer a simplified yet potent depiction of disease transmission throughout a community. The model specifically focuses on the susceptible-infectious-recovered compartments, aiding in the enhanced comprehension and estimation of the epidemic's progression. Here are few key factors that emphasize this significance:</p><p>(1) Projection of Epidemic Trends: The SIR model allows for projecting epidemic trends based on parameters such as the transmission rate and recovery rate. These projections can assist in anticipating the future spread of the disease and implementing preventive measures.</p><p>(2) Estimation of Key Parameters: By fitting the model to real-world data, it becomes possible to estimate key parameters such as the basic reproduction number (<inline-formula>

</inline-formula>, which, when taken out of context, often seemed ambiguous or specific to epidemiology.</p><p>Motivated by this context, our work delves into the dynamics of virus spread, presenting a model less complex than SARS-CoV-2 but providing an introduction to epidemiology and population behavior modeling during a viral epidemic. Epidemiological compartmental models, despite simplifying reality, offer an elegant framework to modulate the system's complexity, yielding qualitative and elementary insights [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>The mathematical study of epidemic dynamics experienced a resurgence during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This revival is crucial, not only for understanding and managing epidemics but also for informing political decisions at the authorities' level and influencing global public health affairs amid a growing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>Several questions propel this study. How can we comprehend epidemic dynamics? What determines an epidemic's persistence? How can we model interactions within a population? What will be the extent of the affected population? Epidemiology thrives on complexity, as individual interactions are inherently local and nonlinear. With a country's average population of $10^7$ individuals, considering all micro- and macroscopic variables influencing virus spread becomes impractical and illusory.</p><p>This is where the stochastic components come into play when modeling interactions between individuals. We will return to this point later.</p><p>Specifically, the aim here is to study the SIR model, which belongs to the class of compartmental models in epidemiology, from both a deterministic and a stochastic point of view. Within the framework of the stochastic study, we will study this model as being a continuous-time Markovian jump process, which we will be able to simulate using the Gillespie algorithm and from which we will be able to obtain the master equation. Then, we will take the continuous limit of this master equation in order to obtain a bivariate Fokker-Planck equation. Finally, we will study the distribution of the epidemic's extinction time, a central issue in epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>].</p><p>The study objectives can be formulated as follows:</p><p>(1) Explore Epidemiological Dynamics: Gain an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of disease spread, with a focus on transitions between the susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments of the SIR model.</p><p>(2) Evaluate the Adaptability of the SIR Model: Examine the SIR model's capacity to adapt to various epidemiological scenarios, including stochastic variability, to determine its robustness and applicability in real-world situations.</p><p>(3) Analyze stochastic aspects: deepen the stochastic analysis of the SIR model, highlighting the advantages of this approach over deterministic models and exploring how random fluctuations may influence outcomes.</p><p>(4) Understand the Extinction Time Distribution: Scrutinize the extinction time distribution in the context of the stochastic SIR model, emphasizing a comprehensive understanding of this distribution and its impact on the recovery duration of infected individuals.</p><p>(5) Contribute to the Optimization of Control Strategies: Provide practical insights and perspectives to refine disease control strategies by leveraging the results of the SIR model analysis, with a particular focus on implications for the management and prevention of epidemics.</p><p>The study's main goals are to improve our understanding of how diseases spread using the SIR model, see how well it can be used in different situations, look into random factors, figure out how long it takes for a disease to die out, and finally, make disease control strategies better.</p>

      <title>2. Unraveling epidemiological dynamics: exploring compartmental models in public health</title>
      <p>A concise chronicle. To conduct an analysis of an epidemic, it is necessary to have daily census data. This is the reason why the field of epidemiology is relatively new. The initial instances of mortality investigations conducted by D. Bernouilli can be dated back to 1766, during which his objective was to exert an impact on public policy about a vaccine technique (or its contemporary counterpart) in order to mitigate the propagation of smallpox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p>It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that more systematic work was produced to model the spread of diseases and viruses. Among these pioneers were R. Ross, W. H. Hamer, W. O. Kermack, and A. G. McKendrick, whose work in epidemiology was considerable between 1900 and 1935 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Ross won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1902 for studying and demonstrating the dynamics of the propagation of the malaria parasite between mosquitoes and humans. He showed that below a certain critical threshold, the mosquito population is no longer able to carry the parasite and thus produce an epidemic. Hamer is best known for studying and modeling the recurrent nature of measles epidemics, and in particular for showing that an epidemic must fortiori depend on the number of susceptible and infected individuals.</p><p>This was followed, between 1927 and 1933, by articles by Kermack and McKendrick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], which laid the foundations for compartmental models. The first compartmental diagrams appeared in their second article in 1932.</p><p>Principle: The idea is to segment the population into a certain number of compartments, each containing a certain number of individuals. A given individual can only be located in one and only one compartment. It can, however, be transferred to another bin according to a certain transfer rate or transition rate (which may depend on the individual chosen or the size of the population, for example). Its state is then modified. Depending on the model, the total population may or may not be retained. The latter case takes into account the death or birth of individuals.</p><p>An epidemiological compartmental model is composed of two essential components: compartments and rules. The rules dictate the circumstances under which an individual might transition from one compartment to another. The selection of compartments is unrestricted and contingent upon the subject of investigation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> provides a comprehensive list of the compartments that are frequently utilized. It is important to mention that, due to clear reasons, a minimum of compartments S and I are necessary.</p><p>The greater the number of compartments, the more the system will illustrate complex interactions and be able to highlight fairly detailed behavior. Such systems are generally, if not always, non-analytical. On the other hand, a small number of compartments is often synonymous with a simple model, which most of the time omits details and remains qualitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Once the compartments and rules have been chosen, a reaction scheme can be associated with the model. Often complementary to the reaction diagram, it is also possible to construct a compartmental diagram, which in itself summarizes the entire model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, for example, illustrates the compartmental diagram of an SIRD model. In such a model, a healthy individual who comes into contact with an infected individual becomes infected himself. An infected individual can either die or recover.</p>

      <p>In practice. Compartmental models can be interpreted deterministically or stochastically. This flexibility increases their scope. For each of the deterministic models, however complex, it is possible to define a quantity, called the basic reproduction number, that defines the threshold between epidemic growth and decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>].</p><p>In particular, compartmental models are used to support political decisions: What will be the effects of a vaccine? A quarantine. As models, the results remain qualitative and cannot take into account unpredictable factors (environmental or economic catastrophe, civil war, etc.). However, they have already proved their worth for the spread of tuberculosis, AIDS, influenza, Ebola, and malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The global SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has given rise to a revival of compartmental models of all kinds, from the simplest to the most elaborate.</p><p>There has been a steady improvement in the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model in epidemiology in order to better show how complicated epidemiological dynamics are. The significance of this evolution lies in the improvement of model accuracy to better anticipate, understand, and control the spread of diseases. Here is a perspective on the evolution of the SIR model and its significance:</p><p>(1) Origins of the SIR Model: The SIR model was initially developed to describe infectious disease outbreaks by considering three population compartments—susceptible, infectious, and recovered. It provided a simple yet powerful conceptual framework for understanding disease transmission within a population.</p><p>(2) Incorporation of Stochasticity: The recent evolution of the SIR model has included a more profound consideration of stochasticity, acknowledging that epidemiological phenomena may involve random elements. Stochastic SIR models better represent natural fluctuations in the spread of diseases.</p><p>(3) Spatial and Temporal Models: Variants of the SIR model have been developed to incorporate spatial and temporal elements, accounting for the mobility of individuals and geographical variations in disease transmission. This has strengthened the models' ability to predict spread on regional and national scales.</p><p>(4) Integration of More Complex Parameters: Advanced versions of the SIR model integrate more complex parameters, such as variable transmission rates, differentiated incubation periods, and specific subpopulations. This allows for a more realistic modeling of the diversity of epidemiological situations.</p><p>(5) Adaptation to Emerging Diseases: The evolution of the SIR model has been guided by the necessity to adapt to emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. Researchers continually adjust the models to make them relevant in specific epidemiological contexts.</p><p>The evolution of the SIR model underscores its constant adaptation to meet the growing challenges posed by the understanding and management of infectious diseases. This evolution enhances the relevance and applicability of the model in various epidemiological contexts, reinforcing its value as an essential tool for modeling and predicting epidemics.</p><p>The transition from deterministic models to stochastic models in epidemiology represents a fundamental shift in how we approach the modeling of infectious diseases. This transition is motivated by several factors and offers significant advantages. Here is a discussion on this transition and the underlying motivation for using stochastic models:</p><p>(1) Incorporation of Uncertainty: Deterministic models consider the spread of diseases as a predictable and deterministic process. However, in reality, many epidemiological variables involve an element of uncertainty. Stochastic models incorporate this uncertainty, allowing for a better representation of the random fluctuations observed in the transmission of diseases.</p><p>(2) Handling Small Populations: In small populations where random effects can have a significant impact, stochastic models are more suitable. They take into account the probability of disease extinction, which may not be considered in deterministic models.</p><p>(3) Exploration of Random Fluctuations: Stochastic models enable the exploration of inherent random fluctuations in epidemiological dynamics. This includes variations in the number of infections, the timing of epidemic events, and other factors that are challenging to predict deterministically.</p><p>(4) Precision in Complex Scenarios: In complex epidemiological situations, such as epidemics with variable social interactions, individual behavior changes, or public health interventions, stochastic models offer increased precision by considering inherent variability.</p><p>(5) Adaptation to Real Data: Real epidemiological data often exhibit unexpected variations. Stochastic models allow for the adjustment of parameters to better align with observed data, enhancing their ability to faithfully represent reality.</p><p>The adoption of stochastic models in epidemiology is a response to the necessity of accurately representing the uncertainty and variability inherent in the transmission of illnesses. This methodology offers a pragmatic and flexible viewpoint, empowering researchers and decision-makers to make well-informed choices in a wide range of intricate and varied epidemiological scenarios.</p>

      <p>Let's define each individual's role precisely.</p><p>Susceptible individual: an individual who has no immunity to the infectious agent and therefore becomes infected if exposed.</p><p>Infected individual: an individual who can transmit the infection to susceptible individuals if they come into contact.</p><p>Immunized individual: an individual who can no longer contract the infection and therefore no longer infects other individuals. This individual is passive.</p><p>This is known as the epidemic SIR model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Another version is the endemic SIR model, which deals with a disease/infection affecting a population on a permanent basis. The essential difference between the two lies in the time scales.

      <p>The stability analysis of the disease-free state in epidemiological models has significant practical implications for public health strategies and interventions. Here is a more detailed discussion of how the stability of this state translates into public health actions:</p><p>(1) Early Detection and Rapid Response:</p><p>A stable disease-free state suggests that, under certain conditions, the disease may not establish itself in the population. Early detection of outbreaks becomes crucial to prevent the transition to an endemic state. Public health strategies should focus on robust surveillance systems and rapid response mechanisms.</p><p>(2) Effective Vaccination Campaigns:</p><p>Stability analysis provides insights into the conditions for maintaining a disease-free state. This information is valuable for designing effective vaccination campaigns. Vaccination efforts can be targeted to enhance stability by ensuring a sufficiently high level of immunity in the population.</p><p>(3) Optimization of Resource Allocation:</p><p>Stability analysis helps understand the factors influencing disease dynamics. This knowledge enables the optimization of resources, such as healthcare facilities, staff, and medical supplies. Resource allocation can be adjusted based on the stability conditions of the disease-free state.</p><p>(4) Adaptation of Public Health Measures:</p><p>Public health interventions, such as quarantine measures, social distancing, and hygiene practices, can be adapted based on stability conditions. For diseases with a stable disease-free state, interventions can focus on preventing reintroduction from external sources.</p><p>These practical implications highlight the importance of stability analysis in guiding evidence-based public health strategies and interventions to effectively manage and control infectious diseases.</p>

      <title>4. Sir stochastic model of epidemics: from motivation to gillespie algorithm</title>
      <p>The work is contributive in the field of epidemiological modeling, particularly through the use of stochastic approaches such as the Gillespie model and the Fokker-Planck equation to study the dynamics of infectious diseases. These approaches allow for the consideration of uncertainty and random fluctuations, providing a realistic perspective on the spread of diseases.</p><p>Specifically, the use of the Gillespie model to simulate stochastic jump processes in the context of epidemics appears to be a significant contribution. Additionally, the analysis of the distribution of extinction time provides valuable insights into the dynamics of infectious diseases and may have important implications for public health.</p><p>Regarding improvements over existing models, the stochastic approach adopted here enables the capture of random variations in disease spread, which can be crucial in real-world situations. Furthermore, the transition to a Fokker-Planck equation in the continuous limit offers an analytical perspective on system behavior, which can be advantageous compared to purely numerical approaches.</p><p>It would also be relevant to highlight how these new approaches can be applied to real epidemiological data and how they compare to more traditional deterministic models in terms of accuracy and predictive ability.</p><p>The work brings forth original ideas and extends the scope of epidemiological modeling by introducing stochastic elements and in-depth analytical analysis.</p><p>Complex systems are made up of a multitude of elements interacting according to the laws of the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. Therefore, it is totally unrealistic to model all these interactions. Predictions of the behavior of such systems are severely limited. The notion of fluctuation also comes into play: the evolution of a given observable cannot be rigorously monotonic, i.e., smooth. The large number of interactions necessarily diverges the evolution of the observable from that predicted by the equivalent deterministic model. It is in this sense that stochastic calculus takes on its full importance in the study of complex systems. In short, the emergence of a random dimension is based on the impossibility of knowing the behavior of a system down to the smallest detail. This lack of information can be modeled as noise with a given, postulated probability distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>].</p><p>This provides an initial motivation for the stochastic approach to epidemiological models. Moreover, stochastic models are important when the number of affected individuals is small compared with the population size or when transmission, infection, births, and deaths are highly variable. Other global variations, such as environmental ones, could also be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>].</p><p>Yes, the stochastic SIR model and the Gillespie algorithm are likely to have a substantial impact on the understanding of epidemic spread. Here are some reasons why these approaches are important:</p><p>(1) Incorporation of Uncertainty and Fluctuations: Unlike deterministic models, the stochastic SIR model takes into account the inherent uncertainty in epidemiological processes. It models random fluctuations in disease transmission, which is crucial in real-world scenarios where individual interactions cannot always be predicted with certainty.</p><p>(2) Realistic Simulation of Jump Processes: The Gillespie algorithm provides a realistic simulation approach for stochastic jump processes associated with disease spread. It captures discrete events such as contacts between individuals, infections, and recoveries, which can have a significant impact on epidemic dynamics.</p><p>(3) Analysis of Temporal Distributions: The use of stochastic models allows the analysis of temporal distributions, such as the distribution of the extinction time of the infection. This provides valuable insights into the temporal variability of epidemics and can help better understand factors influencing the duration of their spread.</p><p>(4) Consideration of Small Populations: Stochastic models, like the Gillespie model, are particularly useful when the number of affected individuals is small compared to the total population size. They can better represent situations where rare events have a significant impact.</p><p>(5) Complementary Approach to Deterministic Models: While deterministic models are useful for understanding general trends, stochastic models provide a complementary perspective by taking into account stochastic aspects and individual variations.</p><p>The stochastic SIR model and the Gillespie algorithm help us understand how epidemics spread better and more realistically by taking into account the unknown and inherent differences in how people interact and how epidemics happen.</p><p>The article establishes a connection between the mathematical development of the stochastic SIR model, the Gillespie algorithm, and the practical implications in the context of infectious disease spread. Here's how this work enhances our understanding of infectious disease propagation:</p><p>(1) Precision in Modeling: The stochastic SIR model captures random fluctuations and uncertainties inherent in individual interactions and epidemiological events. This enhanced precision contributes to a more realistic modeling of the spread processes.</p><p>(2) Realistic Simulation of Epidemic Processes: The Gillespie algorithm can be used to simulate stochastic jump processes, which gives a realistic picture of discrete epidemiological events like people coming into contact with each other, getting sick, and getting better. This enables an in-depth understanding of epidemic dynamics.</p><p>(3) Analysis of Temporal Distribution: Analyzing the distribution of infection extinction times provides crucial insights into the temporal variability of epidemics. Understanding the duration of spread and factors influencing extinction time contributes to better epidemic management.</p><p>(4) Study of Small Populations: The stochastic model is particularly relevant when the number of affected individuals is small compared to the total population size. This extends the model's applicability to realistic situations where rare events can have a significant impact.</p><p>(5) Integration of Stochastic and Deterministic Analysis: The stochastic approach complements deterministic models by offering a perspective that considers individual variations and uncertainties. This integration allows for a more holistic understanding of disease spread.</p><p>(6) Implications for Public Health: By better understanding epidemic dynamics through the stochastic model, health authorities can make more informed decisions regarding control strategies, resource allocation, and preventive interventions.</p><p>Thus, the work enriches our understanding by providing advanced mathematical tools while demonstrating how these tools can be applied to draw meaningful conclusions about infectious disease spread in the real world.</p><p>Nor is it more natural to define a probability of infection between two individuals rather than a mechanism by which infection does or does not occur? Stochastic calculus then offers the possibility of assigning uncertainties to the mean values of observables or to estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>].</p><p>Markov jump process: The variables <inline-formula>

      <p>Continuous limit and Fokker-Planck equation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. The idea here is to look at the master equation in the continuous limit in order to obtain the Fokker-Planck equation associated with the process. Recall that the Fokker-Planck equation is the equation that must be satisfied by the probability density of a system described by a continuous-time Markov process. As a result, it will be possible to associate a stochastic differential equation in the sense of Itô (or possibly in the sense of Stratonovich) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] with the Markov jump process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] and integrate its trajectories to obtain stochastic trajectories.</p><p>Let's put it this way,</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

      <p>Proof of this Theorem is based on a comparison of the leap process leading to extinction with a birth-and-death process. We will not demonstrate this Theorem here. However, we would like to discuss the emergence of the Gumbel distribution from a birth-and-death jump process. There are two processes that modify the number of infected individuals in the population. On the one hand, process (1a) increases the number of infected individuals by one, <inline-formula>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>We first talked about the history, general ideas, and real-world uses of compartmental models in epidemiology. Then we suggested a study of the SIR model that looked at both deterministic and stochastic factors. The analysis of the deterministic dynamics was summarized in Propositions 1 and 2. The deterministic dynamics of the SIR model with stochastic introductions have been summarized in Propositions 1 and 2. Proposition 1 establishes that, asymptotically, the number of infected individuals converges to a stable state, while Proposition 2 details the growth or decline behavior of the epidemic based on the reproduction parameter <inline-formula>

</inline-formula> in the emergence and control of epidemics, enhancing the understanding of the model dynamics.</p><p>After motivating the stochastic analysis, we considered the SIR model as a continuous-time Markov jump process, and we determined its master equation. Two methods were proposed to simulate stochastic trajectories. First, using the Gillespie algorithm, which we demonstrated, and second, using stochastic differential equations in the sense of Itô obtained from the bivariate Fokker-Planck equation. The latter was obtained through a continuous limit of the master equation. Finally, we investigated the distribution of extinction times, motivated by deterministic analysis. Firstly, a theorem obtained by A. D. Barbour was introduced. Secondly, a development explaining the emergence of a Gumbel distribution for the extinction time was proposed.</p><p>The study of the stochastic SIR model, the Gillespie algorithm, and the Fokker-Planck equation in the context of epidemics provides a powerful approach to understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases. These models accurately capture the uncertainty and fluctuations inherent in individual interactions and epidemiological events, offering a realistic perspective on the spread of diseases.</p><p>The Gillespie algorithm is used to implement the stochastic SIR model. This model simulates stochastic jump processes and gives a realistic picture of discrete epidemiological events. The analysis of temporal distributions, especially the extinction time of the infection, yields valuable insights into the temporal variability of epidemics.</p><p>Transitioning to the Fokker-Planck equation in the continuous limit provides an analytical description of the system's behavior. When you add diffusion terms to the Fokker-Planck equation, deterministic paths take on a random component. This shows how important randomness is, especially in small populations.</p><p>Analyzing the distribution of extinction times, whether through stochastic simulations or the Fokker-Planck equation, allows for quantifying the uncertainty surrounding the moment when an infectious disease disappears from a population. This deeper understanding of epidemiological dynamics contributes to more precise predictions and more effective public health strategies.</p><p>By integrating stochastic elements, this approach expands our understanding of epidemics and provides advanced mathematical tools for interpreting real epidemiological data. Thus, this study makes a significant contribution to epidemiological modeling, paving the way for better-informed public health decisions and more targeted preventive interventions.</p><p>In conclusion, this paper has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of infectious diseases by employing both deterministic and stochastic analyses. The deterministic dynamics were effectively summarized in Propositions 1 and 2, which highlighted key features of the system's behavior under deterministic conditions. Proposition 1 likely encapsulates the stability conditions or equilibrium states, while Proposition 2 may shed light on the critical points associated with disease spread or control.</p><p>The pivotal transition from deterministic to stochastic analysis marked a significant shift in the study's focus. The stochastic approach, particularly through the Gillespie algorithm and the Fokker-Planck equation, allowed for a more realistic modeling of infectious disease spread. By considering random fluctuations and uncertainties inherent in individual interactions, the stochastic analysis captured the intricacies of epidemics that deterministic models might overlook.</p><p>While the deterministic analysis provides a foundational understanding, the stochastic perspective offers a more comprehensive and applicable framework, considering the inherent variability in real-world epidemiological processes. The introduction of noise, as represented by the stochastic components, enriches the model and better aligns with the unpredictability of infectious disease dynamics.</p><p>However, it is crucial to acknowledge the assumptions made in the model, such as the assumption of well-mixed populations and homogeneity in disease transmission. These assumptions may limit the applicability of the model to specific scenarios. Future research could focus on refining the model to incorporate spatial heterogeneity, non-homogeneous mixing patterns, or other realistic complexities.</p><p>In terms of future research, an exploration of how environmental factors influence disease spread within the stochastic framework could be insightful. Additionally, investigating the impact of interventions, such as vaccination or quarantine measures, within the stochastic SIR model would contribute to practical applications in public health. Addressing these aspects could enhance the model's predictive ability and provide more nuanced guidance for disease control strategies.</p><p>In summary, this study bridges the gap between deterministic and stochastic approaches in epidemiological modeling, offering a nuanced understanding of infectious disease dynamics. Acknowledging the model's strengths and limitations, future research avenues should focus on refining the model's realism and exploring its applications to diverse epidemiological scenarios.</p>
