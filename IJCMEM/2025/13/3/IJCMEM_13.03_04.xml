      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Water channels in Iraq constitute the lifeline of its agrarian economy and urban water supply, sustaining over 60% of the nation’s agricultural output and 85% of its industrial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], however the operational efficiency of these channels is increasingly undermined by sediment deposition, a persistent challenge that reduces hydraulic capacity by up to 40% annually and escalates maintenance costs by an estimated $200 million per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] and this degradation not only threatens food security in a region already strained by climate variability but also exacerbates water scarcity, with projections indicating a 30% reduction in Tigris-Euphrates flow rates by 2030 due to upstream damming and aridification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Existing sediment transport models, like the widely applied Shields criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and the Rouse-Vanoni suspended sediment model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], offer foundational insights but inadequately capture the complex interplay of variables governing Iraqi channels, for instance, these frameworks neglect localized factors like the unique granulometric composition of Tigris-Euphrates sediments—characterized by a bimodal distribution of fine silt (<italic>d50</italic> = 0.02mm) and coarse sand (<italic>d50</italic> = 0.5mm)—and the pronounced seasonal flow variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies highlight that Iraq’s sediment dynamics are further complicated by anthropogenic interventions, includingunregulatedsandminingandleveeconstruction,whichdisruptnaturalsedimentequilibrium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Compounded by climate-driven flow fluctuations, these factors render conventional models, calibrated to temperate or monsoondriven systems, ill-suited for Iraqi conditions. Gao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] showed that for reductions in stream flow and sediment discharge, the contribution rate of human activity was found to be 82.80 and 95.56%, respectively, and was significantly stronger than the contribution rate of precipitation. This evidence clearly suggests that, in the absence of significant decreases in precipitation, strategies for managing the region need to focus on human activities to control erosion without restricting stream flow. A 2022 analysis by Al-Ansari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], demonstrated that global models overpredict deposition rates by 25–40% in Iraqi channels due to their oversimplification of slope-induced shear stress dynamics and turbulent flow regimes and this discrepancy underscores the urgent need for localized empirical tools that integrate the region’s hydro-environmental idiosyncrasies.</p><p>The problem statement lies in the fact that the models and empirical equations used to estimate sediment load are incomplete in estimating the amount of sediment in Iraqi channels. There are specific parameters for these channels that are not included in these equations. The importance of estimating a model that includes these factors will be the goal of this research.</p><p>This study addresses this critical gap by developing a predictive equation tailored to Iraqi water channels, explicitly incorporating flow velocity<italic> (V)</italic>, sediment concentration <italic>(C)</italic>, and channel slope<italic> (S) </italic>and the primary objective is to formulate an empirical model<italic> D =</italic> <italic>f(V,C,S)</italic> capable of quantifying deposition mass <italic>(D)</italic> under variable hydraulic and geomorphic conditions, secondary objectives include (1) disentangling the synergistic effects of <italic>V, C </italic>and <italic>S</italic> through controlled laboratory experiments, (2) validating the model against field data from the Al-Diwaniyah irrigation network—a system representative of Iraq’s sediment-laden channels—and (3) deriving actionable guidelines for channel slope optimization and sediment bypass design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>The hypothesized relationships are grounded in fluid mechanics and sediment transport theory. First, deposition rate is postulated to inversely correlate with V (as per Stokes’ law settling velocity <italic>wδ </italic>= (<italic>ρδ</italic> <italic>− ρ)g d2/(18µ)</italic> and Shields’ critical shear stress <italic>τ_c</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. This relationship has been experimentally validated in Iraqi contexts by Pachaly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], second, sediment concentration (C) is anticipated to exhibit a nonlinear relationship with D, divergingfromthelinearityassumedintheEinstein-Brownmodelduetoturbulence-drivenresuspensionmechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] and third, channel slope (S) is hypothesized to modulate deposition via its influence on bed shear stress<italic> (τ_b = ρgRS)</italic>, with steeper slopes (&gt; 5<sup>◦</sup> ) enhancing transport capacity and mitigating deposition—a phenomenon observed in preliminary field surveys but absent in existing regional models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>By synthesizing these insights, this research advances sustainable water management in arid regions, offering a replicable framework for adapting global sediment transport principles to localized hydrological systems and the derived equation not only addresses Iraq’s infrastructure challenges but also contributes to the broader discourse on climate-resilient hydraulic engineering, particularly in basins experiencing anthropogenic and climatic stressors.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Sediment transport dynamics in open channels have been extensively studied through foundational theories like the Shields equation, which quantifies the critical shear stress required for incipient particle motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] and this framework, later refined by Buffington and Montgomery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], remains pivotal in predicting bedload initiation but often underestimates the role of turbulence in mixed-size sediments common in arid regions. Complementing this, the Rouse number—derived from the balance of turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling—provides a dimensionless metric for suspended sediment distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], This analytical distribution compares the shear velocity (<italic>u∗</italic>) to the fall velocity (<italic>w</italic>) in a dimensionless parameter called the Rouse Number:</p>

      <p>where, k is the dimensionless von Karmen coefficient (∼0.4) and <italic>u∗</italic> is the square root of the ratio between shear stress and fluid density. The smaller the rouse number is, the more uniform the vertical concentration profile is (i.e. concentrations near the surface are closer to concentrations near the bed). The larger the Rouse Number is the more transport is concentrated near the bed. Rule of thumb approaches sometimes suggest that Rouse Numbers &gt; 2.5 mean that the grain class is primarily bedload, Rouse Numbers &lt; 0.8 indicate wash load, and the zone between those include some combination of bed and suspended load. However its application assumes homogeneous turbulence (i.e. is a type of idealized turbulent flow where the statistical properties of the flow (like velocity fluctuations) are the same at all locations), a condition rarely met in natural channels with irregular geometries because these environments inherently create variations in flow characteristics due to changes in depth, width, bed roughness, and obstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Turbulent flow modeling, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, has advanced significantly through computational fluid dynamics (CFD), enabling high-resolution simulations of sediment-laden flows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Recent studies by Dey and Dey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>] integrate these equations with stochastic methods to resolve near-bed turbulence, yet their computational demands limit practicality for field-scale Iraqi channels.</p><p>Globally, Julien [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>] systematized sediment transport mechanics, emphasizing the interplay between flow hydraulics and particle size distribution, while Yalin and Karahan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>] pioneered bedload transport models that distinguish between cohesionless and cohesive sediments and these works, however, prioritize temperate river systems, overlooking the unique granulometry of arid-region sediments, like the Tigris-Euphrates’ bimodal siltsand mixtures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The bimodal distribution, meaning their particle sizes tend to cluster into two distinct groups, typically fine sand and silt, rather than a single, dominant size. This distribution is influenced by the rivers’ flow dynamics, sediment sources, and depositional environment. This distribution of Tigris and Euphrates river sediments is a result of complex interactions between fluvial processes, sediment sources, and aeolian input, leading to a mixture of sand and silt-sized particles with varying mineralogical and geochemical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Sediment deposition with a bimodal size distribution provides diverse habitats for riparian vegetation and benthic invertebrates. After the proposed water transfer, less great events will occur and sediment deposits in the riparian areas will change from having a typical bimodal distribution to having a normal distribution with one peak composed mainly of fine sand. It is found the distribution has one peak around 0.1mm and another around 100mm. The two peaks represent the suspended sediment load in normal years and gravel bed load transportation in great flood events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Regional studies, like Rashad and Kassaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], highlight Iraq’s distinct challenges, including seasonal flow variability exacerbated by upstream damming and anthropogenic sediment disruption, Shaheed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>] reports that conventional models overpredict deposition rates by 25-40% in Iraqi channels due to oversimplified slope-shear stress relationships-a finding corroborated by Al-Hasani [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], who attribute discrepancies to unaccounted turbulence anisotropy in shallow, sloping channels.</p><p>Recent advances in arid-region hydrology, like Scamardo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], demonstrate that channel geometry (e.g., width-depth ratio) significantly modulates sediment transport capacity in ephemeral streams, a factor poorly integrated into global frameworks, similarly, Ghaib et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] identify that levee construction along the Euphrates alters lateral sediment distribution, creating localized deposition hotspots, despite these insights, a persistent gap remains in reconciling channel geometry with sediment properties—like the angularity and density of Mesopotamian sediments—to refine predictive models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], for instance, while the Shields equation effectively predicts incipient motion in uniform sands, its accuracy diminishes for Iraq’s polymodal sediments, as shown experimentally by Al-Ansari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], furthermore, CFD models like those of Pinelli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], though successful in simulating meandering channels, lack validation in the steep, irregular slopes characteristic of Iraqi irrigation networks.</p><p>Emergingmethodologies, likemachinelearning-drivensedimentfluxprediction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], offerpromisingalternatives but require extensive datasets scarce in Iraq’s under-instrumented basins and this underscores the need for regionally calibrated equations that bridge theoretical rigor and empirical pragmatism, a challenge yet to be comprehensively addressed in contemporary literature. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> shows the comparison between studies.</p>

              <p>A recirculating flume (5m length × 0.3m width) was selected to replicate the hydraulic geometry of narrow Iraqi irrigation channels, as recommended by Zettam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] for modeling sediment transport in arid regions and the adjustable slope mechanism (0<sup>◦</sup>-10<sup>◦</sup> ) mimicked topographic variations observed in Iraqi systems, aligning with field surveys by Al-Ansari [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>] and the flume’s recirculation system minimized water waste, critical for arid zone experimentation. It is similar to the channel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

              <p>The experiments were conducted in the Hydraulics and Water Resources Laboratory of the University of Baghdad, Iraq, using a specially designed Recirculating Flume to simulate the hydraulic conditions of Iraqi canals and the canal has the following dimensions:</p><p>Length: 5m (to ensure flow stability).</p><p>Width: 0.3m (to simulate the narrow canals commonly used in Iraqi irrigation networks). Adjustable slope: 0° to 10° (to monitor the effect of slope on sediment transport).</p><p>Channel specifications:</p><p>Walls: Reinforced glass to enable visual observation of hydraulic processes.</p><p>Bottom: Tilt metal plate, covered with a layer of Iraqi river sand (<italic>d<sub>50 </sub></italic>= 0.2 mm) to match the granular properties of Tigris and Euphrates sediments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] and the notation <italic>d<sub>50 </sub></italic>= 0.2 mm refers to the median grain size of the sediment used in the experiment. Here, <italic>d<sub>50</sub></italic> represents the diameter at which 50% of the sediment particles by weight are smaller and 50% are larger and in this case, the median grain size is 0.2mm, indicating that half of the sediment particles have a diameter less than 0.2 mm, and the other half have a diameter greater than 0.2 mm and this parameter is critical in sediment transport studies as it directly influences the settling velocity, erosion, and deposition behavior of the particles in water.</p>
              <p>Flow system: Variable speed pump (range: 0.2-2.0 m) with periodic calibration using an acoustic Doppler (ADV) meter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>].</p>

Mechanistically, the inverse relationship between flow velocity (V ) and deposition mass (D) aligns with shear stress theory, where higher velocities elevate bed shear stress (<italic>τb = ρgRS</italic>), exceeding the critical Shields stress (τ c) and inhibiting particle settling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], for instance, at V = 1.5 m/s, shear stress values (calculated as<italic> τ b</italic> ≈ 12 N/ m2) surpass the threshold for incipient motion of the 0.2 mm sand (<italic>τc </italic>≈ 0.03 N/ m2), explaining the 63% reduction in deposition compared to V = 0.5 m/s, similarly, the negative exponent for slope (S) reflects enhanced sediment transport capacity at steeper angles due to increased gravitational forces, consistent with the Rouse-Vanoni model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] and the positive correlation with sediment concentration (C) <inline-formula>

Adjusting channel slopes to 5° -7°<italic><span style="font-family: Meiryo UI, sans-serif"> </italic>optimizes shear stress balance, reducing deposition by 35-40% compared to flat channels (S = 0°), for example, retrofitting the Al-Diwaniyah network to this slope range could mitigate annual maintenance costs, currently estimated at $200 million. Additionally, maintenance schedules should prioritize channels with sediment concentrations exceeding 0.5%, where deposition rates surge by 28-33%.
