Zirconia's mechanical properties can be improved more effectively by mineral/chemical mixtures or fibers without the issues related to carbon nanotube dispersion. Provide evidence of the advantages of moderately utilizing carbon nanotubes. Without the issues related to carbon nanotube dispersion or the health hazards of handling Nanomaterials, zirconia's mechanical properties can be improved more effectively by mineral/chemical mixtures or fibers. The maximum and ideal load for the load was found to be 163.5 MPa, which was approved in all tests after the six models were finished with their designs in the ANSYS program. This was based on the von mises stress value and the maximum shear stress value less than the yield strength of the basic material used. After making numerous attempts, this load was selected by increasing the load by a specific percentage until it reached the ideal load, at which point the original model was able to support the load without experiencing any problems. The results of the ANSYS program were compared and examined, and they showed that the models' resistance to deformations, displacements, stresses, and various strains greatly increased when carbon nanotubes were added. By adding more carbon nanotubes, those models will be more resilient to the strains and deformations caused by compressive loads. The deformation rate decreased by 60%, which was a very noticeable decrease, especially in the sixth model where the carbon percentage was 5%.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Owing to their exceptional potential and distinct characteristics, ceramic matrix composites offer a new generation of technically advanced applications with exceptional efficiency. Thanks to their strength, light weight, and exceptional resistance to wear, ceramic matrix composites are a great class of materials for use in great tribological applications, aerospace engineering (think hot structures), and automotive applications (think oxygen sensors and brake systems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>].</p><p style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, ceramic materials have a strong reputation for being chemically inert, resistant to corrosion, strong, and thermally stable, which makes them ideal for applications that involve exposure to high temperatures or harsh environmental conditions. Low density ceramic materials with high wear and break resistance are needed in related industries like metallurgy and chemical to use them in cutting-edge applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Well-known biomaterials are ceramics based on the simultaneous presence of diopside (CaMg (SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and wollastonite (CaSiO<sub>3</sub>). The majority of the experiences are related to glass-ceramics from the regulated crystallization of glasses with B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O, CaF2, and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> additives that belong to the CaO-MgO-SiO2 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. However, recent studies have shown the high bioactivity and biocompatibility of ceramics based only on the two silicate phases (in particular, based on eutectic point of the pseudo binary CaSiO<sub>2</sub>-CaMg (SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. The additives may cause the formation of additional phases, such as fluorapatite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. One of the most extensively studied and technologically resilient ceramic materials utilized in numerous applications are ZrO<sub>2</sub>-based nanocomposites. Highly ionic conductivity, low density, chemical inertness, good wear resistance, high mechanical strength, and stability at elevated temperatures are just a few of the significant properties of ZrO<sub>2</sub> that have made it widely applicable in a variety of difficult structural, tribological, and multifunctional applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Common uses are made to withstand challenging conditions and to meet the growing global demand for clean energy. This can be achieved directly through the use of electrochemical power generation, as in the case of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) devices, or indirectly through the use of engines' thermal barrier layer, which guarantees that customers will be able to purchase inexpensive electricity because of the motor's high efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Further significant uses are in the domain of dental implants and load-bearing prostheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], where mechanical characteristics are crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. The first significant advancement in the synthesis and characterization of various structures containing zirconia nanotubes (ZNTs) was reported in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Single-walled Zirconia nanotubes (SWZNT) have been synthesized and characterized using a variety of techniques, including hydrothermal treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], the sol-gel method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], anodization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], bottom-up synthesis by impregnation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], template-assisted depositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], and others. Numerous experimental studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. Determined a number of ZNT's physical, thermal, optical, electrical, and other properties. The scientific communities have been very interested in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) since their discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], as evidenced by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. These days, it is possible to produce large amounts of carbon nanotubes through the pyrolysis of hydrocarbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] or arc discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. Efficient growth of carbon nanotubes in terms of length, diameter, and straightness is crucial for prospective uses as well as in-depth property characterization. The direct pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gas to create insulated carbon nanotubes could be one new technological advancement. Using atomic force microscopy or transmission electron microscopy, numerous studies on physical properties, including flexural stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>] and Young's modulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], have been conducted to date. Single-walled zirconia nanotube (SWZNT) properties have already been the subject of numerous simulations; however, these studies were limited to their physical and chemical aspects, including surface adsorption and diffusion, phonon dispersion, and atomic structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. The ANSAS program will be used to run finite element method simulations on the mechanical properties (compressive loads, bending loads) of SWZNTS. For this study, ratios (Zirconia (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) with carbon nanotubes in the concentrations of 0.00%, 0.01%, 0.02%, 0.03%, 0.04%, and 0.05%) will be used to create SWZNT structural models, which will then be subjected to various mechanical simulation forces. Lastly, an analysis and discussion of the deformations, stresses, and strains seen in SWZNT will be conducted.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>The following was concluded from this theoretical study of composite materials composed of materials of different proportions by creating six models made of different materials, testing each model's compressive resistance, and comparing the results to one another in order to obtain materials with high compressive resistance:</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. The results obtained show a significant decrease in deformation and deflection in the models, when the percentage of carbon nanotubes is increased at very high rates, which may reach 61.9% in the sixth model.</p><p style="text-align: justify">The primary cause of deformation sensing in carbon nanotube-polymer composites is the conductive carbon nanotube network's compressive strength inside the polymer matrices. Consequently, its deformation decreases due to the change in the mechanical deformation of the carbon nanotube network upon loading when its proportion in the material increases to a certain amount.</p><p style="text-align: justify">2. It is observed that applying a load of 163.5 MPa is the maximum optimal load for the models to bear this load without any failure occurring in them when using von Mises theory to compare the results obtained for the six models with the yield compressive strength of these materials.</p><p style="text-align: justify">3. It is also observed that the applied load is suitable for these models to function without failure when comparing the results with the theory of maximum shear stress.</p>

      <title>6. Future studies</title>
      <p style="text-align: justify">The researchers propose to create a number of mathematical models for different engineering materials, including aluminum alloys, composite materials, and magnesium alloys used in the medical field. They advise looking into how different loads in daily life affect engineering materials. withstand loads from impacts, twists, tensile and compression, torsion and fatigue, heat, and other sources. Using state-of-the-art engineering software, like the ANSYS program, carefully examine them to determine the deformations, stresses, and strains they experience during loading.</p>
