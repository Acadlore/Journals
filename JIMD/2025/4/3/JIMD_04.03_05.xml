      <abstract><p>The rapid proliferation of mobile banking has transformed the delivery of financial services, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of service quality and its impact on customer satisfaction. In this study, bibliometric and content analyses were employed to examine the evolution of research on mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction, with emphasis placed on research trends, influential contributors, thematic structures, and emerging gaps. Data retrieved from the Scopus database spanning 2003–2025 were analyzed using VOSviewer and Biblioshiny software to conduct co-word analysis, citation analysis, co-authorship mapping, and bibliographic coupling. Findings indicate a marked acceleration of research activity after 2015, with significant contributions originating from India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, while University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia emerged as one of the most active institutions. The International Journal of Bank Marketing was identified as the leading publication outlet, and scholars such as Lee and Chung were recognized as influential authors. Network analysis revealed that customer satisfaction, trust, security, service quality, and usability constitute the dominant themes in this research domain. Co-authorship analysis demonstrated robust collaborations among Saudi Arabia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, whereas bibliographic coupling confirmed that trust and service quality are central drivers of mobile banking adoption. The originality of this study lies in the provision of a structured synthesis of the intellectual landscape of mobile banking research and in the articulation of critical knowledge gaps. Limitations include reliance on Scopus-indexed studies and the exclusion of non-English publications, which may restrict global comprehensiveness. Future research should prioritize the integration of artificial intelligence in mobile banking, the role of mobile financial services in advancing financial inclusion, and the implications of evolving regulatory frameworks for customer trust and satisfaction. By consolidating existing evidence and highlighting strategic research directions, this study offers a foundation for advancing theoretical, methodological, and practical understanding of mobile banking services.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Mobile banking services signify a revolutionary advancement in the banking sector by allowing users to perform financial transactions using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. This modern banking approach has significantly improved retail banking, driven by technological innovations and the growing need for quick, real-time access to financial services. In contrast to conventional Internet banking, mobile banking is centered on apps specifically developed and personalized by banks or financial institutions, providing a smooth and user-centric experience adapted to individual requirements.</p><p>The emergence of mobile banking has transformed how financial organizations engage with their customers. It has enabled a transition to self-service technologies that let customers autonomously undertake operations, like checking account balances and performing international money transfers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. This trend corresponds with the increasing focus on digital transformation in the banking sector, which addresses modern requirements for speed, accessibility, and efficiency in financial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. Mobile banking provides banks several strategic benefits, such as cost efficiency, market growth, and improved customer trust. Using mobile platforms, banks may access underserved demographics, enter new markets, and provide 24/7 services without the limitations of traditional branches. Moreover, mobile banking enhances operational efficiency, allowing institutions to economize resources while providing superior services. Customers enjoy exceptional convenience since mobile banking lets them oversee their funds anytime and anywhere. Customized offerings, reduced transaction expenses, and time-efficient functionalities make mobile banking an appealing choice for today's customers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, implementing mobile banking presents problems, such as data security, privacy, and the digital divide in certain areas.</p><p>Several factors influence customer satisfaction in mobile banking, including usability, service quality, and security. According to Bouhlel and Mzoughi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], mobile banking platforms' perceived ease of use is crucial in consumers’ willingness to adopt these services. When users find mobile banking interfaces intuitive and easy to navigate, they are more likely to have positive experiences, leading to higher satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Service quality, including responsiveness, reliability, and efficiency, also significantly impacts user perceptions, with studies showing that customers value prompt and accurate services in digital banking environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, security concerns, such as data protection and fraud prevention, influence trust in mobile banking, as customers are more likely to continue using services they perceive as secure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. Thus, banks must prioritize user-friendly designs, high service quality, and strong security measures to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty in mobile banking.</p><p>In recent years, extensive empirical research has been undertaken on mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction. Notable contributions include the work of Jun and Palacios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], who examined the key dimensions of mobile banking service quality; Mostafa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], who explored mobile banking service quality as a new avenue for customer value co-creation; and Hussain et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], who employed a text-mining approach to investigate service quality dimensions in Pakistan. Collectively, these studies have contributed to a growing body of literature, demonstrating that mobile banking service quality plays a critical role in enhancing customer satisfaction.</p><p>Previous bibliometric analyses, such as Alsmadi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], employed a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software to analyze 1206 articles related to mobile banking from the Scopus database. This method allowed for a quantitative assessment of the similarities between articles and the identification of key terms and trends in mobile banking research from 2000 to 2020. Another study by a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis on mobile payment, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive perspective on mobile payment research. The present study examines both peer-reviewed and open-access publications. The articles are from the ScienceDirect, EBSCO, and ProQuest databases from 2007 to 2021. This research selected 250 publications for a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, from which 62 relevant papers published in 48 peer-reviewed and open-access journals were included in the final analysis. This study will provide future researchers with valuable insights into available literature and aid in qualitative literature evaluation.</p><p>The current study could not find a bibliometric analysis of mobile banking services quality and customer satisfaction, nor did it take on a complete bibliometric examination of mobile banking services quality and customer satisfaction studies. To fill this gap, this bibliometric approach is essential for providing an advanced perspective, understanding the progression of literature from conceptual confusion to theoretical investigation, and defining the primary constructs and relationships between them. Moreover, the progression of literature involves the collaboration among researchers that forms the research community for creating and distributing knowledge. Consequently, it is essential to understand the evolution of cooperation between scholars, institutions, and countries from varied backgrounds. The application is very beneficial to researchers and theorists in the scientific field. Accordingly, this study is guided by the core research question: What are the key research trends, contributors, and thematic directions in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction, and how can these insights inform future research and practice? We further explore the following specific research questions to operationalize this broad question.</p><p>RQ: What are the publication trends in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>RQ: Who are the top contributing authors, institutions, and countries in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>RQ: Which are the top-cited articles in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>RQ: What are the major themes and topics in the intellectual structure of mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>RQ: Which are the top collaborative countries regarding mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>RQ: Where else can future Research contribute to mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction?</p><p>This study's primary purpose is to delineate the intellectual progression and knowledge framework predicated on publication quantity and examine the research patterns of sources, documents, authors, institutions, and countries. Moreover, its goal is to explore the major topics in the intellectual structure of mobile banking service quality, impactful research papers, collaboration among nations, and contribute to future research in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction.</p><p>This study will considerably contribute in numerous ways that coincide with the anticipated conclusions of a bibliometric evaluation. This study will yield essential insights into the latest advancements in mobile banking services and will be a preeminent publication in the domain. This research will examine insights derived from performance metrics (such as publication trends, leading institutions, authors, articles, countries, and highly cited articles), intellectual structure (including key concepts and topics, citation patterns, co-authorship, and bibliographic coupling), and content analysis about mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction. This work will improve future research by facilitating the more effective identification and incorporation of new contributions with old ones. This study will stimulate subsequent research by utilizing the insights derived from the current review to inform its proposed agenda. This study will identify deficiencies in current research that subsequent inquiries may rectify to affirm the significance and pertinence of mobile banking services. In addition, this study gives valuable advice to customers, banks, and governments.</p>

            <title>2.1. Data collection method</title>
          
          <p>The Scopus database, a scientific database known for providing one of the most extensive collections of peer-reviewed literature, was employed in this bibliometric analysis study. Furthermore, the Scopus database is renowned for its broad coverage, indexing numerous peer-reviewed articles from various academic fields. It is a valuable tool for bibliometric study since it also offers robust citation metrics. Its stringent editing standards also guarantee that only respectable publications are featured, which lessens the possibility of using inferior sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Scopus was chosen above other databases due to its vast coverage of peer-reviewed publications across numerous disciplines, ensuring a more comprehensive dataset. It offers comprehensive citation analysis tools, extensive author profiles, and structured metadata, which enable research tracking and bibliometric studies; in contrast to Google Scholar, which includes non-peer-reviewed sources, Scopus gives more curated and reliable data. While the Web of Science is prestigious, its journal selection is relatively limited, particularly in non-English publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. </p><p>Sample Selection: We clarified that the dataset was obtained from the Scopus database on January 20, 2025, using the search terms “Mobile Banking Services,” “Mobile banking services,” and “Customer Satisfaction” in the title field. This search initially yielded 165 documents published between 2003 and 2025. After removing duplicates, editorials, notes, and reports, a final sample of 97 peer-reviewed research articles was retained for analysis.</p>

            <title>2.2. Data analysis method</title>
          
          <p>This research used two principal bibliometric analysis methods: descriptive and network analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], and content analysis of the top five most cited articles in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction.</p><p>This research analyzes performance using descriptive analysis of publishing trends, leading contributing countries, authors, journals, and affiliations. This study investigates the principal themes and topics within the intellectual framework by employing science mapping techniques, including co-word analysis, citation analysis, co-authorship analysis, bibliographic coupling analysis, and content analysis of the five most cited articles in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction. We utilize the VOSviewer and biblioshiny software for data analysis and visualization. VOSviewer is a robust visualization tool that employs a distance-based mapping technique to display items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. It presents results as networks and clusters in various colours, reflecting linkages, link strength, and total link strength among articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Biblioshiny is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for Bibliometrix, an R package used for bibliometric analysis. Bibliometric analysis quantitatively analyses academic literature, helping researchers assess publication trends, citation networks, author collaborations, and keyword patterns. Biblioshiny allows users to perform bibliometric analysis without requiring coding skills, making it accessible to researchers from various disciplines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> presents the research design of the current study.</p>

          <p>Since 2015, a noticeable rise in publications has been seen. This is due to the increasing use of mobile technology and its enhanced incorporation into financial services. The number of articles steadily increased from 2015 to 2019, resulting in a significant jump in 2019, totaling 12 publications. This increase likely reflects a broader recognition of the substantial impact of mobile banking on financial services and its capacity to improve customer satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. Following 2019, the publication rate continues, with substantial increases in 2022 and 2024, with 15 and 16 publications, respectively. This increase may be attributed to many sources, such as the rapid progress in mobile technology, including artificial intelligence, safe verification techniques, and accessible interactions, which have made mobile banking more widespread and accessible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Secondly, the COVID-19 epidemic probably increased the dependence on digital banking systems, requiring a more thorough examination of customer service and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. </p><p>The continuing rise in publications shows the growing academic and business interest in understanding the dynamics of mobile banking services and consumer satisfaction. Studies are likely addressing the emerging obstacles, including cybersecurity issues, limitations in digital literacy, competitiveness among financial institutions, and the possibilities and challenges these services pose. The increasing research output highlights the essential role of mobile banking in influencing current economic systems and its importance as a key area of study for enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.</p>

Empirical studies, via the analysis of real-world data, facilitate identifying trends, measuring performance, and evaluating customer behavior, hence informing decision-making and policy formulation in the banking sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>]. These studies assess the influence of innovations, laws, and external influences, ensuring the industry adapts efficiently to changing market circumstances.</p><p>Fifth, Mobile banking and core services are interrelated since Mobile banking platforms provide fundamental banking services such as account management, cash transfers, and bill payments directly to customers using mobile devices. The basic services of Mobile banking provide accessibility and convenience for customers, especially in areas with limited physical banking infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>]. Mobile banking utilizes digital technology to improve service delivery, providing speed, security, and 24/7 availability, which are essential for customer satisfaction and retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>]. </p><p>Sixth, Online banking and ATMs jointly provide users flexible access to financial services. Online banking enables customers to conduct transactions, manage accounts, and pay bills remotely over the Internet, whilst ATMs offer physical access for cash withdrawals and deposits, therefore balancing digital and physical banking requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>]. Together, they improve the banking experience by providing ease and accessibility and addressing diverse consumer preferences and requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. </p><p> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows the progression of significant research issues in mobile banking service quality and consumer satisfaction over time. The size of the circles denotes the frequency of each word in the literature, with bigger circles signifying more study interest in a particular year. Customer satisfaction and mobile banking have emerged as prominent topics in recent years, as seen by increased word frequencies from 2018 forward. This underscores the increasing significance of comprehending the impact of mobile banking service quality on user experience, trust, and loyalty. A recent study on customer satisfaction indicates a shift in emphasis towards service quality, security, and user-friendly interfaces in digital financial services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_42">42</xref>]. Mobile banking became a prominent topic, particularly post-2018, with a heightened scholarly focus on its uptake, security issues, and advantages for financial inclusion. This corresponds with the worldwide development of digital banking services and the growing dependence on mobile apps for financial transactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. Cellular telephone networks support the idea that the expansion of mobile banking is closely linked to progress in mobile communication technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_43">43</xref>].</p><p>The development underscores the significance of sales in mobile banking research, reaching its peak in 2018. This indicates that enterprises and financial organizations have been actively investigating revenue generation, customer interaction, and marketing techniques in the mobile banking domain. Moreover, banking and financial services have seen a consistent rise in academic interest, reflecting continuous discourse around digital banking laws, cybersecurity, and policy formulation. Emerging themes, such as humans and articles, indicate the need for multidisciplinary approaches in mobile banking research, potentially integrating elements of behavioral science, digital literacy, and academic discussions on financial technology.

              <p>Citations are used to assess the impact and significance of scholarly work in academia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_46">46</xref>]. A research publication with a high citation index typically signifies its significant impact within a field. Moreover, a publication's citation trends can show the influence the Research exerts on scholars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_47">47</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref> presents the top five articles based on the link strength of citation analysis and citation index. The study Understanding factors affecting trust and satisfaction with mobile banking in Korea: A modified DeLone and McLean’s model perspective by Lee and Chung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>] found that trust is the most significant variable impacting customer satisfaction in mobile banking. This highlights the importance of building trust in online and offline banking environments. Moreover, system and information quality were identified as having a greater effect on trust than user satisfaction. This suggests that ensuring high-quality systems and accurate information is crucial for fostering trust among users.</p><p>Another impactful article by Thakur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_49">49</xref>] utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the relationships among constructs. The study confirmed that customer satisfaction significantly influences loyalty to mobile banking services. Higher satisfaction leads to increased loyalty among customers. Usability and customer service were identified as critical factors affecting customer satisfaction. A user-friendly interface and effective customer service positively impact satisfaction levels. Kumar et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_50">50</xref>] utilized fixed- and random-effect models to assess the relationship between various factors and mobile banking satisfaction. The random-effect model was chosen due to the high heterogeneity indicated by Q-statistics and I-squared values exceeding 75% across studies. The findings revealed that quality factors, including service quality, system quality, and information quality, positively influence satisfaction with m-banking, supporting hypotheses H1 to H3.</p>

              <p>Bibliographic coupling occurs when two articles have the same reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_56">56</xref>]. Assessing bibliographic coupling aims to identify the current state of active Research within a field and provides a dynamic methodology for examining the conceptual framework of an academic field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_57">57</xref>].</p><p> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> presents the five most-cited publications based on total citations obtained from bibliographic coupling analysis, indicating their status as foundational references in mobile banking service research and customer satisfaction studies. Among these, Lee and Chung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>] received the highest citation count. Their study surveyed 276 mobile banking users, providing empirical evidence to support key findings. The analysis demonstrated that trust, along with three dimensions of service quality—system quality, information quality, and interface design quality—are significant determinants of customer satisfaction. </p><p>Baabdullah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>] reported that both the usability of mobile banking applications and perceived customer service significantly influence customer satisfaction. Specifically, usability was found to increase satisfaction(<inline-formula>

          <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref> presents the five most-cited publications and research articles in mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction. Lee and Chung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_48">48</xref>] investigated the influence of multiple quality factors on user trust and satisfaction in mobile banking. Data were collected from 276 mobile banking users and analyzed using PLS regression with PLS-Graph version 3.0, a confirmatory method suitable for testing theoretical relationships. The results confirmed that trust, along with system quality, information quality, and interface design quality, are significant determinants of customer satisfaction. Baabdullah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_52">52</xref>] examined the factors influencing mobile banking adoption among Saudi users. Constructs from the UTAUT2 and DeLone and McLean success models were employed, focusing on system, service, and information quality, and measured using a seven-point Likert scale. Data were gathered from six major cities across Saudi Arabia to ensure broad representativeness. The analysis revealed that factors derived from the UTAUT2 model significantly influenced actual usage behavior, with performance expectancy identified as the strongest predictor.</p><p>Karjaluoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_58">58</xref>] examined how perceived value influences customer satisfaction and commitment in mobile financial services, providing practical insights for service providers. Data were collected through self-reported surveys, with measures taken to address common method variance and response bias. Advanced statistical techniques were applied to enhance the validity and reliability of the findings. The results highlighted the critical role of perceived value in shaping satisfaction and commitment, with specific drivers and user characteristics moderating these relationships. Stewart and Jürjens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_59">59</xref>] investigated factors affecting FinTech adoption, focusing on strategies that enable financial institutions to achieve economies of scale in competitive markets. A quantitative survey approach was used to assess customer perceptions of data security, trust, and user engagement. The study concluded that, while data security and trust are essential, user interface design and value-added features exert a stronger influence on adoption intentions in the German context. Chung and Kwon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_60">60</xref>] explored the impact of trust on customer satisfaction in mobile banking using a modified IS success model. Structured data collection and analysis were employed to ensure robust and reliable findings. The study demonstrated that trust is a significant determinant of customer satisfaction, providing a validated framework for both future research and practical applications in mobile banking.</p>

      <p>Customers should enhance their awareness of mobile banking security to prevent fraud and unauthorized access. Regularly updating mobile banking apps ensures security and functionality. Using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection. Verifying transaction details before confirming payments helps avoid errors, and reporting suspicious activities immediately to the bank ensures a quick resolution. Banks must improve user experience by making mobile banking interfaces more intuitive and accessible. Strengthening cybersecurity measures protects customer data and prevents cyber threats. Offering financial literacy programs educates customers on mobile banking benefits and risks. Expanding mobile banking services to rural and underserved areas promotes financial inclusion. Ensuring 24/7 customer support helps users with any banking issues or concerns. Governments should implement strict regulations to safeguard the security and privacy of mobile banking transactions. Promoting policies encouraging financial inclusion through digital banking services helps bridge economic gaps. Supporting public awareness campaigns increases trust in mobile banking. Collaborating with banks to establish cybersecurity frameworks protects digital transactions. Incentivizing banks to develop secure and accessible mobile banking platforms ensures broader adoption. Policymakers need to develop policies supporting mobile banking innovation while maintaining security standards. Encouraging competition among banks improves service quality and reduces transaction costs. Establishing guidelines for consumer protection in digital banking ensures that user rights are safeguarded. Supporting research and development in fintech enhances mobile banking solutions. Monitoring the adoption of mobile banking and making data-driven policy adjustments keeps regulations relevant and effective. </p>

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This study thoroughly examines mobile banking services and customer satisfaction using bibliometric and content analysis, yielding significant insights into their development, applications, and prospective future. By analyzing publication trends, leading contributors, and the intellectual themes shaping this discipline using Scopus data from 2003 to 2025, this analysis demonstrates how research on mobile banking has grown substantially since 2015, with marked increases in 2019, 2022, and 2024. This growth underscores the rising importance of digital financial services in the global economy. India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States emerged as the leading contributors, with institutions such as Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia and King Abdulaziz University, and journals like the International Journal of Bank Marketing and the International Journal of Mobile Communications, playing key roles in advancing this field. Influential authors, including Lee, Chung, Thakur, and Karjaluoto, significantly shaped the intellectual foundation of the domain. Network analysis revealed customer satisfaction, mobile banking, trust, and service quality as central themes, while co-authorship patterns highlighted collaborations across countries such as Saudi Arabia, China, the UK, and the USA, with India showing notable research growth. Bibliographic coupling further confirmed that trust, usability, and service quality are critical factors driving mobile banking adoption. In addition to its scholarly contributions, this study offers practical implications for multiple stakeholders. For banks, the results highlight the need to strengthen security mechanisms, improve user-friendly interfaces, and personalize digital services to foster trust and enhance customer loyalty. Policymakers can use these findings to design regulatory frameworks that safeguard customer data, promote financial inclusion, and encourage innovation while maintaining consumer protection standards. Expanding mobile banking access to underserved and rural populations can help reduce economic inequalities and support inclusive growth. Governments and regulators can also collaborate with banks to establish robust cybersecurity frameworks and raise public awareness about safe mobile banking practices. For customers, adopting security measures such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular updates can improve both safety and satisfaction when using mobile platforms. Looking ahead, future research should concentrate on enhancing security mechanisms and trust-building strategies, investigating the role of artificial intelligence and fintech in creating personalized banking experiences, conducting comparative analyses of regulations and consumer protection policies across countries, and exploring how mobile banking can expand financial accessibility in underserved areas.</p>

      <title>6. Limitations and future research directions</title>
      <p>This study has multiple limitations that may affect the generalizability of its results. </p><p>1- Limitations of Scopus Database: We acknowledge that exclusive reliance on Scopus may omit pertinent studies from alternative databases, like Web of Science and Google Scholar. This decision, albeit guaranteeing high-quality peer-reviewed sources, may induce selection bias. Future studies could integrate multiple databases to offer a more thorough analysis of mobile banking service quality and consumer satisfaction. </p><p>2- Exclusion of Non-English Publications: We recognize that restricting the study to English-language journals may exclude significant research from non-English-speaking areas. Subsequent research should incorporate multilingual sources to provide a more comprehensive global perspective on the effects of mobile banking services and consumer satisfaction. </p><p>3- Restricted Range of Source Categories: The omission of books, book chapters, and review articles may have limited the comprehensiveness of our findings. Future research should encompass a wider array of academic and institutional sources to obtain more profound insights into mobile banking service quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
