      <abstract><p>The overhead crane is a typical underactuated system with complicated dynamics and strong couplings. It is widely employed to transport heavy cargoes in many industrial fields. Due to the complexity of working environments, however, cranes often encounter various unfavorable factors, which may degrade the transportation efficiency. To enhance control performance and anti-disturbance ability, this paper proposes an active disturbance rejection control approach based on differential flatness for double pendulum cranes with variable rope lengths. The proposed approach can position the trolley accurately, regulate rope length, and suppress the swing angles of the payload and the hook simultaneously. During the controller design, flat outputs were constructed based on differential flatness technique to deal with system couplings, and the results prove that double pendulum crane system is differentially flat. After that, model uncertainties and external disturbances were estimated by the designed extended state observer. On this basis, a controller was developed based on the feedback control technique. Finally, a series of simulations were carried out to show that the control scheme is effective and robust.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Cranes are typical nonlinear underactuated systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>] with strong state couplings. Due to their numerous benefits, including their large transport capacity and inexpensive prices, cranes are frequently employed in factories and harbors to move heavy freight. According to diverse mechanical architectures, cranes can be categorized into many types, such as overhead cranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], tower cranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], offshore container cranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], and so forth. In reality, skilled employees frequently operate cranes manually. Possible operational errors could result in a significant payload swing and safety issues. External disturbances would also make crane systems more difficult to operate, which might further reduce transportation efficiency. In order to achieve optimal control performance, it is required to build automatic control methods for crane systems.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Overhead cranes are the most popular type of crane utilized in industrial manufacturing. Generally speaking, the overhead crane control has two important objectives, namely, the fast and accurate positioning of the trolley, and the effective elimination of swing. Over the past few decades, numerous academics have presented a variety of control systems that can be broadly grouped into two categories to address the control problem for overhead cranes. The first category is open-loop control approaches, including trajectory planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], input shaping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], and other techniques. As an illustration, Tho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>] proposed a minimum-time trajectory planning method for overhead crane systems that further achieves vibration-free performance. The other is closed-loop control techniques, which include adaptive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], sliding mode control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], energy-based control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>], and partial feedback linearization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. For example, Wu proposed a continuous global sliding mode controller along with a nonlinear disturbance observer to regulate and estimate the disturbance of the overhead crane system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. To achieve satisfactory robustness, Zhang and He [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>] designed a significant storage function characterized by the desired damping based on passivity, and further delivered a nonlinear controller by enforcing the coupled-dissipation inequality. Meanwhile, some intelligent control methods have been applied to overhead crane systems, such as neural network-based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] and fuzzy logic-based methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The methods outlined above are typically used in single pendulum overhead crane systems, which ignore the geometry of the payload and treat it and the hook as a single mass point. In actuality, however, the hook mass cannot be ignored and the payload size may be too large to be considered a mass point. When this occurs, it is impossible to simply treat the payload and the hook as one mass point, and the crane system would function as a double pendulum with the payload swinging around the hook and the hook swinging around the trolley. The control problem of a double pendulum crane is substantially more challenging when compared to a single pendulum crane system because there is now an additional unactuated state variable. For double pendulum cranes, a few control strategies have been put forward. For the double pendulum crane, Ouyang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] created an adaptive tracking controller to address parameter uncertainty. Zhang and Jing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] presented an adaptive neural network tracking control method to address the input dead-zone and tracking error restriction of the crane system. Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] proposed a partial enhanced-coupling nonlinear controller with initial saturation, taking into account the fact that many controllers disregard the size of the actuator's initial value. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] put forward a nonlinear sliding mode control approach to control the distributed mass payload of double pendulum cranes. Similarly, additional control techniques, like the quasi-proportional integral derivative control approach, are also utilized for the double pendulum crane system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>].</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">There are still issues that need to be resolved even if the crane control problem has been researched in great detail. The majority of methods in use today are created for double pendulum crane systems with constant rope lengths, which often neglect the hoisting and lowering of payloads. To make the overall transportation process more effective, the cargo may even need to be raised or lowered while the trolley is moving horizontally in specific circumstances.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">Active disturbance rejection control techniques have been substantially studied recently, with a focus on the benefits of high control accuracy and strong anti-disturbance capacity. The active disturbance rejection control technique is a useful control method that has been employed successfully in many engineering applications, including the control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>], position tracking control of dc torque motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], vibration suppression control of building structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], etc. Meanwhile, some robustness issues of nonlinear systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>] and uncertain systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>] can be resolved using active disturbance rejection control approaches.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">In light of this, the authors provided a differential flatness-based active disturbance rejection control strategy for double pendulum cranes with variable rope lengths. Particularly, it is demonstrated that this system is differentially flat and that effective flat outputs have been produced by carefully examining the dynamic model of a double pendulum crane. The transition process of the flat outputs is then built, and the tracking differentiator and extended state observer are designed to estimate the flat output signals and the total disturbances of the system, respectively. Finally, simulation tests are put into place to confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the suggested controller.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.1pt;">The main contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>1. It is established that the double pendulum crane system with variable rope lengths is differentially flat, and effective flat outputs are also built using differential flatness technique. These features are employed to handle couplings and more easily accomplish the swing suppression objective.</p><p>2. The tracking differentiator that was created for the flat output of double pendulum cranes with variable rope length enables a seamless transition process and further enhances the crane system's durability and transport effectiveness.</p><p>3. The extended state observer and disturbance compensation technique used in the proposed active disturbance rejection controller allow it to accurately predict and account for the numerous unfavorable variables.</p><p>4. The proposed control method requires only a few feedback signals, which reduces control costs and simplifies engineering application.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the dynamic model and the control objectives of the double pendulum crane system; Section 3 details the construction process of differential flatness output and the active disturbance rejection control; Section 4 implements a series of simulations to verify the effectiveness of our method; Section 5 summarizes the entire paper.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">To transport the payload, an active disturbance rejection control approach needs to be designed based on the differential flatness theory for the double pendulum crane system with variable rope lengths. The approach should be able to regulate the trolley position and the rope length to desired values, while effectively suppressing the swing of the hook and the payload simultaneously:</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">The authors adopted MATLAB/Simulink to implement three groups of simulation tests, aiming to thoroughly verify the control performance of the suggested method. The first group is specifically used to compare our method to several current control methods and to validate the control performance of our method for a double pendulum crane with variable rope lengths under normal conditions. In the second group, our method's control performance is further evaluated using a modified payload mass and modified trolley target position. The third group is created to introduce external disturbance and check the robustness.</p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">In all simulations, the trolley mass, the hook mass, and the payload mass were selected as 7 kg, 5 kg, and 5 kg, respectively. The distance between the hook center and the payload center was set as 0.6 m. The initial trolley position and initial rope length were set as 0 m and 0.2 m, respectively. The target trolley position and the desired rope length were set as 2 m and 1 m, respectively. Meanwhile, the gravity acceleration was adopted as 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p><p style="text-indent: 9.9pt;">After carefully tuning, the control parameters of our method can be determined as:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><inline-formula>

      <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>, our method drives the trolley to the target position accurately, regulates the rope length to the desired value, and suppresses the swing of the payload and the hook efficiently. There is almost no residual swing after the transportation. In contrast, the LQR cannot eliminate large swing angles, or the residual swings of the hook and the payload after the trolley stops (as shown in the middle two subplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>The speed of the trolley and the length of the rope can be controlled within a narrow range, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. Therefore, it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> that our method has much superior effects for swing suppression and residual swing elimination than the LQR. Furthermore, it can be seen from the fifth subplot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> that the proposed method's overall force trajectory is smoother and the trolley's initial actuating force is zero, whereas the LQR control method necessitates a higher starting actuating force.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">To further test the performance of our method, the second group involves two cases. In the first case, the payload mass is changed to <italic>m</italic><sub>2</sub>=7 kg. In the second case, the target position of the trolley is modified to <italic>x</italic><sub>d</sub>=3 m. For both cases, the control parameters are kept the same with those the first group. The simulation results of the second group are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>, even if the payload mass is altered, the control target of precise trolley position, rope length regulation, as well as the suppression of the swing of the hook and the swing of the payload, is met, which is comparable to that in the first group. With a different payload mass, there are no placement errors. The maximum swing amplitudes of the hook and the payload only rise to 1 deg and 1.5 deg, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref> shows that, after modifying the trolley target position, proper control performance can still be attained with no positioning error.</p><p style="text-indent: 10pt;">The authors examined our method's resistance to disturbances in the third group. To the hook and payload, the authors manually added the initial swing angle disturbance, the external swing angle disturbance, and the random swing angle disturbances. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref> display the simulation findings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref> shows that even when the hook and the payload experience initial swing angle disturbances, the proposed controller continues to operate properly. The impact of the initial swing can be swiftly removed. In the meantime, it can be seen by comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> that the back-and-forth motion of the trolley and the rope variation can further eliminate the added external swing disturbances for the payload and the hook (as shown in the enlarged parts of the top two subplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>) and that the influence of external disturbances is suppressed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_8">Figure 8</xref>, swing suppression and precise payload positioning may still be satisfactorily managed even when the system is subjected to random disturbance during the hoisting process. These simulations demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the proposed controller.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 10pt;"><italic>Remark 1</italic>: In reality, heavy cargoes are delivered to their destinations via the crane system. In general, the crane mechanism is static and has no swing angle at first. Large initial swing angles are not necessary to start payload transportation. Because the swing angle is typically minimal in practice, several linearizations are performed throughout the controller design. This suggests that, in order to satisfy the small angle assumption, it might need a modest maximum swing angle amplitude, perhaps less than 10 deg. The swing angles for our method are likewise discovered from the provided simulation results to be all less than 10 degrees, which further confirms the validity of the small angle assumption. Despite the fact that the maximum swing angle may occasionally be greater, our technique may still be useful due to its robustness.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p style="text-indent: 10.2pt;">In this paper, an active disturbance rejection control scheme is proposed to address the control issues of a double pendulum crane with variable rope lengths. This scheme achieves accurate regulation for the trolley position and the rope length, as well as the simultaneous suppression of the swings of the hook and the payload. In specifically, this system is first demonstrated to be differentially flat with flat output built effectively after careful analysis for the dynamic model. Then, the proper tracking differentiator is developed to coordinate the transition process of the desired outputs, and the flat output and the system's overall disturbances are evaluated by the extended state observer. An active disturbance rejection controller is put forward after that. The designed controller finally achieves adequate performance and robustness with respect to disturbances, as per various simulation results.</p>
