      <abstract><p>Over the past 15 years, online travel agencies (OTAs), such as Booking.com and Expedia.com, have grown significantly. This growth is correlated with their spending on R&amp;D and marketing initiatives. Digital marketing promotes services and products by using an electronic platform. This study aims to ascertain the role of digital marketing in perceived quality and consumer confidence in hotel performance in the age of digital technology. This quantitative study employs statistical testing, namely the partial least squares (PLS) design, in order to understand the link between the two aforementioned variables. In the meantime, the authors conducted a data search by going through a Google form questionnaire on hotel visitors in Tangerang, specifically between October 2020 and October 2021. The survey questionnaires were distributed to 145 respondents, and Smart PLS 3.0 was used in the analytic procedure. The results of digital marketing, including consumer perceptions of quality and trust, play a key role in hotel success. This conclusion is a succinct summary of the research findings in the hope that it will be useful for future research on a comparable topic by academics and other hotel managers.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Technology advancements in this digital age drive customers to use it to meet daily necessities. This is evident from how many customers use information technology resources to satisfy their information needs, one of which includes using the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>].</p><p>Tourists consider the COVID-19 epidemic in terms of costs, energy use, and safety as it now wreaks havoc on the planet. It is projected that leisure travel will continue to be the main strategy for fostering family harmony and economic recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. </p><p>Indonesians are increasingly interested in traveling, and the nation's tourist industry is growing swiftly. Several tourism-related businesses, such as websites and social media channels that discuss travel experiences and tourist destinations, have also undergone changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Nearly everyone needs tourism as a commodity in the age of the fourth industrial revolution and globalization. By participating in tourism-related activities, one can increase creativity, alleviate workplace monotony, acquire insight into a place's culture, unwind, learn about a country's relevant heritage, and do business [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. </p><p>Consumer lifestyles change as the Internet becomes an easily accessible source of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. People's shopping habits have shifted from traditional to online transactions, as a result of the flow of changing times and their changing lifestyles. Many online sales sites have made it simpler for consumers to access information and transaction without going to a place to sell products or services, owing to the changes in people's purchasing habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The benefits of online purchasing, which save time, effort, and money [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], are to blame for this shift in customer behavior.</p><p>Companies must empower their resources effectively and efficiently in order to have a competitive advantage, given the present business changes, difficulties, and fiercer competition for market share. According to the results of Alamsyah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], Assaker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], and Alves et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>], in order to thrive in the face of competition, any company must be able to create marketing strategies. One such strategy is to have a marketing strategy in the form of a marketing mix with digital marketing. The company's business plan should have an impact on both financial and non-financial profits, help it stay competitive, and enable it to meet its long-term objectives.</p><p>Marketing is now a key career in some contexts. Since the advent of the Internet, digital marketing technology becomes more sophisticated and competitive. It has grown into a focal point of meaningful learning in the marketing context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>]. For hotel marketers and certain business operators, it is crucial to realize promotion and marketing responsibilities. Compared to traditional promotion strategies, the situation that many hotel and tourism businesses receive the majority of potential clients will not change. In these days, digital marketers start to promote their items online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Similar to how search engines, social media marketing, and videos broadcasted through certain channels have grown increasingly important in application-based digital marketing in lodging and hospitality. An emerging trend in finding and making reservations online is computerization, which expands the possibilities for finding out what customers want. Marketing and advertising managers need to employ and combine digital advertising heavily while marketing an inn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>].</p><p>Tourism is a source of foreign exchange for the nation outside the oil and gas business. This industry has great potential and influences economic growth even if it is still in the early stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Indonesia has a lot of stunning and distinctive tourism spots. Each region has an own culture that typifies the region's qualities. The diversity of Indonesia's culture and tourism is admired by many travelers, both domestic and foreign. Hence, hotel rivalry is fierce in many locations. Even hotel management fight to offer their room units at the lowest feasible price. If not, they will not get any visitors. Competition exists not just between hotels of the same class but also between hotels of different classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. The competition gets even worse, due to the tightening market conditions. Everyone, both domestic and foreign, may learn about the possibilities for regional tourism thanks to the Internet. Alamsyah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>] and Assaker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], who studied digital marketing has a positive and significant effect on hotel and other organizational performances. Thus, digital marketing has a positive and significant effect on organizational performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. </p><p>Closely associated persons, such as local governments, travel associations, hoteliers, restaurant entrepreneurs, and others, can provide a website that anybody can access regarding the possibilities of the local travel industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Advanced promotion has a significant impact. This is related to the work of the sales and marketing department, which is responsible for presenting and promoting hotels and their offerings online through the use of transient media. The review conducted by Chi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], Dastane and De [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], Pelsmacker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] found that consumers' purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by the Internet. A huge opportunity for finance managers to market their products is the growing audience for online and virtual entertainment. De Pelsmacker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>] used the term scorching to describe the enormous opportunity for online advertising.</p><p>Customers that are satisfied with a product or service will recommend it to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Computerized marketing is a type of advertising that connects with potential customers by promoting or marketing a product or service through modern media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Digital advertising is a type of advertising frequently used to promote goods or services and reach customers through digital platforms. Digital marketing is crucial in the age of globalization, due to its wide scope and user-friendly target market segment, which can be accessed by the entire population. Digital marketing is correlated with organizational performance, references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>] which is the ability to carry out the tasks assigned to the organization and achieve agreed targets. Digital marketing brings many benefits to the company. One of these benefits is the increase in sales through digital marketing. This research explores the effect of digital marketing on hotel performance, perceived quality to hotel performance, the effect of trust on hotel performance, the effect of digital marketing on perceived quality, and the effect of digital marketing on trust.</p><p>Technologies that provide feedback, ratings, and suggestions have become one of the most well-liked social shopping channels, owing to how simple they are to use and how easily users can share their entire buying and evaluation experiences. Social trading, which enables customers to digitalize their purchasing decisions through two-stop communication and strong relationships with other customers, has replaced traditional e-commerce business models that focused on one-stop shopping and browsing, as the use of social media rises. The potential impact of other people's opinions has considerably increased with the expansion of the Internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p><p>In a time of intense competition, hotel managers unquestionably have a duty to boost hotel performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. For customers to find the hotel more easily, managers must understand the importance of marketing and tactics like digital marketing that enable hotels to operate better. In addition, customers will regard the hotel as a reputable establishment that they can depend on if they need a place to stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Like hotel managers, having the proper knowledge and plan for running a hotel, and with a tried-and-true plan, the hotel can easily provide the necessary service to entice guests to stay. Of course, any induction has its challenges because the competition is so fierce. The use of websites is undoubtedly a strategy for marketing so that hotels can compete healthily among a large number of hotel growth, and challenges can be overcome by developing hotel marketing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. &amp;amp;nbsp;</p><p>The hierarchical execution is affected by perceived quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. The growth of the perceived quality variable would clearly and significantly affect the execution of authoritative decisions. Thus, the following hypothesis can be put forth: The impact of perceived quality on hotel performance is positive and significant. Digital marketing has a significantly positive impact on the operations of hotels and other organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Digital marketing positively and significantly affects organizational performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. Hence, it is assumed that: The impact of digital marketing on hotel performance is positive and significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Trust in digital marketing exerts a major effect on hotel guests' trust. To coordinate customer interest in purchasing, buyer trust in a product is essential. As a result, the following hypothesis can be made: Digital marketing has a large positive impact on trust. Trust influences the effectiveness of authoritative execution or hotel performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_36">36</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_37">37</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_39">39</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_40">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_41">41</xref>]. Then, the following hypothesis can be put forward: Trust has a considerable positive impact on hotel performance. Digital marketing has a significant impact on an organization's ability to enhance customers' perceptions of value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. In a similar industry, notably in the hotel business of Tangerang, advanced marketing as a respectable unique method and expertise would pose a serious risk. Thus, the following hypothesis can be put forth: Digital marketing has a positive and strong effect on perceived quality.</p><p>In contrast to traditional approaches, hotels in modern information technology-driven era clearly have tasks and ways to address marketing issues, so as to benefit hotels. Making it simple for guests to locate their hotel will help them develop into loyal guests, who will no longer be hesitant to visit as regular clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. To empower existing resources and make the hotel easier to find online, digital promotional applications are the best option. In-depth studies are needed to attract visitors via online marketing.</p><p>To assure the functioning of their hotels in the digital era, hotel managers must undertake more research. In the global era, tourists are accustomed to fast Internet access. Gomezelj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] pointed out that the tourists rely on electronic devices to search for hotels. Hotel managers must attach great importance to marketing, especially digital marketing to win the trust of tourists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>]. Therefore, hotel managers should clearly understand the role of marketing strategies. Through digital marketing, it is important to make consumers perceive the hotel as having quality and can be trusted as a place to stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. </p><p>Hotel managers and other interested parties need to comprehend the relationship between hotel performance variables in the digital era and the role provided by digital system marketing as well as perceived trust and quality by potential guests. For this purpose, a hotel marketing study was conducted based on the direct survey data in the field. By analyzing the survey data, analysts could derive how the use of digital marketing improves appearance, including perceptions of quality and terraces of hotels in the eyes of consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>]. It is critical to improve hotel in an era that is full of competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>].</p><p>This study carries out a field survey by distributing questionnaires to hotel visitors in Tangerang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>]. The goal is to clarify the role of digital marketing in perceived quality and consumer confidence, two metrics of hotel performance in the era of digital technology.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>This study aims to prove the promoting role of digital marketing in the performance, perceived quality, and trust of hotels in Tangerang. For this reason, a series of data were collected by distributing questionnaires to 145 respondents hotel visitors in Tangerang between 2020 and 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>]. The collected data were processed and analyzed through statistical tests, using the partial least squares (PLS) model. The PLS, a part of structural equation modeling (SEM), is a convenient way of sampling. Here, the collected data are analyzed on SmartPLS 3.0, with the aid of PLS-SEM. The specific scheme is described below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_32">32</xref>].</p>

      <p>The quantitative data analysis adopts a Likert 5-point scale: strongly disagree = 1, disagree = 2, neutral = 3, agree = 4, and strongly agree = 5. The measuring errors were corrected on SEMPLS, taking account of the interaction effect in the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. The software examines the resampling results by bootstrapping. The PLS SEM estimation aims to form the best score component of the endogenous variable, i.e., the travel choice variable. In addition, SEM PLS predicts the relationship between latent variables and external models through an internal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_33">33</xref>]. </p><p>The SEM is implemented in the following steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]: (1) Develop a theory-based model; (2) Build path diagrams for causal relationships; (3) Convert path diagrams into structural models and measurement models; (4) Select the input matrix and conduct model estimation; (5) Assess the selected structural model, (6) Evaluate the suitability of the model based on fitness; (7) Interpret and modify the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Reliability testing aims to determine the size of a test that has consistent and stable results every time. To make sure that each notion of each latent variable is distinct from other latent variables, discriminant validity is used.

An increase in digital marketing variables in the organization will positively and significantly affect improving organizational performance. In the face of current competition and a slowing economic situation that results in decreased growth of the hotel industry, the ability of hotels to implement marketing strategies is essential to note. Digital Marketing owned by hotels must continue to be considered and developed following existing developments. This is expected to be able to make the hotel survive from economic fluctuations for the sake of the company's sustainability in the future. However, in maintaining the hotel to continue to grow, it cannot only depend on the Digital Marketing owned by the hotel. To maintain good Digital Marketing, it is necessary to have Intellectual Capital that supports the course of marketing itself.</p>
