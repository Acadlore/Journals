      <abstract><p>A comparative investigation is conducted, employing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to study two distinct room space configurations: one featuring a solar chimney and another integrating both a solar chimney and a geothermal system. The primary objective of this investigation is to scrutinize the thermal behavior, energy efficiency, and mass flow rates of these systems. Results underscore the considerable positive implications of the geothermal system integration. This amalgamation precipitates diminished average room temperatures and elevated mass flow rates, signifying superior thermal comfort and energy performance. The room implementing the geothermal system exhibited an average temperature of 302.2 Kelvin and a mass flow rate of 4.134 × 10<sup>−6</sup> kg/s, in contrast to the room without the geothermal system, which demonstrated an average temperature of 309.6 Kelvin and a mass flow rate of 1.878 × 10<sup>−6</sup> kg/s. These findings have practical repercussions for architects, engineers, and policymakers, facilitating well-grounded decisions in the domain of sustainable building design. The observed enhancement in thermal performance and mass flow rates underscore the potential merits of integrating geothermal systems, thereby promoting wider acceptance. Further research is recommended to investigate the influence of varied climatic conditions, building orientations, and room layouts on the efficiency of integrated solar chimney and geothermal designs. Examination of alternative renewable energy sources (RES), innovative building materials, and technologies is also suggested to elevate energy efficiency and sustainability in room space designs. This study contributes substantially to the expanding realm of sustainable building design, providing valuable insights for refining room space performance, curbing energy consumption, and heightening thermal comfort. By highlighting the advantages of renewable energy integration, particularly geothermal systems, the study stimulates the development of more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly building spaces.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Housing represents one of the fundamental human necessities alongside clothing and food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Interestingly, the procurement of residential and commercial properties is responsible for over a third of the global energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions linked to energy use. Two principal strategies have been identified to mitigate this significant environmental impact: the decarbonization of manufacturing processes and the reduction of energy consumption in construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Traditional environmental strategies have focused primarily on enhancing energy efficiency and exploiting RES, often neglecting the importance of material efficiency during the construction phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. This oversight potentially leads to missed opportunities for effective emission reductions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref> provides an illustration of the impact of the greenhouse effect on the environment.</p><p>Consideration must be given to the complex trade-offs between emissions generated before and after the utilization of a building. Interestingly, buildings that boast high efficiency may necessitate more resources during construction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. The production of building materials, which contributed 11% to global energy- and process-associated GHG emissions in 2018, remains an area of significant concern. Key building materials such as cement, brick, steel, and other metals and nonmetallic elements have a substantial contribution to environmental pollution.</p>

      <p>Predictions indicate a rapid surge in the demand for new structures in the coming decades, driven by expanding populations and increasing income levels, particularly in Asia and Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the density of populations in urban areas necessitates modifications to housing, leading to an upswing in construction requirements. Despite advancements in building technology that allow for more environmentally-friendly construction methods, less-efficient techniques persist, particularly in regions experiencing the highest demand for new structures. This discrepancy presents a formidable challenge in meeting global climate goals while reducing GHG emissions linked to building materials.</p><p>A viable approach to lessen the environmental impact of buildings is through the implementation of green building principles. These principles utilize design strategies, materials, and technologies to minimize adverse effects on the environment and human health. The Green Building Council defines a green building as one that employs planning, construction, and operation methods that significantly curtail its environmental impact and enhance occupant well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. These buildings are recognized for adhering to specific criteria presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

      <p>Green buildings distinguish themselves from traditional constructions through their emphasis on several essential aspects: integration and innovative design processes, efficient siting and structure design, material and resource efficiency, energy efficiency, environmental protection, building commissioning, and water and waste management.</p><p>In recent years, considerable momentum has been gained in research focused on the environmental impacts of construction materials and mitigation techniques. Previous investigations have concentrated primarily on residential building materials within specific countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Certain studies have also scrutinized specific material types over time. However, many studies have only contemplated individual factors, making it challenging to provide an accurate estimation of emissions without consistent data on material demand and process emissions intensity. A seminal study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>] delved into the environmental implications of improving building material efficiency in nine major countries. However, it omitted developing regions in Africa and Asia, which are expected to account for a significant portion of the world's housing demand growth in the coming years. Attia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>] proposed an optimization model that dynamically schedules energy consumption from renewable and non-renewable power sources, in tandem with an energy storage system (battery), in smart buildings. The central goal was to curtail CO<sub>2</sub> emissions whilst minimizing customer billing costs. Simulation outcomes demonstrated the efficacy of this approach, whether or not a carbon emissions tax was used to penalize non-green energy usage. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>] explored the Internet of Building Energy System, which collects energy use data through sensors in the Intelligent Gateway and provides timely consumption reports. This method enables adjustments to achieve energy-saving objectives, effectively reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Kaushik [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], investigated multi-agent deep learning for cyber-attack detection in IoT systems, specifically in green energy buildings. The proposed framework combines multi-agent systems and deep learning algorithms to enhance IoT network security. The collective intelligence of multiple agents enables real-time detection and mitigation of cyber threats, safeguarding critical infrastructure and sensitive data in green energy buildings.</p><p>Recent research has explored GHG emissions in European cities over ten periods in the building's life cycle. The study calculated heating and cooling loads using coefficients of heat transfer for external walls, floors, and ceilings, as well as heating and cooling degree day values. Natural gas and electricity were considered as fuel options during the heating season, while emissions from electricity generation were included during the cooling season. The study revealed variations in emissions among different cities, with Tallinn, Estonia, showing the lowest nitrogen oxide emission and Stockholm, Sweden, exhibiting the highest carbon dioxide emission value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Another study proposed an innovative 'Inclined Solar Chimney' (ISC) design, which integrates the collector and chimney along the face of a high-rising mountain to maximize solar insolation throughout the year. This design enhances energy efficiency and harnesses wind energy present at the mountain's summit, providing an economical and reliable option for buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].</p><p>In the exploration of renewable heating strategies, a passive solar system termed as the 'Sunspace' alongside a solar chimney (SS) was proposed for rural houses in Iran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Results indicated that this system increased the heat production during the winter while enabling natural ventilation for cooling in hot seasons. The implementation of such a system yielded significant energy savings, marking it as a practical and cost-effective solution. A novel application of deep learning techniques was explored in the context of medical diagnostics, specifically for the diagnosis of brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. The role of precise diagnostics was emphasized, as it can reduce unnecessary medical procedures and energy consumption in healthcare facilities, thereby indirectly contributing to the sustainability and reduced environmental impact within green energy buildings.</p><p>An innovative combination of a solar chimney (SC) with a photovoltaic (PV) module and phase-change material (PCM) to enhance PV module efficiency and extend the SC's productive period was suggested. This system, known as the SC-PV-PCM system, presented improved performance with specific PCMs, indicating its potential for natural ventilation and power generation in buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. For residential buildings, the SC-PV-PCM system emerged as a superior choice, while for office buildings in subtropical environments, the SC-PV system was recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p>The transformative potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with business analytics was underscored, particularly within the green energy buildings sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The strategic decision-making capabilities enabled by AI's ability to simulate human intelligence and analyze extensive data sets could facilitate optimal energy consumption and enhance overall efficiency in green buildings. AI-powered algorithms were also recognized for their potential in reducing carbon emissions and conserving resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>A unique building structure was proposed on the bank of a river in Jamshedpur, India, utilizing three fundamental passive cooling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. This method coupled wind-driven natural ventilation with PCM for nocturnal ventilation and incorporated a geothermal cooling technique using a trench dug along the riverbank. The results showed that this approach enhanced cooling efficiency in hot climates. In a separate study, criteria to distinguish between conventional and renewable energy in hybrid power plants were presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Here, the impact of geothermal fluid temperature on the operation of hybrid power plants was evaluated, providing insights into the potential and limitations of such systems.</p><p>Various investigations have focused on potential solutions for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in residential and commercial buildings in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. These studies highlighted the capacity of energy-efficient technology and processes to significantly reduce future GHG emissions while concurrently lowering energy costs. Elsewhere, green construction concepts were explored for vertical housing, emphasizing the need for indoor comfort and outdoor control based on respondents from diverse age groups and professions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. The findings from this study are anticipated to contribute to future green building assessment standards for vertical housing in Indonesia. In addition to these explorations, queueing models' application in the hospital sector was reviewed, offering insights into patient flow, resource allocation, and system efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. The use of these models aligns with the broader goal of promoting sustainability in green energy buildings by optimizing operational efficiency and minimizing resource wastage. Moreover, a bilevel new energy planning and simulation operation framework for new distribution networks was proposed, considering green power certificate trading (GPCT) and carbon emissions trading (CET) mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>]. This model aimed to reduce carbon emissions, operation costs, and overall investment costs in energy planning for distribution networks.</p><p>Investigations have also looked at the importance of data scaling methods in machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions in green energy buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. These studies applied standardization, normalization, and min-max scaling techniques to preprocess and transform data, optimizing energy efficiency and supporting sustainable practices. Emphasis was placed on increasing energy efficiency in the manufacturing sector, particularly in the context of "green manufacturing" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. The study discussed key GHG reduction solutions and pathways to transition towards green manufacturing.</p><p>A study by Avramidou and Tjortjis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>] developed regression and classification methods to forecast GHG emissions from the construction industry, identifying critical building factors that lead to excessive emissions. This study focused on projecting metric tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from buildings and their compliance with environmental legislation, particularly concerning energy, fuel, and water consumption. Natural gas utilization and energy intensity were identified as significant factors influencing the decarbonization of the building sector. Singhal and Sagar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] conducted an analysis of a recently built hospital building, focusing on energy-efficient and intelligent techniques to optimize energy use and maximize natural resource utilization. The study examined various aspects of hospital green buildings, including electrical equipment based on the Energy Conservation Building Code and Bureau of Energy Efficiency ratings. Key topics covered in the study include the HVAC system, water treatment facility, building management structure, solar water heating system, solid waste generation and management, and sewage treatment facility.</p><p>The current study seeks to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of room space designs integrating sustainable technologies. More specifically, the evaluation and comparison of the thermal behavior and mass flow rates of two room space designs, one incorporating a solar chimney and the other combining a solar chimney with a geothermal system, are aimed at. The integration of these technologies has shown promise for enhancing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in buildings, but there exists a research gap in evaluating their performance in terms of thermal behavior and mass flow rates.</p><p>The guiding research questions for this study are:</p><p>(1) How does the incorporation of a geothermal system along with a solar chimney affect the thermal behavior of a room space design compared to the use of a solar chimney alone?</p><p>(2) What is the impact of adding a geothermal system on the mass flow rates in a room space design with a solar chimney?</p><p>Based on the existing knowledge, it is hypothesized that the room space design incorporating both a solar chimney and a geothermal system will show superior thermal behavior and higher mass flow rates compared to the design with only a solar chimney. To verify these hypotheses, CFD simulations will be utilized to evaluate the thermal behavior and mass flow rates of each design. It is expected that the findings of this investigation will provide valuable insights into the performance and feasibility of sustainable room space designs, thus facilitating the development of energy-efficient and environmentally conscious building practices.</p>

      <title>2. Methodology</title>
      <p>The analytical methodology employed herein consists of several precise steps for a comprehensive evaluation of the room space design. Initially, an individual room space was accurately rendered using Creo, an advanced 3D modeling software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>]. This stage of the modeling procedure incorporated sophisticated techniques such as sketching and extrusion, with dimensions derived from authoritative literature to safeguard accuracy and consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>].</p><p>Following the completion of the room space design within Creo, a seamless importation of the model into the ANSYS design modeler was conducted, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 3</xref>. This step is crucial, permitting an exhaustive examination and validation of the model's integrity, inclusive of potential surface anomalies such as roughness and waviness, thereby confirming optimal performance and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>].</p><p>Through stringent adherence to these methodological procedures, the production of precise and dependable results was ensured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>]. The meticulous modeling process in Creo, accompanied by rigorous error-checking in ANSYS, laid a solid foundation for subsequent analyses and findings. This combination of advanced 3D modeling software and meticulous error-checking in the design modeler culminated in a holistic evaluation of the room space design's performance and behavior, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Subsequently, a second room space design was constructed, incorporating both a solar chimney and a geothermal tube system. The combined design is visually represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 4</xref>. Within this geothermal system, heated fluid (air) is circulated through the ground loop, instigating the transfer of heat to the cooler surrounding soil, rock, or groundwater. The integration of both solar chimney and geothermal components aimed at enhancing the thermal efficiency and sustainability of the room space.</p>

      <p>Post the CAD modeling of the room space with a solar chimney, meshing of the model was carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. This process was executed using fine relevance settings for the chimney, both with and without the geothermal mechanism, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

        </fig>
      
      <p>A growth rate of 1.1 was established for meshing, ensuring an accurate and detailed mesh, with the curvature angle set at 120 to effectively capture intricate details. For the design with only the solar chimney, the meshing procedure generated 32,148 elements and 67,269 nodes. These elements and nodes comprise a discretized representation of the model, enabling an analysis of thermal behavior and mass flow rates within the room space.</p><p>Similarly, for the room design that integrates the geothermal system, the meshing procedure yields a total of 1,710 elements and 3,890 nodes. This refined mesh aptly encapsulates the geometric intricacies of the room space, enabling precise CFD simulations to scrutinize the thermal behavior and mass flow rates. Despite the reduced number of elements and nodes compared to the solar chimney-only design, the resultant mesh maintains an adequate level of accuracy and resolution necessary to capture the detailed features of the geothermal system. This optimized mesh permits efficient simulations, offering critical insights into the performance and effectiveness of the geothermal system within the room space.</p><p>By deploying appropriate meshing techniques and settings, the generation of reliable numerical models that aptly represent the room designs was ensured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>]. These meshes constitute the foundation for subsequent accurate and enlightening simulations, contributing substantially to an all-encompassing analysis and comparison of the two designs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 6</xref>. Notably, these techniques facilitate a more efficient evaluation of the geothermal system within the room space, thereby enhancing the understanding of its thermal behavior and effectiveness, and advancing knowledge in this field of study.</p>

      <p>Subsequent to the meshing procedure, loads and boundary conditions were meticulously imposed on the computational domain as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_7">Figure 7</xref>. Recognizing the airflow and heat transfer characteristics within the room space, the domain type was determined as fluid. Given the specifics of this study, air was designated as the fluid material for the domain, and the turbulence model employed was the k-omega model, known for its efficacy in capturing turbulent flow behavior. To provide a realistic representation of heat transfer within the room space, the thermal radiation model employed throughout the domain was the Monte Carlo method, which accounts for complex surface interactions and their radiative exchanges.</p><p>The exacting configuration of loads, boundary conditions, and material properties, tailored to align with the unique requirements of this study, helped to ensure a credible representation of the physical phenomena within the computational domain.

      <p>A meticulous comparison of average temperatures has been conducted between two designs: one lacking a geothermal system and the other incorporating it. The analysis reveals a notable discrepancy in average room temperature between the two designs. The design incorporating the geothermal system shows a significantly lower average room temperature than the one lacking it. This remarkable reduction in average room temperature is attributed to the efficient heat exchange and cooling provided by the geothermal system.</p><p>The geothermal system capably harnesses the stable and cooler underground temperature to extract heat from the room, leading to a more balanced and comfortable indoor environment. With the inclusion of this sustainable technology, the design integrating the geothermal system encourages energy efficiency and enhanced thermal comfort within the room space. These findings underline the importance of integrating green and sustainable technologies, like the geothermal system, into building designs. Such technologies are pivotal in reducing energy consumption, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving the overall well-being of occupants.</p>

      <p>By optimizing the integration and operation of sustainable systems like the geothermal system, architects and engineers can foster energy-efficient and environmentally conscious buildings that positively contribute to climate change mitigation and a more sustainable future. These insights are crucial for inspiring innovation and encouraging environmentally responsible building practices for a greener and healthier built environment. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, the average mass flow rate comparison provides a distinct visual representation of the substantial difference between the two room designs.</p><p>A notable enhancement in the mass flow rate is observed within the room incorporating the geothermal system as opposed to its counterpart, which lacks such an arrangement. This observation underscores the efficacy of geothermal system integration in augmenting airflow and ventilation in the room space. The elevation in mass flow rate within the design that incorporates the geothermal system is indicative of superior air exchange, an element fundamental to ensuring thermal comfort, better indoor air quality, and increased energy efficiency. The efficient heat exchange facilitated by the geothermal system contributes to a more harmonious and well-ventilated environment, fostering a healthier and more appealing indoor atmosphere.</p><p>Such results elucidate essential aspects of sustainable building design and accentuate the importance of renewable energy systems such as geothermal systems. The inclusion of such eco-friendly technologies enables architects and engineers to enhance room space performance, curtail energy consumption, and mitigate overall environmental impact.</p><p>The information gleaned from the average mass flow rate comparison chart offers valuable insights, fostering the growth of sustainable building practices and the advancement of green energy solutions within the construction industry. Through the careful integration of renewable energy systems, building designs can be brought into alignment with sustainability principles and contribute meaningfully to a more environmentally conscious future. Consequently, the overall performance and efficiency of building spaces can be elevated, leading to increased comfort and well-being for occupants while diminishing environmental footprint.</p><p>To deepen the understanding of these findings, future research may investigate the implementation of these sustainable systems in different climatic conditions and building configurations. Evaluating their performance under various conditions can provide broader insights into the versatility and adaptability of these systems. Moreover, long-term monitoring of these systems may be beneficial to assess the durability and maintenance requirements, further contributing to the optimization of their design and operation. By extending the scope of investigation, architects, engineers, and policymakers can be better equipped to make informed decisions and drive the widespread adoption of these sustainable building practices.</p>

      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>This research endeavored to elucidate the thermal performance and airflow dynamics within a room outfitted with a geothermal system, and a comparative analysis was performed with a room bereft of such an arrangement. The intention was to quantify the enhancements facilitated by the geothermal system, elucidate on practical implications for professionals in architecture and engineering, propose prospective future work, and acknowledge the study's limitations.</p><p>The conducted simulations unveiled that the room supplemented with the geothermal system registered an average temperature of 302.2 Kelvin, a figure roughly 7.4 Kelvin lower than the room without the geothermal system, which recorded an average temperature of 309.6 Kelvin. Furthermore, the room equipped with the geothermal system witnessed a mass flow rate of $4.134 \times 10^{-6}<inline-formula>
