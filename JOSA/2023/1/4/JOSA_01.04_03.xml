      <abstract>In the realm of managerial decision-making, particularly within the last few decades, the process has emerged as a formidable challenge. This paper focuses on strategic decision-making, crucial in determining organizational success or failure amidst prevailing uncertainties. To address this, the Matrix Approach to Robustness Analysis (MARA), a recent innovation, is integrated with the established Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) matrix. This integration aims to deliver robust outcomes in strategic planning for travel agencies. The methodology involves a comprehensive analysis of internal and external factors pertinent to a travel agency, applying the analytical rigor of the SWOT matrix. Subsequent to this analysis, a series of strategies are formulated. Central to this study is the identification of key environmental indicators, as perceived by stakeholders, which influence strategic outcomes. Through these indicators, various future scenarios are constructed, culminating in nineteen plausible scenarios. Each strategy, totalling twelve, is then evaluated against these scenarios to ascertain the conditions under which they are most effective, resulting in a performance matrix. The final phase involves calculating the robustness analysis scores for each strategy under two different assessment conditions: rigorous and lenient. These scores provide a basis for strategy prioritization in both scenarios. The analysis reveals that the strategy of expanding new pilgrimage tours holds the greatest promise, while the employment of relatives within the agency is deemed least effective. This study contributes to the field by offering a structured methodology for travel agencies to navigate uncertain environments, using a combination of MARA and SWOT. The findings underscore the importance of scenario-based strategic planning and robustness analysis in enhancing decision-making processes.</abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>In the current global landscape, organizations and social institutions confront a complex milieu, both within their internal structures and in the external environment. It has been observed that the business environment has undergone significant transformations, necessitating the evolution and adaptation of organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. The capacity of these entities to adapt effectively to environmental changes has become a critical factor for their survival and prosperity. Embracing change as an integral component of the modern business paradigm is essential for organizational success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>].</p><p>Effective management of organizations now requires a holistic and systemic approach. This approach must encompass a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing organizational performance, enabling strategies that address the impacts of both internal and external elements. Such a strategic approach is vital for exerting influence and control over these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to previous eras, where organizational decisions were predominantly driven by customer needs and shareholder profitability, the contemporary competitive landscape demands a focus on satisfying a broader spectrum of stakeholder groups. This shift is crucial for organizational growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. The balancing act between satisfying the immediate and long-term demands of both internal and external stakeholders has become a cornerstone for management in ensuring organizational survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Sustainable survival and growth, especially in the face of challenges such as declining demand, reduced investment activity, currency fluctuations, and other unpredictable economic conditions, are paramount for economic success across industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. </p><p>However, during economic recessions, sustainable growth may impede a company's development, potentially leading to reduced shareholder income and, frequently, bankruptcy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. The aviation industry, a critical sector within the tourism and transportation domain, exemplifies these challenges. Operating in an intensely competitive environment, airlines must engage in prudent decision-making to ensure their sustainability and continued existence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>].</p><p>Conventional strategic decision-making in organizations has often relied on the assumption that future events can be predicted accurately, thus guiding their strategic direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. This approach, however, has demonstrated limitations, particularly in its tendency to overlook or underestimate the inherent uncertainties of the business environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. The premise that future events are predictable with a high degree of certainty, based on the efficacy of an organization's strategic analysis, has been increasingly challenged. In reality, business environment changes are frequently unpredictable, leading to potential missed opportunities or unanticipated challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>].</p><p>The global market for products and services experiences continuous fluctuations, with organizations gaining a competitive advantage by detecting market imbalances before their competitors. This advantage enables them to introduce new offerings, adjust their value propositions, and capitalize on emerging opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Traditional strategic analysis methods have shown diminished effectiveness in such dynamic market conditions. Analysts are now required to adopt novel approaches for assessing market conditions and environmental uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. This involves recognizing and evaluating the impact of external factors, including market trends, competitors, and technological advancements, to inform decision-making processes.</p><p>To navigate this uncertainty, various methods and models have been developed, both within strategic and non-strategic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Some scholars have focused on enhancing classical strategy selection models, such as Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) and SWOT analysis, under conditions of uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Another category of models includes the multi-criteria decision-making approach, which offers a more nuanced evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>].</p><p>SWOT analysis, in particular, serves as a fundamental tool for organizations to assess their internal and external environments amidst uncertainties. It systematically evaluates an organization’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, aiding in the identification of both internal and external factors that can influence success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>]. Opportunities often refer to favorable external factors and the potential to address gaps or launch new initiatives, while threats encompass external challenges to organizational success. Importantly, opportunities and threats may also arise internally. Strengths are internal attributes that facilitate goal achievement, whereas weaknesses are internal elements that could limit or impede growth. Thus, SWOT analysis provides a comprehensive framework for organizations to evaluate their internal and external landscapes.</p><p>SWOT analysis, recognized extensively in strategic planning literature, has been widely employed to assess an organization's position and strategize accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_18">18</xref>]. Despite its extensive application across diverse fields, the literature has often been too generalized or overly field-specific, thereby lacking a comprehensive perspective on its utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Another tool frequently used in strategic decision-making is the QSPM, which assists in evaluating strategic options and their relative appeal. The QSPM is designed to assess the feasibility and sustainability of strategies within the context of organizational and environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>]. Effective role planning across various managerial levels is imperative for organizational success.</p><p>A significant challenge in decision-making, particularly in uncertain environments, is the difficulty in accurately forecasting future conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]. This challenge is addressed by evaluating internal preferences for future options while maintaining the flexibility to select them. It involves assessing different potential outcomes for each decision, ensuring that choices remain viable over time. It is widely acknowledged that classical strategic planning approaches are insufficient in addressing uncertainties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_21">21</xref>].</p><p>Robustness analysis, particularly valuable in highly uncertain scenarios, falls under the Interpretive paradigm and is a part of soft operations research. This method is pertinent in addressing management and organizational issues, especially where human factors are significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_22">22</xref>]. It is employed to evaluate the long-term implications of decisions made under uncertain conditions. The process necessitates implementing and assessing successive decisions to confirm their durability. This analysis involves the development of future scenarios, a profound understanding of the problem, and the factors influencing outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. It includes creating multiple potential future scenarios and evaluating their impact on the organization or management issue. Techniques such as scenario writing and Futurology are instrumental in identifying possible futures and their probable outcomes based on current situations. Robustness analysis then assists in identifying stable factors across scenarios and understanding their primary influences, thereby facilitating decision-making under uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the integration of SWOT analysis and robustness analysis is explored for strategy selection. Initially, potential strategies are identified using SWOT analysis, which are then prioritized through robustness analysis. The subsequent sections of this study demonstrate the application of this integrated approach in a case study.</p>

      <title>2. Literature review</title>
      <p>Arulmozhi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_25">25</xref>] explored the factors influencing the growth of medical tourism in India through a SWOT analysis. Primary data were collected from 372 medical tourists, predominantly from countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Respondents were randomly selected and surveyed using a seven-point scaling technique to gather their opinions and feedback. The study underscored the significance of analyzing hospital performance and other determinants for medical tourists. It posited that India's leadership in global medical tourism hinges on enhancing foreign policies related to medical visas and treatment processes.</p><p>In another study, Tanriverdi and Kucukyilmaz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_26">26</xref>] investigated the experiences of airlines with cooperative strategies. Interviews with five senior managers using a semi-structured approach revealed the crucial role of cooperative strategies for airlines' survival in the industry. The study suggested that competition boards should offer guidance on methods that are advantageous for airlines.</p><p>Mustika and Aditya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_27">27</xref>] focused on the tourism village of Kampong Tajor, aiming to identify its SWOT and to develop strategies for tourism development. Their empirical analysis highlighted the vulnerability of rural areas to the influx of tourists and emphasized the necessity for policies to enhance their advantages, minimize weaknesses, address threats, and capitalize on opportunities. The study recommended leveraging comparative advantages to bolster the tourism sector in the region.</p><p>Barati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_28">28</xref>] conducted a study to devise a composite method for strategizing and selecting developmental approaches for rural cooperatives. This research integrated SWOT analysis, the TOWS matrix, and the Analytical Network Process (ANP). Input was solicited from experts, including 10 CEOs of rural cooperatives and senior personnel from the central organization of rural cooperatives, using a brainstorming technique to analyze the external and internal environments of these entities. Subsequent to identifying key SWOT factors, a TOWS matrix was constructed to generate strategic alternatives, which were later prioritized using the ANP. The study unearthed 19 crucial strategic factors, such as deficiencies in management knowledge and the ability to enhance value and supply chains. Furthermore, 11 strategic alternatives were identified, including public policy implementation, technical and financial service provision, and the facilitation of input procurement, supply, and value chain development. The hybrid approach was posited as beneficial for decision-makers and managers in adopting optimal strategies and alternatives for the development of rural cooperatives.</p><p>In their research, Dimić et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_29">29</xref>] introduced a strategic transportation management model. Employing SWOT analysis, the study evaluated impacting factors to formulate a sustainable transportation strategy. The strategic options were developed through SWOT analysis, and the optimal selection was achieved using ANP based on the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The Serbian Oil Industry (NIS) implemented this model in the production and transportation of oil derivatives. The findings demonstrated the model's successful application in profit-oriented organizations and its utility in strategy formulation based on scientific principles, thereby creating conditions conducive to the successful execution of sustainable strategies.</p><p>Yang's study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_30">30</xref>] focused on developing an appropriate logistics strategy for Hangzhou Airport. The research highlighted the airport's logistical weaknesses and threats, suggesting the need to capitalize on opportunities to enhance airport logistics, including accelerating infrastructure construction, strengthening the information system, and forming strategic alliances. These findings offer practical guidance for the logistics development of Hangzhou Airport.</p>

      <title>3. Methodology</title>
      <p>The methodology of this research commences with the assembly of a matrix encapsulating internal strengths and weaknesses, along with external opportunities and threats, as perceived by research experts. It is imperative to focus on the most critical factors in this matrix to ensure that the derived strategies adequately reflect the influence of each factor. The MARA facilitates this process, as it does not impose any constraints on the computational aspect, allowing for an expansion in the number of strategies without hindrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_31">31</xref>].</p><p>The second stage involves the alignment of internal strengths with external opportunities and threats, leading to the formulation of SO<sub>i </sub>and ST<sub>i</sub> strategies (where i=1,2,...,n). Similarly, the matching of internal weaknesses with external opportunities and threats results in the identification of WO<sub>i</sub> and WT<sub>i </sub>strategies. This stage is characterized by the absence of limitations on the number of strategies that can be formulated.</p><p>In the third stage, the most salient indicators related to environmental factors, encompassing political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal aspects, are listed. These indicators, which significantly impact the business and the implementation of organizational strategies and decisions, are prioritized based on their importance, with decision-makers selecting the most crucial indicators from each category.</p><p>The fourth stage requires the problem owners to ascertain the possible states for all selected indicators from the preceding stage. For each indicator, a minimum of two states should be envisaged. The number of future scenarios is determined by the product of the different states of these indicators. For instance, if an indicator such as political relations has two states (peace and war), and another indicator like national currency value has three states (increase, robustness, and decrease), the total number of future scenarios would be calculated accordingly (18 = 2 × 3 × 3).</p><p>In the fifth stage, future scenarios undergo a refinement process, where implausible scenarios are eliminated. This refinement is conducted from two perspectives: firstly, by excluding states of indicators deemed unlikely to occur, and secondly, by removing scenarios with contradictory states of indicators. For instance, if it is established that an increase in the national currency value is improbable during the planning period, this state is excluded, reducing the number of future scenarios (12 = 2 × 3 × 2).</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

For example, the first column (Strategy 1) indicates optimal performance under conditions of peace, stable national currency value, and high access to global markets.</p><p>The final phase of this methodology involves a critical alignment of the Scenario (S) and Performance (P) matrices to ascertain the robustness score for each strategy. The process entails a meticulous comparison of each strategy's respective column in matrix P against the columns of matrix S. In this context, every instance where a strategy aligns with a scenario is awarded a positive point. For illustrative purposes, the robustness of the first strategy is evaluated by juxtaposing its column in matrix P with each column in matrix S. For example, in the first scenario, if all criteria match, the performance score for strategy 1 is determined as 3. Conversely, in scenarios where there are fewer matches, as in the second scenario, the performance score may be lower. This assessment is systematically conducted across all scenarios.</p><p>Upon completion of these comparisons, the robustness score for each strategy is calculated as the sum of its performance across the spectrum of scenarios. This robustness score is a crucial metric, reflecting the strategy's overall effectiveness and adaptability in various hypothetical situations. Subsequently, strategies are prioritized based on their robustness scores, presented in a descending order, illustrating their relative strength and feasibility in diverse future conditions.</p>

      <p>The initial phase of implementing the proposed approach involved establishing a team to participate in the strategy selection process. This team included the CEO and technical director of Q-Parvaz Travel Agency. An introduction to the approach was provided, followed by a systematic progression through the specified steps.</p><p>The primary stage of this approach entailed the identification of potential strategies for the organization. Given the absence of a formal strategic document at Q-Parvaz Travel Agency, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the agency's owners. These interviews facilitated the identification of the agency’s strengths and weaknesses, as documented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>, and the external threats and opportunities, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. The SWOT matrix was then derived from these identified elements in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref>, leading to the formulation of twelve potential strategies for the travel agency, outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>.</p>

      <p>Given these states, a total of 144 future scenarios (2×2×3×3×2×2) were initially considered. To design more feasible future scenarios, the agency's owners conducted a refinement process over a five-year perspective. This process involved two steps: 1) Elimination of states deemed unlikely to occur, and 2) Removal of scenarios with contradictory states. Expert analysis facilitated the refinement of possible scenario states, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>.</p>

In this scenario, political robustness within the country is sustained, inflation rates remain stable, exchange rate fluctuations are minimal, market size experiences growth, and a facilitation in regulatory frameworks is observed. Through a rigorous refinement process, scenarios deemed infeasible by the agency's owners were excluded, culminating in the extraction of matrix S comprising 19 distinct scenarios.</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

</inline-formula>.</p><p>The final stage involved a comparative analysis between matrices S and P to calculate the robustness scores of the strategies. To ascertain the robustness of each strategy, a corresponding column in matrix P was matched against columns in matrix S (scenarios). Positive scores were allocated for each strategy under specific conditions within this matching process. This scoring was conducted in two distinct modes: rigorous and lenient. The outcomes of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>.</p>

          <p>In the rigorous mode of analysis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> illustrates the matching of the scenario matrix (S) with the performance matrix (P) for Q-Parvaz Travel Agency. Each column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref> corresponds to a specific scenario, while each row represents the performance of a strategy within that scenario. The strategies were assessed for their robustness across various environmental conditions, with each match between the scenario and the strategy's performance earning a positive score.</p><p>This rigorous scoring approach provided a detailed and stringent evaluation of each strategy's effectiveness in different potential future states. The strategies were then ranked based on their cumulative scores across all scenarios, offering a comprehensive view of their viability in varying conditions.</p><p>In the rigorous evaluation mode, the final scores of each strategy across different scenarios were color-coded in red at the end of each strategy row. In this mode, scores ranging from 0 to 3 were assigned a value of 0, and scores between 4 and 6 were assigned a value of 1. This led to the formulation of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref>, which presents the final scores of strategies in various scenarios under rigorous conditions.</p>

          <p>In the lenient evaluation mode, the final scores of strategies in diverse scenarios were marked in red at the end of each strategy row. Scores ranging from 0 to 2 were assigned a value of 0, and scores from 3 to 6 were allocated a value of 1.

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>This study integrated two established approaches to address uncertainty in strategy selection, applying this combined methodology in a case study.</p><p>In the initial phase of the study, matrices encapsulating internal strengths and weaknesses, along with external opportunities and threats, were compiled based on the inputs from the problem owners, as delineated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref>. This was followed by aligning the identified strengths with environmental opportunities and threats, leading to the formulation of potential strategies, as documented in the SWOT matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_4">Table 4</xref>). Subsequently, the study employed the PESTEL (i.e. political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal) analysis framework to evaluate critical environmental factors influencing business operations and the efficacy of organizational strategies. This assessment, guided by the problem owners' perspectives, involved an expert scoring method, where impacts were categorized as no impact (0), low impact (1), and high impact (2), as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_5">Table 5</xref>. Among the array of indicators, several were identified as paramount due to their significant impact on the research context. These included diplomatic relations with other countries and political robustness (categorized under the political index), inflation rate and exchange rate fluctuations (economic index), market size potential (social index), and government regulations (legal index).</p><p>In a subsequent step, the owners delineated various potential states for each selected indicator, as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_6">Table 6</xref>. Based on these predetermined states, a total of 144 future scenarios were initially considered (2×2×3×3×2×2). To enhance the feasibility of these future scenarios, a refinement process was undertaken, focusing on two aspects: the elimination of states deemed implausible and the removal of scenarios with contradictory indicator states. Through expert analysis, the refined and plausible states of these scenarios were predicted and cataloged in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_7">Table 7</xref>.</p><p>Following the initial stage of scenario reduction, the number of potential scenarios was first narrowed down to 32 and eventually refined to 19, culminating in the formation of matrix S. The owners were then engaged to ascertain the conditions under which each of the 12 strategies demonstrated optimal performance, leading to the development of the performance matrix, denoted as matrix P.</p><p>The pivotal step involved the alignment of matrices S and P to calculate the robustness scores of the strategies. This process entailed matching each strategy's corresponding column in matrix P with the scenarios in matrix S. A positive point was allocated to a strategy for each effective match, with the final robustness score of each strategy being the cumulative total of its performance across all scenarios. This evaluation was conducted in two modes, i.e. rigorous and lenient, as determined by the problem owners, with the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_8">Table 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_9">Table 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_11">Table 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_12">Table 12</xref>. In the lenient mode, scores ranging from 0 to 2 were assigned a value of 0, while scores between 3 and 6 received a value of 1. Conversely, in the rigorous mode, scores from 0 to 3 were allocated a value of 0, and those between 4 and 6 were assigned a value of 1. The culmination of this research was the prioritization of strategies based on their robustness scores. This prioritization, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_10">Table 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_13">Table 13</xref>, was presented in both rigorous and lenient modes, ordered from the highest to the lowest priority.</p>
