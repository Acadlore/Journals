      <abstract><p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics into the warehouse management system (WMS) has substantially advanced supply chain (SC) operations, offering notable improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and economic resilience. In warehousing environments, AI algorithms and robotized systems enable rapid and precise product retrieval from storage while optimizing routing and packaging, thereby reducing order preparation time and enhancing delivery reliability. The implementation of these advanced technologies also results in fewer errors, improved customer satisfaction, and streamlined SC processes, empowering organizations to better manage inventory and respond swiftly to fluctuating market demands. Such innovations allow for reduced operating costs, enhanced productivity, and increased sustainability. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and drones, among other cutting-edge solutions, are increasingly incorporated into the WMS to minimize physical labor and mitigate workplace injuries. Despite these benefits, considerable challenges remain, including the high initial costs and requisite technical expertise for ongoing maintenance. The integration of new AI and robotic technologies into pre-existing systems necessitates careful evaluation, substantial employee training, and process adaptation. Nonetheless, these technologies play a crucial role in fostering environmentally and socially sustainable operations within warehouses and broader SCs, contributing to reduced carbon emissions and the elimination of hazardous tasks for human workers. This study aims to identify the most effective AI and robotic technologies for a sustainable WMS, with recommendations tailored to maximize SC value through automation. A detailed examination of existing warehouse practices is essential to pinpoint areas where automation can yield the most substantial impact and deliver long-term resilience and value for SCs.</p></abstract>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Robots and AI-based systems have significantly contributed to the improvement of all SC activities. They especially provide benefits to warehouse activities because they can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy, making the order fulfillment process significantly faster and more reliable. Robots can quickly and accurately pick products from shelves, while AI algorithms optimize routes and packing sequences, reducing the time needed to prepare orders for delivery to end users and increasing the efficiency of warehouse activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. In addition, these systems reduce the possibility of errors, resulting in greater customer satisfaction and SC efficiency. Warehouse automation enables companies and SCs to effectively manage inventory and respond to growing market demands, increasing overall productivity and reducing operating costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>]. In recent years, robots and AI-driven systems have improved the operations of warehouses. These advanced technological systems are reasonable in all warehouse activities, especially enabling faster and more accurate sorting, order picking, and packing of products, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the order fulfillment process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Automation as the base of robotic systems and AI technologies are mechanisms that have become crucial factors in boosting productivity and reducing operational costs in all parts of the sustainable SC. In a world where consumers increasingly expect fast and reliable delivery, these technologies play a vital role in meeting customer demands.</p><p>With advancements in robotics and AI, warehouses are evolving into intelligent hubs capable of optimizing every aspect of product management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>]. Warehouses represent a highly important part of a contemporary, prompt, and competitive market and a critical part of every SC. Companies have to ensure that goods can be carefully selected, appropriately packaged, accurately delivered, and efficiently delivered to customers, which coincides with the level at which warehouse operations are revolutionized by robots and AI systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. These technological innovations improve productivity, decrease human error, and optimize the delivery process, making SCs more resilient. To effectively manage warehouse operations, it is necessary to develop a WMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. This sophisticated software system facilitates the management of warehouse and distribution operations. WMS typically tracks inventory, manages warehouse locations, maximizes warehouse space, handles ordering and receiving items, and monitors the flow of commodities through the warehouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. WMS is frequently used in logistics operations to boost the accuracy of inventories, cut costs, and increase efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Consequentially, WMS is a crucial element in today's SC management, as it enables companies to more effectively manage their warehouses, reduce internal processes, and improve the sustainability and reliability of deliveries. To effectively implement warehouse activities, a sustainable WMS has been strengthened with modern Industry 4.0 solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Among them, robotic solutions based on AI benefits dominate, which significantly increase the productivity of the warehouse as well as the complete SC, reduce the engagement of workers in difficult, repetitive, and tiring activities, and significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.</p><p>The engagement of contemporary robotic technologies in logistics activities has a major positive impact on WMS efficiency, which serves as the foundation for resilient and intelligent SC's sustainable warehouse. Robots can swiftly and precisely select and arrange goods on shelves, and automated systems can boost warehouse productivity by 20% to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. The use of robotics lowers the error rate in product picking and placement, resulting in a 70% reduction in errors in warehouse operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Warehouses that are arranged vertically can have more available space by using robotic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. Up to 40% more storage capacity can be achieved with full automation. Because automation eliminates the need for manual labor, operating costs are reduced. Activities that can result in worker injuries can be taken over by robots, which can lower the hurt rate by at least 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>]. Robots' capacity to operate continuously around the clock, without a break, has been associated with a productivity increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. When compared to traditional technologies, warehouse productivity has increased by more than 50% with the implementation of contemporary robotic solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. According to these and other advantages, it is considered that automation logistics operations in the warehouse are an important challenge since it raises a lot of issues regarding the necessity of using robotic technology solutions.</p><p>The warehouse is one of the critical elements in the SC because it represents the connection between the supplier and the producer and between the producer and the user, but often the largest part of the activity in the SC is realized because the users are served from the warehouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. Due to numerous activities and challenges, the efficiency of the warehouse relies on a sustainable WMS based on the automation of logistics activities. A wide range of robotic solutions are available on the market that enable the improvement of all aspects of the WMS sustainability to meet the needs of resilient SC. Robotic technologies are required for economically beneficial, ecologically sustainable, and socially acceptable logistics activities within an efficient WMS. Automated technologies for logistic activities in the WMS concept significantly reduce non-productive time, increase material turnover, reduce damage to goods, and reduce errors in logistics assignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. The engagement of AGVs, robotic arms, automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS), AMRs, and drones is becoming a critical element of sustainable logistics activities in the WMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. These contemporary technology solutions are also based on the use of renewable energy sources; therefore, they are also environmentally sustainable. As they would be self-programmable, they could eliminate employee injury, which respects the pillar of social sustainability. Given the close connection between warehouse technologies and automation logistic processes, the essence of the WMS concept rests on robotization, material handling, and logistics activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Given the important environmental benefits provided by contemporary robotic and AI technologies, companies plan to use them to improve WMS sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. These technologies, which are primarily powered by electricity and tend to employ renewable energy sources, minimize carbon dioxide (<inline-formula>

Modern technology solutions in the warehouse are meant to substantially decrease human involvement in difficult, tiresome, and frequent activities and eliminate humans from dealing with dangerous substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>]. As a consequence, these contemporary robotic and AI technologies are regarded as socially sustainable, both in the warehouse and throughout the SC.</p><p>In evaluating robotic and AI technologies for warehousing, significant considerations to think about involve the kind and nature of warehousing activities, the size and structure of the warehouse, and the particular requirements of the company and its associated SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. The technology selection process commences with an examination of current warehouse procedures to determine which areas would benefit the most from automation.</p><p>The following phase is to assess the efficacy of existing and widely utilized technologies like AGVs, robotic arms, AS/RS, AMRs, and drones. The substantial initial costs are one of the most significant barriers to selecting and implementing these technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The costs of purchasing and deploying robotic systems can be high, necessitating careful and comprehensive economic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, integrating new technology with current systems can be complicated, necessitating employee adaptation and training. A further challenge is maintaining and servicing new technologies, which necessitates technical knowledge and more resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. As a result, one of the primary objectives is to guide the selection of automated and AI-based technologies to increase WMS sustainability.</p>

      <title>2. Some types of robotic and ai-based systems for a sustainable wms</title>
      <p>Industry 4.0 has generated many technologies that enable more economical handling of materials in the warehouse to increase SC resilience. These modern robots and AI technologies are environmentally friendly as they reduce harmful emissions and resource depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. They are also socially sustainable because they minimize the involvement of employees in difficult, repetitive, and tiring activities, freeing them from working with hazardous materials harmful to their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Although AMRs and drones are the most common innovative technologies for a sustainable WMS, this study also explores AGVs, robotic arms, and AS/RS as alternatives for sustainable warehouse material handling, which is critical in sorting, order picking, and packing goods as crucial customer service activities in resilient SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the technologies mentioned above were considered in further detail in this section, with a focus on their applications, benefits, and limitations, as well as potential implementation challenges for a sustainable WMS.</p>

          <p>Drones describe the cutting-edge, AI-based technology increasingly used in the WMS to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and safety of logistics operations. Their primary function is to transport small quantities of goods over short distances, but they also provide significant benefits in various aspects of warehouse management. One of the key applications of drones is inventory tracking, where they continuously scan barcodes and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, allowing for real-time tracking of product quantities and helping identify shortages or overstock circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. In addition, drones play a crucial role in supervision and security, as they can quickly inspect large warehouse areas, identifying potential security threats such as theft or vandalism, thereby enhancing the overall safety of the facility. Drones are also utilized for inspecting hard-to-reach or hazardous areas within the warehouse, such as high racks, ventilation systems, or storage areas that would typically require specialized equipment for human access. This not only improves safety but also streamlines maintenance processes. Moreover, drones are used for transporting small packages within the warehouse, reducing the need for manual labor and speeding up the delivery process, especially in large or multi-level facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>].

      <p>AMRs are robots that move around the warehouse autonomously, using sensors and advanced algorithms for navigation. They are highly flexible and can be used for various tasks, such as transporting goods or filling shelves. AGVs are vehicles that move along predetermined paths, often using magnetic strips or laser guides. Although less flexible than AMRs, AGVs are very reliable and can significantly increase efficiency in warehouses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. Robotic arms are designed to work close to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. They can perform tasks such as packing, sorting, and assembly. Flexibility and safety make them suitable for various warehouse applications. AS/RS are sophisticated systems for automatic storage and retrieval of goods. They are very effective but can be expensive and less flexible compared to other technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>]. Drones are used for inventory and inspection of warehouses. They enable quick and efficient inspection of high shelves and hard-to-reach places [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Energy consumption is a significant challenge when implementing robotic and AI-based technologies for the needs of a sustainable WMS. AGVs have a lengthy working life because of the batteries they use, but because they have to start and navigate the warehouse frequently, their energy consumption can be categorized as medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>]. The robotic arm uses a lot of energy during startup, accurate positioning, and stability maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>]. Energy is used by AS/RS to move storage units both horizontally and vertically. Their size and complexity determine how much is consumed, but it typically ranges from modest to high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Because AMRs use sophisticated algorithms to optimize routes and reduce energy consumption, they are energy-efficient devices that can operate over extended periods while using less energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. Drones require a lot of energy to power their rotors and keep them stable in the air, especially the more capable models that fly for extended periods or accomplish challenging tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. Although employee convenience is high for all systems, environmental friendliness, and training complexity vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_12">12</xref>]. While robotic arms and drones are more ecologically friendly, their utilization of the warehouse's height necessitates more difficult training due to understanding both the technologies and the warehouse's layout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>]. In contrast, AGVs and AMRs require less training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_7">7</xref>]. Although they require considerable training, AS/RS offer high levels of employee convenience and environmental friendliness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>].</p><p>During the implementation of contemporary technologies in the WMS, the time required for the adaptation of the preferred technology to the existing ones is of significant importance to the company. Thus, AGVs require a certain amount of time to map the warehouse, set up routes, and integrate with the existing WMS because they need additional time for adding markers and tapes and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. Implementing robotic arms often requires significant changes to the physical layout of the warehouse, programming of specific tasks, and adjustments of software integration with the WMS, which can be a complex and time-consuming process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. AS/RS require significant infrastructural changes, including setting up storage units, modifying existing layouts, and thorough integration with the WMS, all of which require considerable time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. In contrast, highly flexible AMRs are designed to be easily integrated with existing systems. The process includes storage mapping and software configuration but often does not require significant physical changes, which reduces adaptation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>]. The integration of drones may require the adaptation of inventory management software and procedures. Although it does not require significant physical changes, it takes time to reprogram routes and train employees, as well as adopt legal regulations when using drones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_15">15</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> provides a preliminary insight into the analyzed technologies that, when choosing the optimal one, indicates to companies the level of efficiency, flexibility, reliability, price, and the possibility of integration with existing systems in the warehouse. A comparative analysis is also provided for the aspects of energy consumption, environmental friendliness, employee benefits, training requirements, and the time of adaptation to the existing WMS. Based on this comparison, the company can have a basis for further analysis, which narrows its choice according to its requirements.</p><p>The prioritization of technologies for a sustainable WMS implies the engagement of environmentally friendly alternatives that can reduce environmental pollution and energy consumption and are based on sustainable energy sources. These technologies must be socially sustainable, reducing labor involvement in processes that involve handling heavy and bulky materials. Both of these aspects mandate the elimination of employees working directly with hazardous materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>]. As these pillars of the WMS sustainability are met by the development of robotics and AI technologies, companies face cost challenges. Accordingly, to rank robotic warehouse technologies with a budget, it is necessary to include cost estimates (including initial costs, maintenance costs, and operational costs) and their overall value for warehouses of different sizes and types. The operating costs of robotic technologies in warehouses include not only energy consumption but also maintenance costs, parts replacement, staff training, software upgrades, and other relevant costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_16">16</xref>]. The energy efficiency of robotic technologies in warehouses is an important aspect of optimizing operating costs and reducing carbon footprints. Constantly improving technology and managing energy use can lead to significant savings and increased environmental sustainability. Energy consumption of different robotic technologies in warehouses varies depending on specific tasks, frequency of use, load, management method, and other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_5">5</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_13">13</xref>].

      <p>Considering that all technologies minimize resource depletion and reduce pollution of the environment, it is evident that they respect environmental sustainability. Furthermore, robotic and AI technologies are also socially sustainable because they were initially developed to minimize employee engagement in tough and exhausting tasks while also eliminating the need for workers to handle hazardous chemicals. Nevertheless, one of the first issues to consider when a company is considering a certain technology is the possibility that it can provide an economic return on investment due to engaging financially demanding advanced technologies for a sustainable WMS.</p><p>To calculate how many years the investment can pay off, the formula for the investment return period (payback period) was used in this study. This formula determines the time required to recover the initial investment costs. The formula for investment payback period is as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_17">17</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_19">19</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>]:</p><p style="text-align: center"><inline-formula>

      <title>4. Implementing investigated robotic and ai technologies to increase wms sustainability</title>
      <p>In implementing particular robotic and AI-based technologies in the warehouse to increase the WMS sustainability, it is essential to comprehend the techno-exploitation parameters of the technology as well as the social and environmental advantages of their employment. However, the company primarily analyzes its economic possibilities, i.e., economic viability, when applying advanced technologies. For this purpose, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> was created in this study, which provides an insight into certain economic indicators based on which the cost-effectiveness parameters of the implementation of each examined technology were calculated. Acquisition costs, maintenance fees, and software expenses, along with labor costs, enabled the calculation of the payback period and BEP of the CBA. These analyses indicate that AS/RS technology is economically the most unsustainable and that, for its implementation, companies must consider the need and the activities it would implement. In addition, this technology is also low in flexibility, which indicates that it is difficult and takes a long time to adapt to new changes in the layout of the storage facility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref>). Even if it is highly sophisticated, environmentally friendly, and socially sustainable, it still requires significant investments and high implementation costs. Unlike this technology, using drones requires less investment. However, the company must look at other techno-operational characteristics of the technologies, their possibilities and requirements for the needs of a sustainable WMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_24">24</xref>].</p><p>AS/RS multi-component advanced technology is designed to utilize the height of the warehouse to quickly take products from the shelves, and is a fully automated system that is socially sustainable because there is no requirement to hire workers. It increases the utilization of storage space by at least 50%; therefore, its application is justified in warehouses that have a challenge related to maximizing the utilization of storage space. The insufficiency of the flexibility of AS/RS can be compensated by integration with other technologies, such as drones, which are intended for handling smaller loads at short distances and hard-to-reach positions. Drones are also suitable for monitoring the warehouse, but due to their low battery capacity, they are not suitable for transporting goods in the warehouse. This shortcoming can be compensated by AGVs as a reliable technology for the transportation of heavy and bulky goods in the warehouse. Even though these devices go on predetermined routes, this technology offers higher flexibility than AS/RS. However, all the need to eliminate workers from tedious and repetitive activities as well as engagement in working with hazardous materials is replaced by robotic arms and AMRs. Robotic arms have a high level of precision and accuracy in performing tasks such as packing, moving, and assembly. They can work 24/7 without breaks, increasing overall productivity, which also applies to AMRs. Although these two technologies do not require changes to the infrastructure of the warehouse facility, they can be cost-challenging as they require additional training and appropriate software support.</p><p>AGVs are self-moving vehicles that were first intended to be a superstructure for forklifts. AGVs can handle hazardous materials, including explosives, which is one of its numerous advantages over forklifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_10">10</xref>]. Because of their additional electrical components and explosion-proof construction, those devices can function in high-risk areas. When being given instructions, AGVs can follow a predefined path and stop at a certain location in the warehouse. Robotic arms are specialized for precise handling and manipulation of goods, often in stationary workplaces. They can carry out packing, sorting, and order picking with high accuracy and repeatability. They are also used to reduce errors caused by employees who need to be replaced in difficult and repetitive activities in the WMS. Despite being designed to automate warehouse tasks, AS/RS serve as the foundation for lowering losses and boosting material handling productivity in industrial operations. This technology, however somewhat pricey, makes it possible to utilize storage space more effectively, opening up possibilities for increasing the area set up for industrial operations. Inadequately configured AS/RS at startup could drastically lower material handling efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_20">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_23">23</xref>]. Thus, the primary drawback of AS/RS is the requirement for a more rational route design for the goods drop-off and pick-up system, which is required to improve material handling efficiency. As AS/RS are put into practice, they can assist logistics companies in increasing space utilization, preventing product damage, and reducing energy consumption, all of which are considered significant benefits. While some AMRs employ free navigation with lasers, other technologies use fixed features like beacons, magnetic strips, and magnets to locate themselves. These features imply that because of their dynamic and efficient employment allocation, AMRs are more effective when paired with other technologies in warehouses and collaborative work environments. Additionally, compared to AGVs supplemented by robotic arms, AMRs have far more sophisticated hardware and software that enable more effective applications for the requirements of a sustainable WMS. Their efficiency is confirmed by more than 200,000 AMRs engaged in Alibaba and Amazon. Drones are regarded as the most controversial autonomous material-handling technology. They have benefits such as eliminating the need for workers to touch materials, managing all industrial operations to save downtime, and the environmental benefits of using less electricity. However, the biggest barriers to their deployment are their restricted range and carrying capacity as well as the lack of adequate legal control. Since this technology may increase material handling volume up to four times, it is being employed more and more for sustainable material handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref_11">11</xref>]. The main reason it is used is that it can be easily integrated with other technologies, such as AGVs and AMRs.</p>

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>Optimizing all current warehouse practices has a direct link to how agreeably Industry 4.0 works and the level of autonomy used to carry out vulnerable material handling tasks and challenging logistics assignments. Due to growing e-commerce, widespread digitalization, and urbanization, companies are trying to improve their operations by introducing new autonomous technologies, strengthening customer support, and expanding their distribution network. Consumers prefer companies that can deliver items more quickly and affordably than competitors while still providing them with all the advantages of online ordering without limitations for buying in retail stores. Due to transferring logistic activities from production to the warehouse, deploying autonomous material handling technology provides the basis for a sustainable WMS. However, the selection of the appropriate technology for a sustainable WMS is dependent on not only the specific needs and goals of the warehouse but also the user's requirements and the need for increasing SC resilience. Accordingly, AMRs and robotic arms are suitable for flexible and diverse tasks, while AGVs and AS/RS are extremely efficient for highly specialized operations. Drones also have specific advantages, predominantly in control activities, and can be used as part of an integrated system to maximize the WMS sustainability.</p><p>In practice, there are numerous positive experiences regarding incorporating advanced Industry 4.0 technologies in the current WMS. Amazon has implemented a combination of Kiva robots, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to optimize their fulfillment centers, significantly reducing the time from order placement to delivery. The British online supermarket Ocado uses sophisticated AS/RS and AI-driven logistics to ensure efficient and accurate order fulfillment. According to Deloitte, deploying robotic technologies can lower operational costs by 50%. Besides, Amazon Fulfillment Centers use AMRs to transfer goods between different parts of the warehouse. Toyota factories use AGVs to transfer parts between production lines. DHL uses robotic arms for packing and sorting tasks. Wal-Mart uses AS/RS to store and retrieve goods quickly and accurately. IKEA uses drones for inventory and warehouse inspections.</p><p>Regarding the examples of good practices, the technical characteristics of advanced technological solutions, and the requirements for improving the WMS sustainability, companies face numerous challenges in adopting robotic and AI alternatives in warehouses. Specifically, the warehouse is a critical part of the SC because it integrates the activities of production companies and those in service of users. As current geopolitical circumstances focus on e-commerce and online ordering, the warehouse requires a sustainable WMS to increase SC resilience. Consequently, companies often resist the benefits of advanced Industry 4.0 technologies due to the high costs of their implementation, demanding maintenance, the need for additional employee training, and so on. However, from the perspective of a sustainable WMS, these technologies are environmentally friendly because they use clean propulsion, reduce harmful emissions, and reduce energy consumption. They are also socially acceptable because they were developed to replace a person in difficult, tedious, and repetitive jobs, which encourages their creativity at work. Contrary to the mentioned benefits, there are certain limitations in the implementation of the analyzed technologies as follows:</p><p>• Electric drives are often replaced by those with fossil fuels;</p><p>• Among employees, there is a justified fear of losing their jobs, especially for the lower-qualified workforce;</p><p>• The implementation of advanced technologies brings numerous challenges in terms of economic sustainability.</p><p>Considering the numerous contradictions of the analyzed technologies, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table_2">Table 2</xref> provide some basic guidelines for choosing a technology for the needs of a sustainable WMS. Thus, for drones and robotic arms, it is concluded that they are solutions that are not expensive to implement and maintain, are flexible with existing WMS technologies, and are environmentally friendly because they consume little energy, which is why they have low costs of exploitation. However, because such devices have limited carrying capacity and are not self-sufficient in completing storage tasks, they have the greatest potential for integration with existing technologies, as well as with AMRs, AGVs, and AS/RS, which are sophisticated advanced technologies that independently perform storage activities, increasing the WMS sustainability. However, AS/RS are expensive to implement and maintain and have high exploitation costs, but they are one of the most commonly used advanced technologies because they contribute the most to increasing the utilization of storage space. Given the growing importance of a sustainable WMS in resilient SCs, this technology is optimal for warehouses with a high turnover of goods. In contrast to these solutions, AMRs and AGVs are technologies that meet all the pillars of a sustainable WMS. The key difference is their primary activity, with AGVs for transport and AMRs primarily for material handling.</p>
